I don't think I can handle this
A cloudy day in metropolis
Well I think I'll talk to my analyst
I got it so bad for this little journalist

Drive me up the wall and through the roof
Lois and Clark in a telephone booth
I think I'm going out of my brain
I got it so bad for little Miss Lois Lane

Lois Lane please put me in your plan
Yeah, Lois Lane you don't need no super man
