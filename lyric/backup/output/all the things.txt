Hey baby, you said you need someone to be there for you
To love you all night long?
It's kinda funny but I don't think you have to look no further
Because I'm right here and I'm ready
To do all the things your man won't do

Tell me what kind of man would treat his woman so cold
Treat you like you're nothing when you're worth more than gold
Girl to me you're like a diamond I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure
I'd give the world to make you mine (la la la la la)
I'd put a string of pearls right in your hand
Make love on a beach of jet black sand
Outside in the rain we can do it all night
I'll touch all the places he would not
And some he never knew would get you hot
