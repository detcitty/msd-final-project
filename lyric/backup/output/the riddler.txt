Intro:

Dead crosswords, puzzling your delf
(Get yourrrrrrrr headpiece strapped on tight)
See, that's what I'm talkin bout
When you take the Johnny Blaze (you're dealing with Johnny Blaze)
(the Johnny Blaze)
and you take that game and you plug that here into Bobby Steels
(ohh yeahhhhh)
Nowwwww you are playing with power
(yeahhhhh get that mouthpiece screwed on right dude)
(You're dealing with the Bobby Steels) with power
(the Bobby Steels) Now you are playing with power

Verse One:

I got your mind twisted
Unrealistic wavelength draining on your brain-strip inflicted
Crosswords puzzling your delf
Questioning your own mental health (yeah) it's like a maze within itself
(yeah) Check the grimey, slimey, slimey
Crim-inim-inal indivi-dual I be
Searching for the Dark Knight
Lurking in the shadows of the city (the city) he roll with jiggy
