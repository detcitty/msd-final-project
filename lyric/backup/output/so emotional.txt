I don't know why I like it
I just do

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head

I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own baby
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

Oh I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much

Oh I get so emotional baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional baby
