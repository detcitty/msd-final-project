Oh people look around you
The signs are everywhere
You left him for somebody other than you
To be the one to care

You're lost inside your houses
There's no time to find you now
Oh your walls are burning
And your towers are turning
I've gotta leave you here
And try to get down to the sea somehow

Rock me on the water
Sister won't you soothe my fevered brow
