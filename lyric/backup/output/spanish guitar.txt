A smokey room a small caf√©
They come to hear you play
And drink and dance the night away
I sit out in the crowd
And close my eyes
Dream you're mine

But you don't know
You don't even know that I'm there
I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me through the night

Till the dawn
I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me through all night long

All night long I'd be your song, I'd be your song
Fill my heart with
Every note you play
