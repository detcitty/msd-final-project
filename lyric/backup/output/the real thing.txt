So glad we got a good thing
You know you make my heart sing
You are the real thing
You know you make my heart sing

I’ve longed to have this chance
With you I feel romance
It’s all for love and I want it bad

Seeing you is just a turn on
And loving you, I want to hold on
There’s a feeling in my heart
That just won’t let you go
(Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ah)

I’ll hold on, I’ll keep on
(I’m holdin’ on)
