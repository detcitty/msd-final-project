I can tell you that love
Is too deep to be played on
Down the line, you'd find
Time would reveal who to count on

I'm well inclined to use the lines
That comes from the learning tree
Yeah, yeah, let the seed that grows
And ages old give us our destiny

Baby, you know
I could pick you up
Turn your life around
If you fall in love with me
I would build you up
Never let you down
If you fall in love with me

If you're having
Second thoughts from the past
I can cool you out
I've been there before
