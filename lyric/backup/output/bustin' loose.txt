Keep what you got
Until you get what
You need y'all

You got to give a lot
Just to get what
You need sometimes y'all

Gimme the bridge now

I feel like busting loose
Busting loose
Gimme the bridge now

I feel like busting loose
Busting loose now

Busting loose in the evening
Busting loose can be pleasing
Talking bout busting loose

Busting loose in the meantime
Busting loose makes you feel fine
Talking bout busting loose

Busting loose to my love jones
Busting loose to each his own
Talking bout busting loose y'all

Busting loose to my love jones
Busting loose to each his own
Gimme the bridge y'all

I feel like busting loose
Busting loose now
Gimme the bridge y'all

I feel like busting loose
Gimme the bridge now
Gimme the bridge now

I feel like busting loose
Busting loose

I said sha la, come on
