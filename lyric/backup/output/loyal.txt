I wasn't born last night

I know this hoes ain't right
But you was blowning up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ring nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart?
When she rather have a purse
Why give a bitch your inch?
When she rather have nine
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)
When a rich nigga want you

And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal

These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

Just got rich
Took a broke nigga's bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich

But I don't fuck with broke bitches
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the bay with me
Eyes closed smoking marijuana
