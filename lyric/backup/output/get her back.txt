All I wanna do
Is keep her love
Keep her love
Keep her satisfied
All I wanna do
Is make it right
Make it right
Is make you smile tonight
All I wanna do
Is give you that thing, play you that song you and your girlfriend sing
All I wanna do
Is get you back tonight
I gotta get her cool, get her cool, get her cool, get her back
I gotta get her cool, get her cool, get her cool, get her back
I gotta treat her right
I gotta cherish for life
I gotta get her cool, get her cool, get her cool, get her tonight

I never should have raised my voice or made you feel so small
I never should have asked you to do anything at all
I should have kissed you longer
I should have held you stronger
And I'll wait for forever for you to love me again
