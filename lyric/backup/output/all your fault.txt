People sayin' I'm the closest thing to Mike since Janet
Tom Cruise, homie, we jumpin' up on them couches
Thats a fresh house, is that a guest house
Your house got another house
Your bitch got a bitch, your spouse got another spouse
Young Walt Disney, I'ma tell you truthfully
If you leave Mickey you gon' end up with a Goofy
I imagine thats what Chris told Karrueche
Girls be actin' like it's diamonds in they coochie

But cops chokin' niggas out in the media
We finna have to protest and tear the city up
We bout to tear this whole place up pretty much
