I'm good at wasting time
I think lyrics need to rhyme
And you're not asking
But I'm trying to grow a mustache
I eat cheese, but only on pizza please
Sometimes, on a homemade quesadilla
Otherwise it smells like feet to me
And I, I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail
And I love you when you say my name

If you wanna know, here it goes
Gonna tell ya there's a part of me that shows
If were close gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm trying to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain, in my heart
Well, you asked for it
For your perusing
At times confusing
