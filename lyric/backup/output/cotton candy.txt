Hoo... hoo... 

A sweet thing
You're such a sweet thing
I call you cotton candy
You're my cotton candy

I've got a sweet tooth
That's hard to satisfy
When I'm short on sugar
You've got a full supply (Full supply)

Girl, don't be stingy
Gimme, gimme some
Girl, I can't live forever
On a diet of your love
