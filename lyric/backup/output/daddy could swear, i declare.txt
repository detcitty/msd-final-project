Oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, oh my mercy

Ooh, how I remember daddy
He was young and had
A built in tan yeah
And though he only stood
About a five feet seven
My daddy was a heck of a man
Yes he was, y'all

He loved us all and we knew it, yeah
Though he showed it in a very funny way
For most of the time
He was a-cussin' and fussin'
When he said what he had to say
Now, now, now

Daddy couldn't read
Daddy couldn't write
But one thing daddy sure could do right

He could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all
