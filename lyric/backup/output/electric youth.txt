Zappin' it to you, the pressure's everywhere
Goin' right through you
The fever's in the air, oh, yeah, it's there
Don't underestimate the power of a lifetime ahead

Electric youth, feel the power
You see the energy comin' up, coming on strong
The future only belongs to the future itself
And the future is electric youth
It's true you can't fight it, live by it
The next generation, it's electric

We've got the most time to make the world go round
Oh, can you spare a dime?
Place your bet on our sound, come back to town
