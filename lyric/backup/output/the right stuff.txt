I was standing at 7: 15 waiting for my baby's car
Just then out stepped the driver of a limousine
And asked if I was going far
I said I've got my mind made up
I don't wanna leave him baby cause it's clear to me
That it's just to tough to find another lover like mine

With the right stuff
The right stuff baby
