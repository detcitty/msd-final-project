Usher, baby I just wanna get your attention
I really wanna be all up in your head
Yeah, cause what I got, you goin' to get some
Yeah, but girl that's only if you ain't scared

And I won't knock or ring no bells
You just float that bottom up in the air
I'll get you hot, I know you, oh, so well
And when I walk in all that I wanna hear

Is you say daddy's home, home for me
And I know you've been waiting for this love in your day
You know your daddy's home and it's time to play
So you ain't got to give my loving away
