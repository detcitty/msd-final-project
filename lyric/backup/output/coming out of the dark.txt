Why be afraid if I'm not alone?
Life is never easy, the rest in unknown
Up to now for me it's been hands against stone
Each and every moment searching for what to believe

Coming out of the dark, I finally see the light now
And it's shinning on me
Coming out of the dark, I know the love that saved me
