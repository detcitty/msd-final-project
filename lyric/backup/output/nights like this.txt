shu bee doop do do doo oooo...
shu bee doop do do doo
shu bee doop do do doo oooo...
shu bee doop do do doo

[verse 1]
I could feel that it was over
your love for me
why couldn't you tell me you had
another on your mind?
its no way to treat me when you know
how i feel inside

I could not hide the way i felt last nite.
tears i cried
