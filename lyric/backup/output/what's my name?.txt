Eyah, the Dogg Pound's in the house
(The bomb)
Eyah, the Dogg Pound's in the house
Snoop Doggy, Dogg
(The bomb)
Snoop Doggy, Dogg
(Dog)

From the depths of the sea, back to the block
Snoop Doggy Dogg, funky as the, the, The D.O.C.
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
Long Beach is the spot where I served my cane

Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
But don't lose your grip, nine-trizzay's, the yizzear for me
To fuck up, shit, so, I ain't holdin' nuttin' back
And motherfucker I got five on the twenty sack

It's like that and as a matter of fact
(Rat-tat-tat-tat)
'Cuz I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
(Yeah, so peep out the manuscript
You see that it's a must we drop gangsta shit)
What's my motherfucking name?

Snoop Doggy, Dogg
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Snoop Doggy, Dogg
(The bomb)
Da-duh-da-da-dah
Do-do-do-do, doo-doo-doo-da-dahhh
(Dog)
