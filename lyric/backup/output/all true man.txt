When you need a friend
Someone you can lean on
Who will understand
Understand your problems

When you need a lover, woo
Someone who will satisfy
Don? t you call no other, no, no
Just call me anytime
I? ll be there to fulfill your every need

If you want a man strong, but sensitive
(Ooh, baby)
Anything you need, I? ll be willing to give

Every day and night
(Ah)
I will treat you right
You need an all true man
(I? m a man, I? m an all man)

When you need to cry
I? ll be there to dry your eyes
You don? t have to suffer no more
It? ll be alright

? Cause the secret to being complete
In your l-life
