We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah!

Show stoppin' at the latest spot
The ride shinin' with the open top
Hydraulics make our heads go nod
Hair blowin' in the breeze, yo we superstars

Put in the keys, make that engine purr
3 in the back, one in the passenger
Slow creepin' 'cause we look that fly
All the boys tryin' taste our candy pie

We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah!

Bet you ain't never seen chicks ridin' this clean
Louis Vuitton seats, we do it daily
That how we keep it poppin', make sure that bass knockin'
So when you see us ridin' we call it show stoppin'

We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
That's how we keep it poppin', make sure that bass knockin'
So when you see us ridin' we call it show stoppin'

We sittin' on 22's plus 2
Mink bucket seats, neon blue
