My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway

Me and Kid Sensation and that home away from home
In the black Benz Limo with the cellular phone
I'm callin' up the posse it's time to get rippin'
The freaks a need a sunroof to keep you suckas trippin'

Everybody's lookin' if your jealous turn around
The AMG kick keeps us closer to the ground
We're gettin' good grip from the 50 series tires
The Alpine's bumpin' but I need the volume higher

'Cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
We're rollin' Rainier, and the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do, the sucka M.C.'s wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate, the J.R. Ewing of Seattle

Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Headed for the strip, yes we're lookin' for some action
The limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leanin' back
Maharajah's watchin' T.V. with two girlies on his lap

On Martin Luther King, the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street so posse move ahead
We all look kinda' swass the crew you can't forget
The Mix-a-Lot posse co' rippen' up the set

My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
