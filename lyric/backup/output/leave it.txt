I can feel no sense of measure
No illusions as we take
Refuge in young man's pleasure
Breaking down the dreams we make
Real

One down one to go
Another town and one more show
Downtown they're giving away
But she never came back

No phone can take your place
You know what I mean
We have the same intrigue
As a court of kings
