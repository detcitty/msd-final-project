No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray
And then you will see the morning will come
And every day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see

I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel

I'm your angel

I saw your teardrops and I heard you cry
