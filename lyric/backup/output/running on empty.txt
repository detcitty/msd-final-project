Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In sixty-five I was seventeen and running up one-on-one
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

Running on-running on empty
Running on-running blind
Running on-running into the sun

But I'm running behind
