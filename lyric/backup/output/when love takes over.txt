It's complicated, it always is, that's just the way it goes
Feels like I've waited so long for this, I wonder if it shows?
Head under water now I can breath, it never felt so good.
Cause I can feel it coming over me I wouldn't stop it if I could

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
Cause something's here tonight
