I'm in war with the world and they
try to pull me into the dark.
I struggle to find my faith
as i'm slipping from your arms.

(It's getting harder to stay awake
and my strenght is fading fast
you breathe into me at last)

I'm awake! I'm alive!
Now i know what i believe inside.
Now it's my time!
I'll do what i want cause this is my life.
Here! (right here!)
Right now! (right know!)
(I stand my ground and never back down)
