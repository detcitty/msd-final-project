Just isn't fair, cuz I still care
Although I love you gurl, I'd rather be alone

You want me to forgive you
You said please understand
Gurl you made me a fool
I thought that I was your only man
You don't know how it hurts me
To learn that I was wrong
Though I gave you my heart
You were just playing me all along

Too late to work it out
Cuz I know my minds filled with to much doubt
To ever try it again
I guess deep down I know you'll have to go
