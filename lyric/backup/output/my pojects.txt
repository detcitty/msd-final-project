In my project (5x)

(Verse 1)
Dog my project is sweet 'n
But if you ain't from where I'm from, like some dog,
don't come or you gettin beatin
Yeah we cheatin dog that's automatic
We greedy, plus we try'n be the needy dawg wit all the Cadillacs
Steal from the rich and give to the poor
We sell a few drugs bust a few slugs and pimp a few hoes
Don't let us find a bit a higgidy
Dog we turn them stiggidies
With shorties off in riggidies
So if you ain't from here or wit my guys
Don't even roll through playa cuz all the traffic gettin minimized
Cries for help cuz you got carjacked
Niggaz 'll roll for a minute then pass it to the hypes to sell the car back
And once she get it, it be stripped down
Thugs, they got your system and your dubs and want your grip now
Ya'll betta give a hood respect
Cuz it pay to play for a day up in my projects

(Chorus)
In my projects
My projects thick
In my projects everybody is rich
In my projects
My projects thick
Don't come to my projects if you ain't wit dis clique
In my projects
My projects thick
