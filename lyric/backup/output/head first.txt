Well the first time that I saw ya
You looked down and out
And I had my doubts
About you

But baby since I've
come to know ya
I ain't got no doubts
What it's about

Me and baby
We're going out tonight
She's gonna treat me right
Ooh yeah
Me and sugar
We've got it all sewn up
She fills my loving cup
We're going head first

Well the second time that I saw ya
