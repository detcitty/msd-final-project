Static, Quik, you're not a gangster, we're not static

Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But, niggaz, like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know the money's got you safe and sound

Now I'm 'bout to take it back to '84, when I was fourteen
Kickin' back in the trees, West Side, if you please
And, four-thirty-six, West Spruce was the spot
With me, Wayne, Mike, Shot, Nookie, Slug and Rock

Donzelly, if ya with me, than let that shit, kick
If your head ain't spinning from dippin' all them sticks
'Cause way back in the day they used love a wet baggie
Screaming, HORALE, ESE, with them laces on a caddy

And you couldn't deny a hit from that Buddah, Tye
Going round and round the driveway, now it's coming my way
And I'm zoned out at a young age
And the whole spruce street was my stage

Peep, now back then I was in the eighth grade, steady
But niggaz, my age was getting paid, already
Yeah, like that nigga, Zam or even young, Blue
They made they first million by the age of, twenty-two

Like, Dan from Cedar block, him and little Motor
James from Piru Street, with them boulders
Rest in peace, little Noopy, he didn't have to brag
Rollin' to the tenth grade in a Fint, '0' rag

Well, goddamn, how can I be down?
I ask my sister, Jack for some help and she told me, look around
Nigga, they don't sell dope, it sells itself
While they kick back and just collect the wealth

And now I'm thinking, ain't nothing fly, about these dirty ass, khakis
T-shirt dingy, prowings tackie
This could be a way to flip that little, funky, twenty dollars, that I earned
Right then, is when I learned that
