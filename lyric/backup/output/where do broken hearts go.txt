Ooh...
I know it's been sometime
I've had something on my mind
You see I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I've learned

Is that I need you desperately
So here I am, and can you please tell me, oh?

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home?
Back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there
And if somebody loves you

Won't they always love you?
