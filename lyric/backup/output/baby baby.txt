Just because you want my loving
It's not enough to just turn me on
But when you touch me, oh!
I really feel it boy
That I don't wanna be left alone

I see you're using me
I won't be a fool
So see what you do to me
If you tell me true
I will, I will give my love to you

Baby baby just give me the real deal
Don't say maybe, my heart beats for you
Baby baby, you know how you make me feel
Never maybe, I'll give my love to you

Every time I see your picture
I call you up and you're not at home
Now don't you want me?
Or are you playing, boy?
You got me hanging out on my own
