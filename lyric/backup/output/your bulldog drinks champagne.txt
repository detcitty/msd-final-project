There was a lady in a window
In the room across the way
From the hotel I was staying in
While on my holiday
I couldn't help but see everything
'Cause I was peeping I confess
Still after dinner every night
She had the strangest guest

She'd retire to her favorite chair
And sit there with a dog
Fill the crystal glasses
While the fire danced on the log
I watched them drink their bubbly brew
Until the fire grew dim
