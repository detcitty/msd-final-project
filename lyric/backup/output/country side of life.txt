You can have your buildings and your heavy arithmetic
I don't need no crowded streets or city slicker tricks
I just need to be someplace where I can move around
Look down at my toes and I can still see the ground

Gimme that country side of life
Which way I can stretch out right
Gimme the countryside ooh lord
That country side of life
Which way I don't get uptight
