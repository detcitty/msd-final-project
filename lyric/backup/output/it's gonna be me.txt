It's gonna--be--me
Oooh, yeah
You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go, oh.
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry
Maybe that's why
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally,
Get to love somebody
Guess what,
