Aha okay what's up? Shut up
Aha okay what's up? Shut up
Aha okay what's up? Shut up
Aha okay what's up? Shut up

Ridin' 'round in my brand new '99, 4 do' Volvo
I got a pocket full of Bs
Cocoa weed and ain't got no place to go though
But all my Boca Boys they know though that's fo' sho' though

Are those Bugle Boy jeans you're wearing?
Hell nah, ho, you know they Polo, I been used again, chose again
This time been wrong to chop somethin'
Dumped by one of my Union friends

Soon as they seen the Benz hatin' season was in
Hell, 'cause they figured me for not understandin' their reason being
But I'm the man for this
While ya'll was doin' fine, I was doin' time

Just prayin' for this locked up, make a plan for this
Without all that fancy shit, way too advanced for this
Just Polo socks, tanks top, and drawers up
Under my pants and shit, shut up

Aha okay what's up? Shut up
Aha okay what's up? Shut up
Aha okay what's up? Shut up
Aha okay what's up? Shut up

Aha okay what's up? Shut up
Aha okay what's up? Shut up
Aha okay what's up? Shut up
Aha okay what's up? Shut up

Okay, who's the baddest bitch
