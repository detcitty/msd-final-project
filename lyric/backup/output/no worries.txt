You can look me in my face
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
See the sh-rooms keep me up
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
(I ain't got no worries)
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there we ain't got no worries

Tunechi in this bitch, e'rybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be digging me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear, have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleek
All these bitch think they're the shit, I sent them up shits creek
