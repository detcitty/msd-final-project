Girl, sometimes it seems to me
That I don't say the things I should, to you, I act like I'm no good
You wait for me patiently
This house is not a home without you, it takes two hearts to share

Your eyes will always see through me, and bring me to my knees
And I will always turn to you, you're everything I need
