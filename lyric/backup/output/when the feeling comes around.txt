We were walking in the sand I could feel your heart pound
A man and a woman, walking in the sundown
Maybe now I'll understand how you feel the way you do
We all have the same emotion, Baby I can feel it too

It's like the rocking of the ocean
The rolling of the sea
When the feeling comes around
When the feeling comes around

I have looked for love before
