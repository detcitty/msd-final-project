Oh (whoa)
It's gonna be a big night (whoa)
We're gonna have a good time (whoa)

It's gonna be a big big big big big big big night

1, 2, 3, all my boys and girls
We're gonna party like it's the end of the world
Let's get it started (hey!)
Started (hey!)

Started (hey!)(whoa oh)
Waiting on weekends, it's Friday night
We're gonna get dressed up
For the time of our lives

Let's get it started (hey!)
Started (hey!)
Started (hey!)
'Cause I been feeling down, down, down

I need a pick me up
Round, round, round
I wanna spin it up
