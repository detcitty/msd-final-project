Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Is my microphone on
One, two, one, two
Is my microphone on, one, two

Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Is my microphone on
One, two, one, two
Is my microphone on, one, two

[CHORUS]
What you want me to do
Put my foot in it
What you want me to do
Put my hands in it
What you want me to do
Put my butt in it
Hey, hey, hey, hey

What you want me to do
Put my back in it
What you want me to do
Put my head in it
What you want me to do
Put my tongue in it
Do what you want, like that

Sitting at a party
Nothing really jumping now
Hey, hey

Girls just wanna kick it
Guys just wanna stick it
Can you tell me what to do
Do da what, do da what
Do da what

[Repeat CHORUS]

What you want me to do
Put my back in it
I don't know what to do
Put my head in it
What you want me to do
Put my tongue in it
Do what you wanna do

We came out here to party
Not to stand against the wall
No, no

Party's acting real fine
After the sing down
What is a girl to do
