Going to a go-go
Going to a go-go

Well, there's a brand new place I found
Where people come from miles around
They come from every world and if you drop in there
You might see anyone in town

Going to a go-go Everybody
Going to a go-go Come on now
Don't you wanna go, yeah

Oh, sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
Oh, I can't help myself
