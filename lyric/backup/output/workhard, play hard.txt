Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work, work
Work, work
Work, work
Work, work
Diamonds all on my ring nigga
Gold watches, gold chain nigga
Hundred thou' on champagne nigga
Yeah my money insane nigga
Yeah I'm making it rain nigga
But I was just on the plane nigga
Buying gear, flying here
Fuck what you heard, it's my time of year
If I'm in the club, I get a hundred stacks
I'm always rolling up so I get love for that
Them niggas stole my swag but I don't want it back
My nigga uh! I was on this, but now I'm onto that
You see it in my closet before it's on the rack
Was out there in Hawaii, now I'm goin back
My nigga uh! I got so much money I should start a bank
