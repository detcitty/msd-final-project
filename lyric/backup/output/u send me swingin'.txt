U send me swingin'
Oh, u send me swingin'

I wait for the day, a sweet gentle sway
Brought your love right my way
Oh, u send me swingin', u send me swingin'
Oh, u send me swingin'

I never thought I'd really find, someone so beautiful and kind
Oh, what you've done to me, with just the little things you do
You've got me crazy over you, and it's getting stronger
When I'm with you, I fall deeper in love, swingin'
