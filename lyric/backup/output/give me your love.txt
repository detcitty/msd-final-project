Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby... 

Want you so bad
Can't even get mad at you
What a thing, you really swing
And I feel so good, it's true

You said you're gonna make my lung
Start breathing in the air
Through loving you
I really know, child
Just how much I care

Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
