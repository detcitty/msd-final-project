All along, we knew it wasn't right
We were standing sound, losing sight
Play a game that isn't fair
And your partner's left standing there

At least you know you dream alone
Sometimes feel your heart's made of stone
Have to try to move your chessmen right
But your feelings, you're still trying to fight

Then you start to
Feel the heat, feel the heat
As you feel the time is turning
Then your mind just starts to
