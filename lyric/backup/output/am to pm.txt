Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night,
People getting' down, that's right, from AM to PM.
Everybody lookin' like stars, all the chicks and the fellas in the bars,
All of y'all bumpin' this in your cars, from AM to PM

Bloodshy. Milian

Everybody wanna get down when you hear the sound and you bump the beat.
Three sixty-five days a year, twenty-four a day, seven days a week.
Now when you're driving in your four by four and you turn this up on your stereo,
Whether night or day, non-stop you'll play, and you know you still want more.

So find a honey that's standing on the wall, all the girls get the guys on the floor.
From the front to the back let's go, hear this. Woo!
