Men At Large- So Alone

We were together just the other day
Taking life for granted, passing time away
I was there for you, you were there for me
We would be together for eternity
I never knew there'll be sorrow
But I knew we'd be together tomorrow
Together forever we were so wrong
Now, I just can't believe that you're gone

And I'm so alone, alone
You never miss a good thing till it's gone
And I'm so alone, I'm so alone yes I am
I really can't believe that you're gone, gone, gone

Life goes on and it's not the same
Cause I can't help sometimes calling out your name
But, then I realize that you won't come around, no
Oh, what I wouldn't give to see your smile
Oh, yes, we've had our ups and downs
Oh, what I wouldn't do to have you cussing me out
I know it sounds funny, but what can I say
My life just ain't the same since you went away

And I'm so alone, alone
I miss you
