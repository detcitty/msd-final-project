Grove, Grove St., Flocka

I gotta a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottle keep popping that's why the bad hoes jockeying
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Rolled up a lot, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

I step in the club, rolling on that loud shit
My weed keep your security saying, "Be quiet"
My breath is starting a riot, the girl's get excited
Hold on, wanna try it, I'm like, why not try it?

My swag they wanna buy it, my juice they wanna try it
Club going stupid when I, "Oh, let's do it"
Chu ain't gotta chew it, jerking and she moving
Grove St. villain, nigga, who you killing?

Broke two years ago, now I'm worth a million
Jacksons to the ceiling, that's how we balling
You know that I'm rolling, throwing up mean bread
