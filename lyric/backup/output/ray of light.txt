Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of morning
Sink beneath the sun
She's got herself a universe, gone quickly
For the call of thunder
Threatens everyone

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light, she's flying
Trying to remember
