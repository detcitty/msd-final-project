Now in my younger days I used to sport as sag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag,
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss.
Always got mad when the class was dismissed,
But when it was in session, I always had a question.
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much,
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug.
She was married to the man. He was a thug, his name was Lee, he drove a Z,
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock.
I was on her jock, yes indeedy. I wrote graffiti on the bus.
First I'd write her name then carve a plus,
With my name last, on the looking glass,
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass.

She keeps on passing me by...
When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly.
