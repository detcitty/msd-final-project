I don't need no one to tell me
how to feel the beat
and i don't need no beat to tell me
how to move my feet
just go and do what you do
'cause theres nothing to prove
(I'm just being me)
(Watch me do me)
I don't need no magazine to tell me
who to be
and I don't need to pose for p-p-parazzi
just keep the camera flashin
to try to catch this action
I'm just being me
Watch me do me
me, me, me
Light up the floor
Play me one more
Let me hear that
Click clack on the high high
Heat of this vibrate
