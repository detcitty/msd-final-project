You got me runnin' goin' out of my mind,
You got me thinkin' that I'm wastin' my time.
Don't bring me down.
No, no, no, no, no.
Whoo-ee-ooh!
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

You wanna stay out with your fancy friends.
I'm tellin' you it's got to be the end,
Don't bring me down
No, no, no, no, no.
Whoo-ee-ooh!
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.
