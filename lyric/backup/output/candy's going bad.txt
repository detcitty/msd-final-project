Candy took the pearls, got ahead of the girls
Got on top and found the secret entrance
Are you satisfied?

Through neon doors, 'cross killing floors
She got sucked into a champagne desert
Are you satisfied?

Daddy said, "I'll break your bones
If you come home dressed in peacock clothes"
Mother said, "Quit the show"
She didn't want the neighbors to know
