(Toby Keith, Dean Dillon, Scott Emerick)

It's a little too late, I'm a little too gone;
A little too tired of this hangin' on:
So I'm lettin' go while I'm still strong enough to.
It's got a little too sad, I'm a little too blue;
It's a little too bad you were too good to be true.
I'm big-time over you baby: it's a little too late.
