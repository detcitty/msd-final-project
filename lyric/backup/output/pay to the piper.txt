If you dance to the music, don't you know
you've got to pay to the piper
ask your mama!
if you dance to the music, don't you know
you've got to pay to the piper
I spend my money on you--every dime
you even told me you had a good time
the night is through and we're all alone
you said it's time that you went home
you've been wined and dined in front of me
just how nice must i be?
