Girl I've never seen you in this town
If you need somebody to show you around, well
(haha) I know somebody
It's a little too loud to talk in here
And your eyes are sayin' you wanna disappear, well
I know a place and I know somebody
Somebody with a gassed up truck sittin' right outside
It's ready to roll if you're ready to ride
Sunroof open with the moonlit sky
Yeah, I know a guy
I know somebody that's lost all in your smile
That can love you like a song on the radio dial
