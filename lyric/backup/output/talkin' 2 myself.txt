Ayo, before I start this song man
I just wanna, thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
and everything I've come from

Can anybody hear me?

Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy

yeah
woah woah waoh
woah woah woah

So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one

I went away I guess and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was going through,
growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne

It's like I was jealous of him cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' And I wasn't
anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God it

Feels like I'm going psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me,
and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, popping another pill, tryna talk myself into it

Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
'specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even?
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying
You're denying your health is declining with your self-esteem
