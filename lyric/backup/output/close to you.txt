I know why birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by
Just like me, ooh
They long to be close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And they decided to
Create a dream come true
