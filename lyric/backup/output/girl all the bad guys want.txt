8 o'clock, Monday night and I'm waitin'
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring
She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means

And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
She doesn't notice me
Cause she is watchin' wrestling
Creamin' over tough guys
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
It's like a bad movie

She is lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be

Screamin' someone shoot me
As I fail miserably
Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want
She's the girl all the bad guys want
