She don't care
About my car
And she don't care
About my money
And that's real good
'cause I don't got
A lot to spend
But if I did
It wouldn't mean nothin'

She likes me for me
Not because I
Look like Tyson Beckford
With the charm
Of Robert Redford
Oozing out my ears
But what she sees
Are my faults
And indecisions
My insecure conditions
And the tears upon
The pillow that I shed

She don't care
About my big screen
