That girl, she's a party, all nighter
Little Funky Cold Medina
Little Strawberry Winer
That girl, she's a love gun slinger
Neon Yager bomb country-okee singer
That girl, she's the walk on the wild side
She's the day glow, radio slow ride
Low ride, good time
If you see her, tell her I'm

Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Hard to find
Got me spending every night
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl

Sundown Heaven Town
Drivin' 'round, hittin' the bars
Shootin' the stars
Rollin' up on every party
Wonderin' where you are
Lookin' for that girl, that girl, that girl
Driving me crazy
Something says, baby, yeah
