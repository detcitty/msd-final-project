Everything is wonderful
Being here is heavenly
Every single day she sends
Everything is free
I used to be so careless
As if I couldn't care less
Did I have to make this mess
When I was Mary's prayer?
Suddenly the Heavens roared
Suddenly the rain came down
Suddenly was washed away
The Mary that I knew
So when you find somebody you keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake
When I was Mary's prayer
