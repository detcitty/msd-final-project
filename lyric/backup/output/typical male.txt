Tell me lawyer what to do
I think I'm falling in love with you
Defend me from the way I feel

Won't you give me some advice
On how to handle my private life
I'm sure we can make a deal

I confess I'm a fool for men
With a clever mind
But your intellect ain't no match
For this heart of mine

All I want is a little reaction
Just enough to tip the scales
