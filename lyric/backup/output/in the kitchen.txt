Girl you're in the kitchen, cookin' me a meal
Somethin' makes me wanna come in there and get a feel
Walk around in your t-shirt with nothin' else on
Struttin' pass, switchin' that ass while I'm on the phone
Cuttin' up tomatoes, fruits and vegetables and potatoes
Girl, you look so sexy while you're doin' the damn thing

I want sex in the kitchen over by the stove
I want put you on the counter by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be makin' love like the restaurant was closed

Would you like that?
Tell me right now pretty, babe
