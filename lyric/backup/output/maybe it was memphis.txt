Lookin' at you through a misty moonlight 
Katydid sing like a symphony 
Porch swing swayin' like a Tennessee lullaby 
Melody blowing through the willow tree 

What was I supposed to do 
Standin' there lookin' at you 
A lonely boy far from home 
Maybe it was Memphis 
Maybe it was southern summer nights 
Maybe it was you maybe it was me 
But it sure felt right 

Read about you in a Faulkner novel 
Met you once in a Williams play
