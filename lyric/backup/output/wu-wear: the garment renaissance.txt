Method Man

Ain't what you want baby
It's what you need baby
Ain't what you want baby
It's what you neeeeeeeed

One: RZA

Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles
nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my physical
Insulated thermal while others drain they co four butt solos
Photographic photo type static great motivated soldier
Or Wu say boulder head flower
You can detect the true and living God from the scorer
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and polysorbate
And drug rate concentrate, with sodium benzoate
By the chicken thighs and tryglycerides
And this bitch advertised her breast size
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up his eyes
Then he became highly civilized
and spent time amongst the wise, went through a garment renaissance
and stopped wearing Benetton
