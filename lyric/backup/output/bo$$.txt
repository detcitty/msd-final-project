Everyday is pay day
Swipe my card, then I do the nae nae
You're talking to a lady
I want a Kanye-ye not a Ray J
So that's a no no
I'm a Maybach and you's a Volvo
This convo beat like Dre-e
I already know whatchu tryna say

You say that you a baller
And I see you tryna holla
But that ain't how I was brought up
Next
Working for my money
Cuz that's what my momma taught me
So yo ass better show me some respect

Boss... Michelle Obama
Purse so heavy gettin' Oprah dollas
Boss... Michelle Obama
