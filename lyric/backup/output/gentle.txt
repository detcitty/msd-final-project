Girl, I promise
I'll be gentle

Sometimes at night
I call your name
And I catch myself falling
Where there is love
Sometimes there's pain

Soon my love is falling
So, please be gentle
Please be gentle
When you're loving me

I'll be gentle, yeah

I'm in a daze
I'm so confused
Since you have
Stopped running
