Show me your company, come and tell me who you'll be
I'll try and take things easy, I'll be loose, I'll be caee
I'm living for tomorrow not today, gotta make my plans so in case
I'll be prepared when I see you smiling

'Cause I feel so high away, I'm reaching out for your sky
I've boundless energies, I feel I could run a million miles
I'm riding on the wheel of fortune, taking me to places far and free
I feel so high when I approach your sky
