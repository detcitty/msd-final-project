If you're ever feelin' low, 
One more minute, 
You're gonna fall in it.

If you're ever feelin' low, 
One more minute, 
You're gonna fall in it.

If you've never been in love before... 
If you've never been in love before... 
Let each second be a memory, 
Let each minute join in harmony.

I'm gonna open up your life, 
I'm gonna take you by surprise.
Oh, don't you be afraid.

Boy, we've got it made.
All we got to do, 
Is do the things we?

But you've never been in love, 
One more minute, 
You're gonna fall in it.
