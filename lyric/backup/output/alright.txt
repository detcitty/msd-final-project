Right, right, right
Sho-be-doop-do-wah
Baby, baby
Sure 'nough, it's alright with me
Right, right
Sure 'nough, alright with me
Seeing that your love's true
Never I'll doubt you
My heart belongs to you, that's
Alright with me
World could end around me
So in love that I can't see
You and me were meant to be, that's
Alright with me
Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
You're alright with me
Through thick and thick to thin
I'll love you till the end
You know it's true my friend
You're alright with me
Friends come and friends may go
My friend, you're real I know
True self you have shown
