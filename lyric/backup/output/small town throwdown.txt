Aw son

Around these parts ain't much to do
Except work like a dog 'til Friday
Punch that clock, cash that check
Raise a little hell 'til Sunday
'Bout that time

There's a party back in the woods tonight
Heard it through the redneck grapevine
Got a keg of beer and a bunch of girls,
Sure enough gonna be a good time
