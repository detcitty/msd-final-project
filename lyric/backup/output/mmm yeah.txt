Austin M keep doing your thing
Let these boys keep slipping man
I'm not into gymnastics but I'm into flipping things

I told these women that it's all about a team
Jordan and Pippen man
So do you wanna join the team
Now tell me little miss thang
Dalé!

When I saw her
Walking down the street
She looked so fine
I just had to speak

I ask her name
But she turned away
As she walked
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was

Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
Mmm mmm yeah yeah
All that I can say was

Rock'n'Roll one time, we'll make it up as we go
I know you feel it cause I mean what I say say say say
We can do whatever, do whatever we want
When she walks past me I say hey, hey, hey…

So tell me where you're from, where you wanna go
But she walk pass me like I ain't said a word
Stood there like man
