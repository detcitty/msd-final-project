Hey

Tick tock, I'm on the clock and I'm feeling like
This job's just 9 to 5'in my life away
It's like I'm back in school and I'm in the last class
And I'm passing time until the bell ring
Havin' visions of summertime
Wait a minute now, that's just later tonight
Tan legs and tailgating, it's all up in the moonlight
And by the way, loosin' up its pay day

Live it up for the weekend
Pour it up, have the time of your life
Take a shot for the regrets
