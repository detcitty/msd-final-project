When's the last time you really touched someone
How did it feel
Did it surprise you when you found yourself unselfish
Did it seem unreal
The pressure's everywhere - everywhere around you
Beckon you to turn the other way
But I say the results are superficial
There's only one way to play

Give-when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

Give - when you have anything at all to give
You have everything to live for
(Give all you've got to give)
After you've given all you can
Give again, give again, give again

Put your head where your feet are going
'Cause the good outweighs the bad
It's you that should be - you should be knowing
It's for what you give not what you have
When it seems you - you can't give enough
Realize it's the good you do it for
So when the going gets a little bit tough
