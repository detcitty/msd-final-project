When I think of those east end lights
Muggy nights the curtains drawn
In the little room downstairs
Prima donna Lord you really should have been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there rolling 'round the basement floor
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...)

And someone saved my life tonight
Sugar bear (sugar bear...)

You almost had your hooks in me
Didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar bound hypnotized sweet freedom
Whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away
High away
Bye bye
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...)

Never realized the passing hours of evening showers
Slip noose hanging in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
