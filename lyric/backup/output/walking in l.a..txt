Look ahead as we pass, try and focus on it
i won't be fooled by a cheap cinematic trick
it must have been just a cardboard cut out of a man
top forty cast off from a record stand
Walkin' in la
walkin' in la, nobody walks in la
walkin' in la
walkin' in la, nobody walks in la
I don't know could've been a lame jogger maybe
or someone just about to do the freeway strangler baby
shopping cart pusher or maybe someone groovy
one thing's for sure, he isn't starring in the movies
'cause he's walkin' in la
