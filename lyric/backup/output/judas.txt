Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Gaga
Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Gaga

When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me

Ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh, ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
Ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh, ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh
A king with no crown, king with no crown

I'm just a holy fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
