1, 2, 3, 4
Yeah (uh huh)
Polo the Don
Listen girl Mario Let’s go
Ladies

It’s like you caught up in a maze
You keep on going in circles girl you’re trying to find your way out
But its time I put on my cape and
Put that s on my chest
Girl I wanna come and save you

But I’m stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt
I know when you love him
And you wanna make it work
And I can’t help but think that I knew you first
It’s getting louder
Can’t ignore it no more

I can hear your heart crying out for me (crying out for me)
