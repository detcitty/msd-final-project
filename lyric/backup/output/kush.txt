Roll up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Roll up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it

Roll up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Roll up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it

Now it's that puff, puff, pass shit, Cheech and Chong grass shit
Blunts to the head, kush pillows, no mattress
Speed boat traffic, bitches automatic
Cross that line, fuck around, and get yo' ass kicked
We roll shit that burn slow as fucking molasses
Probably won't pass it, smoke it 'til the last hit
Down to the ashes, Mary J. a bad bitch
Andre 3001, another classic
Go ahead ask him bitches
'Bout how I be smokin' out, party all night, oh yeah, it's goin' down
Order rounds, we smoke a quarter pound of that good stuff
Oh yeah, we smokin' all night
Yeah, puff, puff, pass that shit right here, nigga
better than my last batch
