I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day

Ever since I was a tiny boy
I don't want no candy
I don't need no toy
I took a stick and an old coffee can
I bang on that thing til I got
Blisters on my hand because

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day
Yes, I do
I don't want to play
I just want to bang on the drum all day
That's right
