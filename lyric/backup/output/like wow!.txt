Everything looks bright
Standing in your light
Everything feels right
One step is all outta sight
What's a girl to do
When I feel that you
You're on my mind
I wanna be with you
'Cause when you're
Standing next to me
It's like, wow
Now your kisses
They may set me free
It's like, wow
And when you touch
It's such a rush
I can't get enough
It's like, it's like

Ooh, hey, why
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, why
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, why
It's like wow
Ooh, hey, why
It's like wow

Should I hesitate
When I feel this great
Don't wanna make
A big mistake
Don't wanna make
A thing of playing games
I'm just trying to say
