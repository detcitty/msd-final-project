Oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Bass!

It's quarter to two,
and i've still got you on my mind, oh baby.
i'm just a prisoner,
trapped in the chains of your love.
it cuts like a knife, imagining life without you,
oh darling.
i'm up to the challenge, and i'm willing to fight.
i'd do anything to have you with me tonight...
oh baby...
I'd swim a river if the river was wide,
i'd climb a mountain if the mountain was high.
