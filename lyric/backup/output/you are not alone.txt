Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said good-bye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone

I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone

I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
