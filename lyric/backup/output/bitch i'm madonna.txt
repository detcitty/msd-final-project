Ooooooooooh
Ooooooooooh
(You're gonna love this)
Ooooooooooh
(You can't touch this)
Ooooooooooh
(Cuz I'm a bad bitch)
We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah, we'll be drinking and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us

I just wanna have fun tonight (love this shit tonight)
Put me under the flashing light
Ohhhhh, let me blow up this house tonight

(Gonna blow up!)

We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na nana na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna

(Bitch bitch, I'm Madonna)
(Bitch bitch, I'm Madonna)

We're jumping in the pool and swimmin' with our clothes on
I poured a beer into my shoe and got my freak on
The neighbor's pissed and says he's gonna call the Five-O
