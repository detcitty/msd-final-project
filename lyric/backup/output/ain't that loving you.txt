Before you think I love you
For just one thing
To you, my love, this might
Be the way that it seems

But I love the way
That you carry yourself
I even love the way
You wear your hair

Ain't that loving you
Ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one

Somehow, our love
Has been misled
By a lot of things
That the other men said
