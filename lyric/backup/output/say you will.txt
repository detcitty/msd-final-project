Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you don't
Wanna be mine

Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind this time
Say you will, say you will
Be mine tonight

I can't sleep, I keep dreaming I'm losing you
Feel so alone in the night, scared to open my eyes
I'm in too deep, I'm in over my head this time
Can't get you out of my mind no matter how hard I try
So won't you

Say you will, say you won't
Make up your mind tonight
Say you do, say you won't
Be my guiding light
