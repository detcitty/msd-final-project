You know my old car needs washing
And the front yard needs a trim
And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know its him
And the bills ain't gonna pay themselves
No matter anyway
Cause I ain't in no hurry today

There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair
