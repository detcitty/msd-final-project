When you have no light to guide you
And no one to walk beside you
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you
When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you

Oh I will come to you
Sometimes when all your dreams may have seen better days
When you don't know how or why, but you've lost your way
Have no fear when your tears are fallin'

I will hear your spirit callin'
And I swear that I'll be there come with me
When you have no light to guide you
