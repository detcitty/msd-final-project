Call me good, call me bad
Call me anything you want to baby
But I know, that you're sad
And I know I'll make you happy with the one thing that you never had

Baby I'm your man (Don't you know that?)
Baby I'm your man (You bet)
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me

So good, you're divine
Wanna take you, wanna make you
But they tell me it's a crime
Oh, everybody knows where the good people go
But where we're going baby, ain't no such word as no

Baby, I'm your man (Don't you know who I am?)
Baby, I'm your man (You know, you bet)
If you're gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me (uh-huh baby)
