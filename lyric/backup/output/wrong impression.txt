Calling out, calling out
Haven't you wondered
Why I'm always alone
When you're in my dreams?
Calling out, calling out
Haven't you wondered
Why you're finding it hard
just looking at me?

I want you, but I want you to understand
I need you, I love you

Didn't want to leave you with the wrong impression
Didn't want to leave you with my last confession, yeah
Of love
Wasn't trying to pull you in the wrong direction
All I want to do is try to make a connection, yeah
Of love, yeah
