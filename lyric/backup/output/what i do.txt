oJust in case you forgot
We gon' runner run it
Hold up

Chris Brown, this what we do, we do this
I be throwin' up my cash
Actin' like money ain't a thang, yeah
I'm speedin' down this fast lane
I'm stuntin' and they mad 'cause they can't, yeah
I'm feelin' like I can't lose

And when they ask me 'bout the cars, and the girls, and the cribs
I just tell 'em it's what I do, it's what I do
It's what I do, hey, it's what I do
Everywhere I go, they show me love, so I give it back

Throw a couple stacks up in the air 'cause I'ma get it back
See somethin' sexy up in here, I'ma bring it back
They keep on runnin' back, they keep on comin' back

Everybody knows me when they see me, sittin' in the front row, playa
Stuntin' with my shades on, and it's all for them haters, yeah
We get into that crunk, boy
Her money too long boy, we do this for fun, boy
