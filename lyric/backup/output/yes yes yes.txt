Right on, baby
Let me ask you a question, darling
Last night, I had thirty-five
Dollars in my pocket

Did you go through my pockets
(Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...)
Right on, right on
That's what I thought happened

(Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...)
I'm gonna ask you another question, baby

My car, you borrowed my car, didn't you
Did you bash the side in, baby
With the light hanging out
And the wheel falling off

(Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...)
Right on, right on, right on
(Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...)
