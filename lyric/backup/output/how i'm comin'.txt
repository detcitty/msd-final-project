Boom bash, wake up, I set it off right
Look around and turn your wet dream to fright night
You can call me r&b homeys, which stands for rough brother
Word to my grandmother
I buck you in the head just to let ya know
Stick you for ya dough, spit on the flo'
Drag it out of ya, bring it on
I smack him back down, yo dope word is bond
I know you want a piece of the champ
But you roll too weak, you couldn't make it in my camp
You thought I went for the flip
But I'm bustin' off hip-hop clip after clip
I kept you out there, ripped you for your wear
Jump inside your video, bust you with a chair
Smack slap smack slap smack slap smack
Just to make it worse and hurt your pride I'll run it back
Smack slap smack slap smack slap smack
Click click boom, stop dead in your tracks
Stick the steel in your mouth
Buck buck buck buck buck, lights out

[chorus]
(I'm comin')
How ya comin' baby?
(I'm comin')
This is how I'm comin'

The album that I'm comin' with is rough, the flavor's mean
