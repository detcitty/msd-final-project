Great
Fake plastic Mistletoe
Wrap me in a great big bow
And tear me apart

It's Christmas time
So open up the flood gates
Tell me that you'll be late
And rip me apart

Cause you say that, you say that things will be alright
But I've heard that, I've heard that so many times and I know that

It's not Christmas if the snow don't fall
And I'm still standing here 3 feet small
