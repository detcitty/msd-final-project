Mother, mother, tell your children
That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won

Father, father, please believe me
I am laying down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me
Forgive your wayward son

(Everybody needs somebody to love) Mother, mother
(Everybody needs somebody to hate) Please believe me
(Everybody's bitching 'cause they don't get enough)
And it's hard to hold on
When there's no one to lean on

(Faith!) You know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord, we've got to keep the faith
(Faith!) Don't you let your love turn to hate
Now we've got to keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord, we've got to keep the faith
