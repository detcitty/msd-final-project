I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away.
Mildewed and smouldering,
Fundamental differing.
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication.
The light that feuled our fire then
Has a burned a hole between us so
We cannot see to reach an end
Crippling our communication.
