Never too busy
I'm never too busy for you, babe
Never too busy, no

I've got things on my mind
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy
If you're feeling alone
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy

Girl, when we first started
We were spending all our time together in love
Now we're growing on
And you're afraid of losing me, don't be

I've got a heart full of love even though I might not show it
Girl it's you I dream of and just so you know it
You have my attention, anything you need at all
I'll be there when you call me
