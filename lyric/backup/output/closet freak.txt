Yeah. ooh.
You so freaky.
You so freaky shorty.
Ooh you so freaky.
Shit, you so freaky shorty.
Uh uh, you so freaky.
Ooh Lord, you so freaky.
Mmm uh, you so freaky shorty.
HAH HAH!!

Now everybody that's grown got skeleton bones they got hidden away
Yes y'all there's a freak in us all, yet some choose not to say
You can't let those who ain't yet, make you they lil' ball of clay
Be free and express yourself, nastiness comes naturally
Listen to me now
It could be the way I wanna freak a song, tattoos, or the way I dress
Or it could be; I wanna walk my way and refusin to follow the rest
Or when people haven't been where you been
and they say you still going too far
Or when you wit ya girl and
Pull over and fuck somethin in the back of the car
