I felt the closing walls
Trouble on the rise
You didn't have to say a word
I saw it in your eyes

Opened up my soul
I showed a view inside
I'm not too proud
To say out loud
I'm happier, I cried

A shield of misty gray
We'll gladly leave behind
A restless youth
Gave way to truth
And now to peace of mind

We'll ride the wings of love
A maze of tears have gone
