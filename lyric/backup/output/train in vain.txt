You say you stand by your man
Tell me something, I don't understand
You said you loved me and that's a fact

And then you left me, said you felt trapped
Well some things you can't explain away
But my heartache's in me till this day
You didn't stand by me

No, not at all
You didn't stand by me

No way
All the times, when we were close
I'll remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumbling down
