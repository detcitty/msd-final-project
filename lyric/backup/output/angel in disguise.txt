(Brandy Talking)
An angel has always been thought to be one of gods most perious works.
I guess that's how she had you fooled cause she was an angel in disguise.
Hurt and pain can never come from her so you felt me to find
that hust and pain involves her but now you see your mistakes.
And know you see your angel was a fake but my love was never misplaced.
So baby my love is true and most importantly, still I love you.

(Still I love you...)  

Chorus (Times 2) -
angel in disguise she was
But somehow you fell for her
Until she broke your heart that day
And left you in the rain
But still I love you

I found it quite strange
The way you said her name
And when you look in her eyes
I see the lust you can't deny
It's more to this then what you say
Cause in your sleep you called her name
You say she's just a friend
I knew right then cause the rain began

Chorus (times 2) -
angel in disguise she was
