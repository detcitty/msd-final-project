You see I been waiting
Waiting on that time
Feel me if you been waiting on yours
That moment...
Is close

Tired of living day to day like everything is alright
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin' syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don't let 'em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin' for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
I wonder when the Braves gon' win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon' get here
Pyrex vison, made more than I ever made with DTP this year

Tired of livin' day to day like everything is alright
