What's your name, cause I'm impressed
Can you treat me good, I won't settle for less
You a hot boy, a rock boy
A fun toy, tote a glock boy
Where you live, is it by yourself
Can I move wit' you, do you need some help
I cook boy, I'll give you more
I'mma fly girl, and I like those

Hot boyz
Baby you got what I want
See cuz y'all be drivin' Lexus jeeps
And the Benz jeeps, and the Lincoln jeeps
Nothin' cheaper, got them Platinum Visa's

Hot boyz
Baby you got what I want
See cuz y'all be drivin' Jaguars
And the Bentley's, and the Rolls Royce
Playin' hardballs wit' them Platinum Visa's

Is that your car, the SK-8
