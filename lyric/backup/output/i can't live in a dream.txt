The day that you moved away, 
Life was so empty.
All I had left, 
Was your memory.

Memory, memory.

Livin', it seems, 
What was left, 
Was a dream.
A dream of the way, 
It used to be.

But I can't live a dream, 
Anymore than I can live forever.
Anymore than I can climb a mountain, 
To the sun.
To the sun...
