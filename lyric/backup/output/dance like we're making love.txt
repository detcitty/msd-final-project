Sweat dripping from my body, we both at this party,
So come and show me your moves, I got some things I can teach you too
If you wanna see, oh oh
You say you need a shot of the Henee
Then you're ready
Do what you need to do
Cause I'll be waiting for you
It's about to get hot and heavy, oh oh

It's really late
You're getting closer and the lights off
Your body is in sync to the beat of my heart
And I can feel your nature rising wild and wild on you

Let's dance like we're making love
Making love
