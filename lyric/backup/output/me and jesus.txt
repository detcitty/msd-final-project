Well, me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
Me and Jesus got it all worked out
Me and Jesus got our own thing goin'
We don't need anybody to tell us what it's all about

I know a man who once was a sinner
I know a man that once was a drunk
I know a man who once was a looser
But he went out one day and made an alter out of a stump
