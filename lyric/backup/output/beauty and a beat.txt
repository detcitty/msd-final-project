Yeah, Young Money, Nicki Minaj, Justin

...
Show you off, tonight I wanna show you off
...
What you got, a billion could've never bought
...
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I want to show you all the finer things in life

So just forget about the world, be young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya
Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
...
Who can make my life complete
...

It's all 'bout you, when the music makes you move
...
