I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critics saying: "Is it right, or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an I.V., baby, could I bear?
Being away from you, I found the vein, put it in here

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

Make it real loud (A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E)
