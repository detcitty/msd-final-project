When I look in your eyes, I see a reflection of me
Being there for you whenever you need me, yeah
I can't describe my soul feelin' so deep
For you girl it's like a dream come true
You are my everything

I won't never leave you, or desert you
I won't risk the good things that we have in life, oh girl
It's important to me, for you to trust me, baby
'Cause I'm givin' my all and all to you right now
Just right, tonight, I wanna love you down

I'll never ever leave you alone and confused
That's one thing that you'll never have to think twice about, baby
Don't mind kickin' it with you, kickin' it with you
But lately I've been thinkin' you're the only one that's right for me
Just right, tonight, I wanna love you down, girl

You're my girl, and I can't see myself
Givin' you to somebody else, it's so impossible
