They were farm kids way down in Dixie
Met in high school in the sixties
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July, in the midnight hour
He climbed upon the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said that he should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green
