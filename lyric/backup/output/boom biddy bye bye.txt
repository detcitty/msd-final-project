Refugee camp, with Cypress Hill
Yo, bringin' it on Cubans meet the Haitians
Perfect combination, check it

You say guns, I say pistolas
Well, if you got beef son
Callate la boca
Go meet me on the island where the Cubans meet the Haitians
A bullet beats the verbal lyrical assassination
From L A to Brooklyn why you doin' all that talkin'

Think you got a soul but you're a dead man walking
Yo, toast the host from coasts' we boast
When we meet again, I will be Casper that friendly ghost
You'll hear shots, like the Show Cops
Things are still the same, I'm still growin' crops
Wyclef with B Real, let me build better yet, killa bee kill
Yo, B Real watch your grip

Hi, boom biddy, bye, bye
Yo, open up your eyes you'll be the next one to die
Boom biddy, bye, bye
Oh, as simple as they come as the simple as they die
Boom biddy, bye, bye
