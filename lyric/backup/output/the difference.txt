Sonny Rollin' Grams of Wax

You got a bag and I got a bag but they know the difference
If you talking cash and I'm talking cash but they know the difference (Cash, cash)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
You got a Wraith and I got a Wraith
But they know the difference (Cash)
Bought the machine in 2016 so they know the difference
The diamonds is shinin' the rollie is clean so they know the difference
They know the difference (They know the difference)
They know the difference (They know the difference)
Your bitches is bad, and my bitches bad but we know the difference

In the trenches gettin' back at it
With the haters and the backstabbers
Head huntin' for a rat rapper
Head huntin' for a wack rapper
I ain't really with the back and forth and nigga, I'mma send a hundred stacks at em
Nigga probably send the rats at em
Ninja turtle with a rat master
