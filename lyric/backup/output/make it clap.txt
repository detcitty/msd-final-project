[Busta Rhymes:]
Just make it clap
Just make it clap
Ay yo we 'bout to take everybody from every street
And throw a party in the Grand Canyon, come on!

Ah ha, yeah yeah, uh ah uh,
See, Ya'll know, what it is...
yeah yeah, ah, ah, ah
Flipmode baby, check it

Hey! Hey! Ain't no fakin the fluid
Water drippin off asses of women that's shakin it to it
While I'm takin you through it, no mistakin my crew is
Flipmode baby! got you actin all stupid
Now I'm back in the cupid, just to tell you the truth is
Them niggas that be havin you blacken and ready to lose it
Pushin lambos and harley rockin Roberto Cavalli (Huh!)
Now I got a new hobby diamonds and tattoos and bodies
Watch me crash through the party, go 'head and spaz girl
Tatooin the name of my click across yo' ass girl
We 'bout to blast girl, from here to Albuquerque
Like jamaican niggas rockin big chains in socker jerseys
Take you on hotter journeys, the way we put it down
And be hittin be havin you shittin more than a box of hersheys
We come to control it we come to command it
And just for the record we always come to set a new standard
Act like you know

In case you ain't know and in case you ain't heard
