Movin' to the country gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country gonna eat a lot of peaches

Peaches come from a can
They were put there by a man
In a factory downtown

If I had my little way
I'd eat peaches every day
