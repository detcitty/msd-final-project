I'm mixing up a bunch of magic stuff
A magic mushroom cloud of care
A potion that'll rock, the boat will rock
And make a bomb of love and blow it up

I did it
Do you think I've gone too far?
I did it
Guilty as charged
I did it
It was me right or wrong
I did it
Yeah

I never did a single thing that did a single thing
To change the ugly ways of the world
I didn't know it felt so right inside
I didn't know at all
I opened up the curtains
I heard sirens there, the lights flash and crawl
But I did it justice
I just did it for the buzz, oh

It's a nickel or a dime for what I've done
The truth is that I don't really care
For such a lovely crime I'll do the time
You better lock me up I'll do it again
