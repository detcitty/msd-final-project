Every time I look at you
I don't understand
Why you let the things you did
Get so out of hand
You'd have managed better
If you'd had it planned
Now why'd you choose such a backward time
And such a strange land?

If you'd come today
You could have reached the whole nation
Israel in 4 B.C. had no mass communication

Don't you get me wrong (Don't you get me wrong)
Don't you get me wrong (Don't you get me wrong)
Don't you get me wrong (Don't you get me wrong)
Don't you get me wrong (Don't you get me wrong)
