Baby, show me what you feel
Come on to me, show me somethin' real
I need to know, I need you completely
Closer baby closer, come on closer baby (Let it begin)
Our love is takin' over, got to let it in

Ooh, I need to feel the heart of you
I need to reach the very deepest part of you

Can I touch you there, touch you deep inside?
Can I touch your heart, the way you're touchin' mine?
Can I touch you there, touch you deep within, oh?
