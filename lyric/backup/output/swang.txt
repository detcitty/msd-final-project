Um, it's nasty
Uh, it's nasty
Uhmm
Know some young niggas like to swang, uhmm
Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang

Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take little bank
Everday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave
