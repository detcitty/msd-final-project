It was noon time, down time, break time, summer time
Miller time, anytime, she was lookin' pretty fine
A red light, green light, go all fired upside downtown
She was shakin' me all 'round
I was tuned in, goin' nowhere, second wind
Jonesin', droolin', feelin' good, if you would

Oh yeah, by the way she moves
She's got me rollin' in dirt in a white t-shirt
Breaker breaker one to nine she's a big ol' flirt
By now she's got me pretty tied up
Tied down, anyway I choose
I've got nothin' to lose
