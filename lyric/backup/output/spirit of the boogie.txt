Get up, let's boogie all
The boogie's back again
For the boogie there is no beginning
And there is no end, ha

Come on, feel the funk, y'all, get up
Come on, feel the spirit, spirit of the boogie
Come on, feel it, get [Incomprehensible]
Come on, pop your fingers

It's the boogie, y'all
Get down, got to feel it
The spirit of the boogie
That's right, come on now

Get up, just feel the spirit of the boogie
Check it out, just let it flow
'Cause when the boogie come to get you
