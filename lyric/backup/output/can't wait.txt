(Verse One)
I'm like RRRAHHH RRRAHHHH, like I had cerebral palsy
My flows be's wet like all you girls drawers be
Crack the Phils, spread the buddha then the hidash
Roll it up and then ask, who chipped in for the ten bag?
Et cetera, I roll my blunts with two textures
Pick up fifty bags and then I smoke all the extras
It's the truth, like vod-ka one-eighty proof
Don't drop your drawers, I'll fuck through your daisy dukes (true!)
Put your fingers up in the air if you're high (hiiigh)
I walk by (byyyy) so eff a drive (dryyyy)
i swing up in it bout an average as half as
good as Reggie Jackson's that's why you talk backwards
Enough; chumps be on some Bogart shit like Humphrey
You couldn't beat me if you ran with 21 Jump Streets
Or 90210, fuck it yo
In the movies I'm the nigga puffin buddha in the back row

(Chorus: Repeat 8X)
