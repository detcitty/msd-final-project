I know you've seen all your dreams turn to dust
I know your heart's been left in the rain to rust
But you wont be lonely now.
I see a long trail of tears in your eyes
Back to the day when the innocense died
But you wont be lonely now.

I wanna give you everything you need
I wanna show you
You wont be lonely
