I used to be now I'm not what you see, Lord I try
And now it seems all those dreams have come true, but they're passing me by
Some fast talkin' mama for a dollar put a smile on my face
I'm drivin' all night
I end up in the same old place

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright

And who's to care if I grow my hair to the sky
