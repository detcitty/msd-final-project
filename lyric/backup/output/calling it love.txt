I lay here beside you, just thinkin’ all night
I believe that tomorrow would make things all right
I still tell you i love you, that you’re forever mine
It makes you feel good and it buys me some time
If i told i needed you
But i sent you away
I’ve been calling it love
Because i want u to stay
Calling it love
Say you’ll stay
Calling it love
Cause i’m too scared to say
