They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?

No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue

Come and get it, lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye 'cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody looking for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away, can't take it for another minute

This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's only promising
