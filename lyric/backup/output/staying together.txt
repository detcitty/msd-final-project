You can't go boy
We've been over it a hundred times but this one's different
This time I'm not asking what you think
I'm telling you
We're staying together
Whether you like it or not

Here we go!

VERSE 1:
If you thought that I would get up and go
Oh baby got something you should know
I got one thing on my mind
That's staying together
Oh and I'll tell you boy, it just isn't right
I won't say goodbye without a fight
'Cause you and me are staying together

CHORUS:
Don't you say goodbye to me boy
