[[spoken]]
all right now, get your ears lowered down to the speakers
so you can understand what i`m talking about
you know it seems like no matter where we go to play a concert at
there`s one thing that remains constant
from the beginning to the very end of the show
you can always count on about one hundred to five hundred people
down at the very front row screaming one word
at the top of their lungs... boogie!
and sometimes, the feeling prevails upon `em so hard, beloved
but they just have to mount up on the stage
