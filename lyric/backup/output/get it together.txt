You better get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Get up, get up, get up

Get up off your high horse, girl
Think what you're doin', doin'
Get up off your high horse, girl
Think what you're doin', doin'

(Spinnin' around)
I'm spinnin' around
You're merry-go-round
You got me dizzy, dizzy
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy

Get it together
Or leave it alone
