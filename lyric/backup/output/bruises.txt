Haven't seen you since high school
Good to see you're still beautiful
Gravity hasn't started to pull
Quite yet; I bet you're rich as hell
One that's five and one that's three
Been two years since he left me
Good to know that you got free
That town I know was keeping you down
On your knees
These bruises make for better conversation
Loses the vibe that separates
It's good to let you in again
You're not alone in how you've been
Everybody loses
