Freedom, this is what I call freedom

Well, I wanna say, I wanna tell you
I wanna say when you can do what you wanna do
And go where you wanna go
And live where you wanna live
And love who you wanna love

And be what you wanna be
Join what you wanna join
Well, well, well, that's freedom
Yeah, yeah, freedom, yes sir

When you can learn what you wanna learn
And read what you wanna read
 (Free, free, free)

And write what you wanna write
 (Free, free, free)
Do what you feel is right
 (Free, free, free)
