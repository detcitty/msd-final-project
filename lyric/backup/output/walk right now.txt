Here, when all my work is done, babe
She calls and she says
Dear, can I come
I say to her
That you know our love has gone
But agressive heart
No, really not the one
She comes to the door
Crying at my feet
Guilt shines in her eyes
As she slowly sinks in deep

You know our love couldn't last forever
Persuade your way
But you ain't clever
I close the door and I say never

(I don't care)
What you're saying
(Walk right now)
I ain't playing
(Love elsewhere)
For you I'm praying
(Don't look back)
You ain't staying

Here, I'm crying
I can't sleep
I sigh
'Cause I thought this would never be
I say ooh
I'm screaming out for someone
And now she's knochin' on the door for me
