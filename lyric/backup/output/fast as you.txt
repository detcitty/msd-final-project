Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's tough, yeah,
You'll be the one who's got it rough
It won't be long and
Maybe I'll be real strong.

Maybe I'll do things right
Maybe I'll start tonight
You'll learn to cry like me
Baby, let's just wait and see
Maybe I'll start tonight
And do things right.
