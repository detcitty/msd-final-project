Let me just sit down
And relax a minute
Let me tell you about it
Aha, it's Friday
Oh ho, thank God, it's Friday
And I just got paid
Going across town
Gonna pick up my lady
Have a little bit of fun
Just ain't no telling
Where I might end up
You might see me on the east side
Ha, the west side
I'm even going cross the bridge
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I hear
They really get down over there
(Well, well, I)
Owe it to myself
(Well, well, I)
Gonna party
(Well, well, I)
Gonna party
(Well, well, I, well, well, I)
