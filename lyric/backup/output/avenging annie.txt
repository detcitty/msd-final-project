We ran through hills and forests
As two under a spell
He was a city boy, Floyd the outlaw
But I thought I knew him well

Long after that great summer
When I first came into my fame
And the avenger from Oklahoma
Was added to my name
The avenger I became

Well, they call me avenging Annie
I'm avenger of womanhood
I spend my whole life telling lies
Lead you on and mess you over good

I take all you spoiled young hippies
Running around, playing games
Mess around in your bed
I'll blow your head
I'll put you through a change

What you've done to others
I'll do unto you

And then I met my
Sensitive outlaw
He was the best thing
