Oooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey

I notice there's a look
Of doubt in your eye
When you see me talking
To other guys
And I just don't understand why

You must try to understand
That those other guys
Are just my friends
And they all know that
You're my man, oh, oh

I wouldn't lie to you
I would never lie to you
I wouldn't lie to you
You know I'd never lie to you

I wouldn't lie to you
(Get up from being jealous)
I would never lie to you
(Wanna stay your only friend)

I wouldn't lie to you
(Get up from being insecure)
You know I'd never lie to you
