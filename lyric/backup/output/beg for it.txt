I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg

Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby
High price, but I'm worth it, baby
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby
Gettin' faded in the European swervin' name
Look, describe Iggy, ground breaking what the word is
Hit the stage, yeah, shake it like I'm nervous
When in New York got me parking right on Madison
This ain't no accident, I'm killing them on purpose
I-G-G-Y, think she just had to do it better
Ride with me, fly livin', there ain't nothin' to it
Am I waist slim ass fat you gotta have it

Get my bake on, cake long
That's automatic
