This is a state of emergency
What you want me to do
I'm sorry
I'm back
Hey, hey, hey

Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shorty
Show me what you got, baby

Hands up and waves, waves, waves, waves

Give the drummer some
I already gave the summer some
It's the winter's turn
Hovie Hov is the coldest
I'm just getting better with time
I'm like Opus One
Young, no two alike like a snowflake
Okay, Show me what you got baby
Words is slurring, engine purring
Mami front, but I'm so determined
