You see it every day in every way
We all hear the same routines
They all say that it's okay
Just let us take care of everything
So we lay it on the line

Layin' it on the line (Layin' it on the line)
Layin' it all, right on the line
Just layin' it on the line (Layin' it on the line)
Layin' it all, we're livin on the front line
