I said I don't want to walk this earth
If I got to do it solo

See how we used to be a team
Running the streets
Ya we was living out our dream, oh
You used to be my rider
I was your provider
And now we separated in two

Oh we was burning up the block
And everybody know when we step in the spot, oh
See, we was like the dynamic duo
I'd never thought that you'd go, but you did
