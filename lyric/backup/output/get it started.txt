To these rappers I apologize, I know it ain't fair
Only ball I drop, New Year's Times Square
The world is mine, sixth sense, I see a seventh sense
Now baby, let's get started for life

Everytime I look into your eyes
Mr Worldwide
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started

Big news, pitbull, time cruise mumbai
A little bit of semi night like the fourth july, vanilla sky
Thriller in Manila, knocking them out like Paquiao
No Ali for Frasier, but for now it's off to Malaysia
