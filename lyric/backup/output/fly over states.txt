A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk, killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
30, 000 feet above, could be Oklahoma
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man it all looks the same
Miles and miles of backroads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?
