Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Yeah, yeah

We've been down too long
Gotta keep on liftin', liftin', liftin', liftin' you
(High, high, high, high, high)
Gotta keep on liftin', liftin', liftin', liftin' you
(High, high, high, high, high)
Nothing never remains the same

Gotta keep on liftin', liftin', liftin', liftin' you
(High, high, high, high, high)
Gotta keep on
