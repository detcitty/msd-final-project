Callin' all the monsters, callin' all the monsters
Callin' all, callin' all, callin' all the monsters

Oh yea aye, oh yea aye, oh yea aye

Heart thumps and you jump
Comin' down with goosebumps!
You dare to go there
I'ma, I'ma get you so scared!

We're wantin' to
We're hauntin' you
We're wantin' to
Ehh ehh

If you stayed in too late
To be getting afraid
This scene extreme
I, I, I, I'ma get you so scared!

We're wantin' to
We're hauntin' you
We're wantin' to
Ehh ehh

Gonna get your body shakin'
And wishin' you could just awaken
