I'm so serious!

One, two them boys coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, hide your bitch
(Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit)

They said, thou shall not be ill
Thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas high for real
Every year gon be our year
Every year gon be my year
These niggas really is out here
These niggas really is out here
The block is at war
Post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills
Rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over In God's We Trust
We believe in God but do God believe in us
