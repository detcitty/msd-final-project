I can't be that other woman
I can't be that other woman

You only see me every Friday night at nine
Can't imagine what you told her this time
You never take me to a public place
Worried that somebody might notice your face
Rush to the liquor store and then a motel
Call up your friends just to cover you're trail
Not a word until the week goes by
You call me when you want some pie

Why am I crying every night over you
You're never gonna leave her
Finally I woke up and smell the coffee
I understand
Why two women can't share one man

I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad
But she needs you much more

I can't be that other woman
