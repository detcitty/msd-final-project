I dont wanna go there...
We should never go there...(Damn)
Why you wanna go there?
I guess I gotta go there...

You hearing rumors about me
And you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touchin' my body
When your so close to my heart
I won't deny what their sayin'
Because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you

So please babe... (Please)
So please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
Cause it could get ugly
Before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful...
