I asked her to stay
But she wouldn´t listen
She left before I had the chance to say, oh
The words that will mend
the things that were broken
And now it´s far too late, she´s gone away

Every night you cry yourself to sleep
thinking "why does this happen to me?"
"Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe it

It´s not over, tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
