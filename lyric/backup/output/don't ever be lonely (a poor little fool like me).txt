Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me

Oh, I sit down
And I moan sometime
Over a big mistake I made
Didn't take time to love her
And it caused her love to fade

Oh, if you have true love
(If you have true love)
Take a tip from a man in misery

Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
