I wake up in a cold sweat
To a clock that says
It's only 3 A.M.

Thinking that I felt you
When I really only
Dreamed of you again

I'm clinging to your pillow
Like a drowning man
Would hold on as I feel the
Flood of memories rushing in

[CHORUS]
And I flashback
Oh, back to the time
You were mine and we
Lived in a love song
