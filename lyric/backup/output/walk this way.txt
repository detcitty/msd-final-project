Now there's a backseat/lover
That's always under/cover
And I talk til my daddy say
Said you ain't seen/nuthin
Til you're down on her/muffin
And there's sure to be a change in ways
Now there's a cheer/leader
That's a real big/pleaser
As far as I can remi/nisce
But the best thing/love it
Was her sister and her/cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this
