Boys call you sexy
And you don't care what they say
See every time you turn around they scream your name

Boys call you sexy
And you don't care what they say
See every time you turn around they scream your name
Darkchild

Now I've got a confession (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
When I was young I wanted attention (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
And I promised myself that I'd do anything (Ha Ha Ha Ha)

Anything at all for them to notice me (La La La La)
But I ain't complaining (No)
We all wanna be famous (Oh)

So go ahead and say what you wanna say (Oh)
You know what its like to be nameless (Oh)
Want them to know what your name is (Oh)
'Cause see when I was younger I would say

When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies

When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies

When I grow up
Be on T.V.
People know me

Be on magazines
When I grow up
Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene

But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
