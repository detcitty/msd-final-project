You need a love that will not change
You want a lover to remain forever yours
Oh, but you don’t have to worry, you never have to fear
Through thick and thin I’ll always be here

I’ll be your bridge over and through troubled waters
You never have to face it alone
And when the world seems to treat you unfair
Baby, for you I’ll always be there

I won’t be no fairweather friend
I’ll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again

I won’t be no fairweather friend
I’ll be there till the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again

Sometimes I know it’s rough for you
And then there are times you’re hurt and blue, got so much pain
Oh, but I, I’m the kind of person who can take the hurt away
You never have to suffer again

I’ll be your strength to carry you over the mountain
To lift you up when you’re fallin’ down
Baby, be strong, you can believe in me
‘Cause I’m your friend and I’ll always, always, always be right there
