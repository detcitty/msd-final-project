One, Two, Three, Four
Ohh-Ohh-Ohh-Ohh

Play the lotto you might win it
It's like 25 to life so you bust out of prison
Something's in the air
Something's in the air

It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it
Take your last shot you know you're going to hit it
Something's in the air
Something's in the air
Woah Ohh

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling, and its grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like

Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
