Ooh, yeah, ooh
Yeah, oh, yeah

The only ground I ever owned was sticking to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch and this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of glowing sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like that's where it was hung
My blessings are in front of me, it's not about the land
I'll never beat the view from my front porch looking in

There's a carrot top who can barely walk with a sippy cup of milk
