Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise

Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (Heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
