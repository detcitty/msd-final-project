Once I loved someone so deep it hurt to leave his side
He was wonderful, loveable, he was truly just so beautiful
I feel so blessed he came my way

Sugar sweet, my sugar high
The sweetest taste I'll ever try
Your love is one I can't deny
I love you, I love you, I love you

Sugar sweet, I've realized
Just one look into your eyes
Slowly gets me hypnotized
I love you, I love you, I love you

His love was far beyond wealth and gold
So much from one would I learn
He was a delicate morning rain that fell to wash away my pain
And bring me warmth in return

He was magical, mystical, simply irresistible
