The sun was shinin'
The sky was cryin'
It just tore apart
And down came the rain

An' I was soakin'
Yea I was freezing
But I was feeling
No kind of pain

Come a fireball
I held it in my hand
You see before you
A man who's known greatness

I had a vision
A revelation
I took a look inside of me
And I am a sensation

Days like these
I feel like I can change the world
Days like these
I feel like I can change the world

It's either easy
Or it's impossible
But if you ain't got it
