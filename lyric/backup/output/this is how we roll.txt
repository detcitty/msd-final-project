The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little somethin' bumpin' thump, thumpin' on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at

This is how we roll-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We hangin' 'round singing out everything on the radio-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We light it up with our hands up

This is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burnin' down the night shootin' bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Yeah baby this is how we roll
