I take my drugs in doses

I been waking up to bitches in my hotel suite
We been gone on the molly
Holding onto Friday
Why you looking at me shawty
Recognizing I'm the only, only, only one that's ballin'
Only one that's ballin'
Only one who's going out the country
Gotta keep a translator for the models
Only one, I'm only reppin' fly shit only
Keep some fly shit on me, keep a fly bitch on me

Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only
Fly shit only, fly shit only

My trainers are matching my jacket
I'm strapped with that ratchet, I'm strapped with that Bape and that ape
I'm gone off these medicals, gone off these medicals
Maybe one day I'mma get out the drank
