If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand
That a heart's a heart and we do what we can
If you were a woman and I was a man
If you were a woman and I was a man
I was a man...

How's it feel to be a woman
How's it feel to be a man
Are we really that different
Tell me where you stand
I look at you, you look away
Why do you say we're night and day
I'd like to try another way
Oh baby for just one day

If you were a woman and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand
