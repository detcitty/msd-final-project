Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

When the night falls down

I wait for you and you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids on the street outside
When you walk into the room

You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinnin' with the stars above
