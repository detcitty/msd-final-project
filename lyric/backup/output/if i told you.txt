What if I told you about my little nothing town
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now

What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there is no fixing me
Cause everybody has already tried

Would you stay?
Would you leave?
I could wait
It'll all come out eventually

If I told you all the stupid things I've done
