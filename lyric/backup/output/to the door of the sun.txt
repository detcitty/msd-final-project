I look in the mirror, but I look at a stranger
Can this be the sensible me who said he wouldn't fall in love
I suddenly saw you, and I knew there was danger
Why run away when I love you and want you forever
I know I'm a dreamer, but I don't want to wake up
Whenever you touch me I can fly to the sky
