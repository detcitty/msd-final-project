The party was jumpin'
When Bertha got off o' her stump,
The whistles were blowin'
And everybody did the bump
But all the time bertha
Had been workin' on her goodie
Now folks call it "the Bertha Butt boogie"

When Bertha Butt did her goodie
She started the Bertha Butt boogie
No question

When bertha got movin'
Her hips were hummin' in the wind,
The ground started shakin'
No grass grew where she'd been!
