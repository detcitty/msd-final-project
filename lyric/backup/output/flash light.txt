Now, I lay me down to sleep
Ooh, I just can't find a beat
Flash light (ohh, I will never dance!)
Flash light
Flash light
Flash light

Ha da da dee da hada hada da da

Oh, it's no use!

Flash light
Red light
Neon light
Ooh, stop light

Now I lay me down to sleep
I guess I'll go count the sheep
Oh, but I will never dance

(Oh, don't make me do it)
(Dance, sucker! Ooh ha ha!)
(Oww! Get him!)

Most of all he needs the funk (shine it)
Help him find the funk (ha, funk it!)
Most of all he needs the funk
Help him find the funk (get him)
Most of all he needs the funk (I know we can get him)
Help him find the funk (ho!)
Most of all he needs the funk (ha, don't!)
