I've been waiting all day for you, babe
So won't you come and sit and talk to me?
Tell me how we gonna be together always
Hope you know that when it's late at night
I hold on to my pillow tight
You think of how you promised me forever
(I never thought that anyone)
could make me feel this way
(Now that you're here boy all I want)
is just the chance to say

Get out (leave)
Right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now)
And I can't wait for you to be gone
Cause I know about her (who)
And I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right
But you was just a waste of time
(waste of time)

Tell me why you're looking so confuset
When I'm the one who didn't know the truth
