Something's wrong 'cause my mind is fading,
And everywhere I look there's a dead end waiting.
Temperature's dropping at the rotten oasis.
Stealing kisses from the leperous faces.
Heads are hanging from the garbage man trees.
Mouthwash, jukebox, gasoline.
Pistols are pointing at a poor man's pockets,
Smiling eyes ripping out of his sockets.
