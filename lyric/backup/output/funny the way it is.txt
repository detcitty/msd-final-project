Lying in the park on a beautiful day
Sunshine in the grass, and the children play
Siren's passing, fire engine red
Someone's house is burning down on a day like this

The evening comes and we're hanging out
On the front step and a car rolls by with the windows rolled down
And that war song is playing, why can't we be friends?
Someone is screaming and crying in the apartment upstairs

Funny the way it is, if you think about it
Somebody's going hungry and someone else is eating out
