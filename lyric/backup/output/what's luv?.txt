What's luv?
It should be about us, it should be about trust, babe

What's luv?
Yeah, uh, uh, uh, woo, yeah, slow down, baby
Let you know from the gate I don't go down, lady
I wanna chick with thick hips that licks her lips
She can be the office type or like to strip
Girl, you get me aroused how you look in my eye
But you talk too much, man, you're ruinin' my high
Don't wanna lose the feelin' 'cuz the roof is chillin'

It's on fire and you lookin' good for the gettin'
I'ma, rider, whether in a hoodie or a linen
A provider, you should see the jewelery on my women
And I'm livin' it up, the Squad stay fillin' the truck
With chicks that's willin' to triz with us, uh
You say you gotta man and you're in love
But what's love gotta do with a little menage?
After the party, me and you
Could just slide for a few and she could come too
