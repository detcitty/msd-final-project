Daylight, all right
I don't know, I don't know if it's real
Been a long night and something ain't right
You won't show, you won't show how you feel

No time ever seems right
To talk about the reasons why you and I fight
It's high time to draw the line
Put an end to this game before it's too late

Head games, it's you and me baby
Head games, and I can't take it anymore
