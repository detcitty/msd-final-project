Oh yeah!
I've gone through changes
I've gone through pain
But there's not enough reason

For me to go insane
I know the feeling
Just when it grows
I'm in a rage up from my head

Down to my toes
You know it ain't easy
Running out of thrills
You know it ain't easy
When you don't know what you want

What do you want? Whoa oh ho
You want to rock now, rock the night
Till early in the morning light
Rock now, rock the night

Whoa oh, whoa oh, yea
Rock now, rock the night
