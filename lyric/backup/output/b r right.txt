I want my ass smacked
Legs wide
Front back
Side to side
Pussy wet
Slip 'n slide
Yep everythin' gon' be alright

Ass smacked
Legs wide
Front back
Side to side
Pussy wet
Slip 'n slide
Yep everythin' gon' be alright

Wait bitch, I'mma blow my kisses
Get pissed and throw my dishes
Y'all niggas know jus' who this is
Woo woo, and the head so vicious

With me, this shit gon' cost
You short? Then tha's yo lost
You know this ass is soft
Make a nigga goto breakin' off

Tell me that you love me baby
Get hot and fuck me crazy
Get a towel and wipe me off
You want a bitch wit no type of flaws

My gurls be shoppin' hard
These hoes be buyin' cars
In the club buyin' bars
Nipples hard in designer bras

From the niggas who gettin' cheese
Throw back in the crispy G's
More wet? Crist don't freeze
Laugh at the tab, 'cause this on me

Me and Luda in the cut supreme
Doin' things jus' to touch the cream
So many names, wanna fuck the queen
I live a life like it's jus' a dream

I want my ass smacked
Legs wide
Front back
Side to side
Pussy wet
