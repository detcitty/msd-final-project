Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em, man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em, put your number two's in the air if you did it on 'em

All these bitches is my sons
And I'm go and get some bibs for 'em
A couple formulas, little pretty lids on 'em
If I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on 'em
Let me shake it off
I just signed a couple deals I might break you off
And we ain't making up I don't need a mediator
Just let them bums blow steam, radiator
