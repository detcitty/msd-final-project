Oh
Oh

I missed the bus.(Oh). I missed the bus.
I missed the bus.(Oh). I missed the bus.

I went to bed late but I didn't think late would AFFECT ME
Early came around then late wouldn't LET ME
Wake up - WAKE UP - so I can get dressed
I guess my body was mad 'cause I gave it no rest
And when I finally did awake it was a quarter to 8: 00
