I should have stolen every moment
Now there's a page with not enough on it
Where we belong
I guess I'll never understand it
Why do we take it all for granted
Until it's gone
Cause then it's gone

Love who you love
With all that you have
And don't waste the time that flies so fast
Love who you love
And say that you do
