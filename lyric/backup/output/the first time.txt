You know I won't forget the times we shared together holding hands
and walking in the park
Sometimes we'll have to do it all again
We were so happy then
I've no regrets
Can't you tell from the look on my face that I love you more today

The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes
Wiped the tears away
The first time when we fell in love
