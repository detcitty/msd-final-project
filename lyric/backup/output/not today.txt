This is another one of those heartbreak hotel joints for the ladies

Why won't you grow up and be a man someday?
I can't believe that you're still playin' silly games
Now why do I put up with all this child's play?
Now if your word is all you have then you ain't worth a damn thing

Promises you told me every day
That you made you never ever kept
By me, I really want to believe
But not today, not today, not today, not today

You're the worst, I can't even depend on you
You say a lot of good things but somethin' else you always do
