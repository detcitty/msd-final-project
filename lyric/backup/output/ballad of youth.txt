Growing up today
There's many mountains you must climb
You're not the only one
'Cause everybody's on that line
Hey mister know it all
What do you recommend
You think you know the answers
But the questions never end

Young hearts better hold on
Beyond the innocence
Your youth is gone
So look in your mirror
You got nothing to lose
