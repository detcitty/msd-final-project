It's Iggy Iggz
I got one more problem with you girl
Aye

Hey baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya, I want you
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to, I want you
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why did you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it, I want you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
