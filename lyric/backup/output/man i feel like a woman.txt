Let's go girls, c'mon
I'm goin' out tonight, I'm feelin' alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise, really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

No inhibitions, make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain't gonna act politically correct
I only wanna have a good time

The best thing about bein' a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and

Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy, forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts

Oh, oh, oh, really go wild-yeah, doin' it in style
