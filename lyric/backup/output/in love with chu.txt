When my body yearnin it's (You)

Im in love like Maxwell
You see me cryin but I just cant help it
Myself esteem is even higher when im walking with you
You give me fire and desire
Like Tina Marie and Rick James do
I don't care burn up the minutes on the cell
Just turn up the music and feel its hard as hell
I get abusive with the flows on me
