I am the searcher of my fortunes
I've got my right hand on the wheel
We've got to dig the buried treasures
I know, exactly how I feel

Don't want to live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
But then you must believe
In the falling rain

Don't wanna live inside myself
Don't wanna live inside myself
Don't wanna live inside myself
