I keep gettin' closer to the love I know
I'm ready and willin', gettin' outta control
You win and you lose some, but if you stay in the game

Before you know it you feel the fire
But don't get burned by the flame
Oh, you'll find the answer any day

With every beat of my heart
I keep gettin closer to you
With every beat of my heart
Now I know we're gettin' closer to love
With every beat
