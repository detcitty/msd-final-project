I fell out of bed
This morning
Oh, something was buggin' me
I couldn't sleep â€˜cause I hadn't had any lovin'

So I've got to solve this problem out, baby
And darling, I know what the remedy should be

At night when I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover to keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

As the day goes by
Thought weighs heavy on my mind
Only thing I think about
Is tonight the lights go out
