Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Our love is so
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, be-do be-dumb
Wha, wha, why?

You tell me that you need me, but then you wanna leave me
And never make your way to the door
I tell you that you're too much and that I'll miss you too much
Don't even know what we're fighting for

You key my car, girl, and then you go get it fixed
I talk all them other chicks just to make you jealous
How can we make it right when we both put up a fit?
You make me so mad it's kind of hard to forgive

But when I look into your pretty eyes
My heart just drops

Girl, you make me
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
