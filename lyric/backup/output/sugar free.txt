Err, in the lamp light check the scene
In the day my life is a dream
Do you know who you're talking to
Again I'm so glad baby that I'm not like you

Fire in your head, river in your bed
Two hundred dollar, see his face go red
Lost in a world where nothin' is nothin'
Burnt pretty bad, can't get another hit-ah

Oh, my love and me, oh, we're sugar free
Oh, this oughta be, burnin' up, breakin' down
