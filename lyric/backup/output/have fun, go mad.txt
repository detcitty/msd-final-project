All aboard that funkboat that
I'm about to start sailin' now on
All you reaggers and all your party trickers
Everybody's in the funky blowout
You know Wez said sell from just around the corner
From the Porter Bella Road
Downtown W Tender my bass a-baby
Baby do what ya done till, I got

Bottles of beer and a deck of two
All my friends are now coming in
Lousiana Jones, looking good girls
So open the bottle let the party begin
I'm on a mic, make ya dance, make ya funk, make you sweat
From now until the break of dawn
So get off the rollers, have a ball
From now till the morning comes, and I said

Have fun, go mad
(Do what I say)
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
(A come on)
Have fun living in the city

Have fun, go mad
(Do what I say)
Have fun, go mad
Have fun, go mad
