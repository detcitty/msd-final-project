Runnin' round in this new truck
Bank let's me borrow from month to month
Runnin' out of credit and find a little cash on the radio
Standin' still they're blowin past, numbers on cars goin' Nascar fast
What I wouldn't give for a slow down, don't ya know
Cause where I come from only the horses run
When the day is done, we take it easy

Meanwhile back at Mama's
the porch light's on, come in if you wanna
Supper's on the stove and beers in the fridge
