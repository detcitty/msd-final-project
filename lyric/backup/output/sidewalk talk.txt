Watch where you walk cause the sidewalks talk
And you can't keep a secret from the ground beneath you
Step very lightly on the earth below
Or before you know it everyone will know

Streets were paved with a thousand eyes
And try as you may you can't disguise
There's only two things that you can't hide from
That's you and the ground you're walking on

Chorus

Watch where you walk, cause the sidewalks talk
You better watch what you do, what you do
Cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away
You better watch what you say, what you say

Think when you speak cause you gotta long the street
They can read what you say so you gotta stay away
From words that sting, words are not true
And the things you say make a fool of you
