You said when the storm came
That you would be there with your umbrella to block the rain
And you said you'd protect me
From heartache, pain, lies, loneliness, and misery
You said you'd tear down the walls that were in my way
You promised things would be okay
And I stood there in the freezing cold
And I waited for you, but you never showed

Where you at? Oh, where you at? Oh, where you at?
Boy you say would be here for me
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)

Where you at? (Where you at?)

Now you said you go to church
