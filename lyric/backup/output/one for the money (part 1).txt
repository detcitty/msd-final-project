Get on down
Heartbeat
Come on, do it
Hey, hey
Come on down
Oh, all the people
Get up
(Get up)
Get outta your seat
Everybody mingle
Come on and dance to the beat
Grab yourself a partner
Nice, get them outta their seat
Everybody stay free
Dance to the beat, just dance
Everybody dance oh
One for the money
(Two for the show)
Well, well
