You gotta have love in your heart
You gotta have a song on your lips
You gotta let freedom roll
Then you'll feel good
Yes you will

I look out my window
And what do I see
I see a world that's full of confusion
And I know just what it needs

It needs to have a little love in its heart
It's gotta have a song you can sing
It's gotta let freedom roll
