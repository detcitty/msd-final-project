I remember the year
That clayton delaney died
They said for the last two weeks
That he suffered and cried
It made a big impression on me
Although i was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end
And i'm glad that he did

Clayton was the best guitar picker
In our town
I thought he was a hero
