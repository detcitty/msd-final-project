I'm love, love crazy
Crazy over you
I'm love, love crazy
I'm helpless
There's nothing I can do

Cupid, he must have
Shot me with his arrow
When I first saw your face
Cause I, I been floating
On a cloud ever since
Girl, I'm just a hopeless case

The first time that I held you
I knew that it was just
A matter of time before
I did what comes naturally when
A pretty girl blows your mind

I think about you
In the middle of the day
Thinking how much I love you
And if everything's okay

Can't wait to hug you
And squeeze you, oh, so tight
Then make such good love to you
You'll be hanging on for dear life
