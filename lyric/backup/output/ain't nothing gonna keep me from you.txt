Ain't Nothing Gonna Keep me From You
Wind and fire and fallin' rain
I'll be comin' through
There ain't nothin' gonna keep me from you
My love (no nothing), nothin' gonna keep me from you, my love
I'll find you
Anyplace where you may hide
I'll be by your side
There ain't nothin' gonna keep me from you
My love (no, nothin'), nothin' gonna keep me from you, my love
I'll find you
Heaven and earth I will move for you, darlin'
