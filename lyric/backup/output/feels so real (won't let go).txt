Feels so real
And my mind won't let go
Feels so real
And my mind won't let go

It is a night I won't forget
The kind you dream of
Sweet candlelight, the mood is set
I'm ready for love

Your kiss, your sweet embrace
I'll never be the same
Are you my dream come true
You just thrilled me so, won't let go

Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (Is this my dream come true)
It feels so real
And my mind won't let go

Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (No matter what I do)
It feels so real
And my mind won't let go

So close to you and yet so far
It tears me apart
