I've seen a lot of places, I've been around the world
I've seen some pretty faces, been with some beautiful girls
After all I've witnessed, one thing still amazes me
Just like a miracle, you have to see to believe

'Cause God blessed Texas with His own hand
Brought down angels from the Promised Land
He gave them a place where they could dance
