Love is a flower that blooms
In the springtime, 
('In the springtime')
Beneath the light of the moon
In the springtime; 
('In the springtime')
We're groovin' together, like two turtle doves; 
Since I met you baby, 
Everything's coming up love, 
('Everything's coming up love')
Everything's coming up love, baby, 
('Everything's coming up love, love, love, love')

Love is a song in the breeze, 
In the springtime, 
('In the springtime')
Sung by the birds and the bees, 
In the springtime.
('In the springtime')
Lovers are strollin', 
Blue skies above, 
Dreams are unfoldin',
