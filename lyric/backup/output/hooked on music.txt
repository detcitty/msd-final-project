Well it was New Years Eve
I was 14 at the time
I was celebratin' 4 AM
With them hoodlum friends of mine
I heard a boy named Elvis Presley
Singin' "That's Alright Mama" on the radio
And it turned me on

I been hooked on music
Hooked on music from that moment on

Well all my friends thought I had one brick less than a load
'Cause I'd stop the car and I'd jump out
And start dancin' in the road
When I heard Jerry Lee Lewis singin'
"Whole lot of shakin' goin' on'"
It turned me on

And I been hooked on music
