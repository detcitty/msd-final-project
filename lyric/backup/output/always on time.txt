Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain

So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein' me

I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin' your braids

Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin' you all wild
