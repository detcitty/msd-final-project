Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up

That's how we ball out
Strip clubs and dollar bills
I still got mo' money
Patron shots, can I get a refill
I still got mo' money

Strippers going up and down that pole

And I still got mo' money
Four o clock and we aint going home
Cause I still got mo' money
Money make the world go around

I still got mo' money
Bands make your girl go down

And I still got mo' money
Lot mo' where dat came from
