I remember the sound of the passing train
As it rolled through the night in the pouring rain
And the touch of a hand and the way she said 'Goodbye'.
And we walked in the sun down The Royal Mile
Saw the light in her eye and the way she smiled
And she cried in the night and I heard her say 'Don't go'.
