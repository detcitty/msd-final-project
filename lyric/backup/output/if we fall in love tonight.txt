Pain, flows like a river, just keeps on livin'
with all them memories
Shame, you're so heartbroken
now you're scared to open and give your love again
And now anticipation waits for love
Will it be everything you dreamed this time around
I know you have your doubts
but I won't let you down

Darlin' if, if we fall in love tonight
you're gonna be alright
