Everybody likes a celebration
Happy music and conversation
I'd be lying if I said
I never got the blues
So pardon me for my disposition
You see, I just can't keep
From wishing that I
Was celebrating too
[CHORUS]
I know (I know)
This night (this night)
Won't last forever
I know (I know)
The sun's (the sun)
Got to shine sometime
I got (I got)
