I wonder where your heart is 'cause it sure don't feel like it's here
Sometimes I think you wish that I would just disappear
Have I got it all wrong, have you felt this way long?
Are you already gone?

Do you feel lonely when you're here by my side?
Does the sound of freedom echo in your mind?
Do you wish you were by yourself or that I was someone else?
