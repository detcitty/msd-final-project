Here I am
On my own
It gets hard sometimes
When I'm travelling this empty world all alone
And I get tired
And oh, I get oh so weak
And I need for someone to come rescue me

To help me along
To catch when I miss
To show me where I ought to be
So I can be strong
And face all of this
That my life tries to discourage me with
