Word is bond
Yeah, Face

I will love you any way, baby
Any way and every way I can
'Cause I'm that kind of man, yes

I will give you everything, baby
Give you more than any girl can stand
I'm gonna love you baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm talking 'bout makin' love in the shower at least an hour
And let you dangle in my arms 'cause love is power
Can you feel it? The sky's the limit once you reveal it
Your heart was wounded, God sent me to heal it

On a mission, ain't no stress, love
Touch you with precision, just undress, love
I know the right position, come on, trust me girl
Throw this rock up on your hand, I'll give you the world

Hey yo, Face
