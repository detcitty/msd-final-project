What's yo' name?
What's yo' naaaaaame?
burp My name is, Ol Dirty Bastard... and I'mma Alkaholik
Yeah me too nigga
singin some crazy shit

You're now rockin with Tha Liks so start reachin for the ozone
I see some girls I know but y'all look different with your clothes on
What's up though, Tash came to steal it like the Grinch
While I'm leavin niggas puzzled like I said my shit in French
But it's all Olde English that I'm bringin from beneath
Try to bite my style on wax and watch these lyrics crack your teeth
Cause I make words Connect like Westside when I test glide
My drunken lyrical hanglider, nobody's tighter
Than a ruff rap provider, with ninety ways to peel ya
So I know the three words (Tash'll kill ya) sound familiar
I filter out the weak everytime I speak
I drink to hit the peak to make my mind go (beep)
I'm def-da-fyin, you rappin like my client
Tryin to scrape me for the style that slam harder than Kobe Bryant
BE QUIET! This is Likwidation from the West
Motherfuck ya boozy show, I got my own special guest

Yo, yo, breaker breaker breaker one-nine
I bust this bitch in the behind with the silver shine
Cause she thought she was fine
She winked at me, I thought it was fine
This nigga poutin, this ho was mine
I had the alcohol in me, took my time
Let a nigga ro-tate turn on the table
Put in the diamond needle, pull it to your ego
What? You the king in the chair on my ground
The Tyson of sound, it's twenty seconds to a round
Scavenger nigga, youse a shrimp, a full line of shit
My ear can't digest it
