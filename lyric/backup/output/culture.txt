They try to play us, they play themselves
(808 Mafia) This the intro
For all you fuckboys that ever doubted the Migos
You played yourself! (Another one)
Fuckboy, bow down

Spin off in the coupe, typhoon (skrt skrt)
I act an ass, baboon
Wrappin' that dope, cocoon
Young rich nigga in the room
Finesse a nigga, no raccoon
Spendin' M&M's in June
Took a trip to Cancun
CULTURE album comin' soon (Another one)

Yeah, I bought the Benz off the lot
Just to give your ho a lift
I'm havin' the sauce in the refrigerator
Just make sure you bring the chips
Ayy, it's a fuck nigga in the back
Just look at him, look at him plot
He prolly think it's a club light
But really it's the red dot
