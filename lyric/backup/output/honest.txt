Dark Marzal on me I'm just honest

Rock star my swag I'm just honest
Everything exotic I'm just honest
Gold all on my neck I'm just honest
Yeah, I'm just honest
We got the club on smash
Name another nigga hot I'm just honest

Gold bottles on bottles, I'm just honest
100, 000 on watches I'm just honest
Coupes all on coupes, I'm just honest
I keep a gang of bad bitches with me too
And we ain't never going back to what we used to do
I was gon' lie to you but I had to tell the truth
I'm just being honest
