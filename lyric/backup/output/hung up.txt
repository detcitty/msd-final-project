Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

(...)
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby, night and day
I'm fed up

I'm tired of waiting for you.
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up

I don't know what to do
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

I don't know what to do
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
Baby, night and day
I'm fed up

I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up
I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call
