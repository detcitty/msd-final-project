Baby, let me do it, let me do it to you
Let me kiss you, baby
Baby, can I do it? Can I do it to you?
Can I kiss you, baby?

'Cause baby, you're giving me such a groovy sensation
But don't stop it now, baby, I might lose your vibration
Your sweet conversation, it keeps turning me on, yeah

My mind is so weak, girl, all my resistance is gone
