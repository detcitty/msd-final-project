(Bum, bum, bum, bum)
You send cold chills
Up and down my spine
We kiss for thrills
Then you draw the line
Oh baby

'Cause your mama told you
That love ain't right
But don't you know
Good lovin' is the spice of life Yeah

(Chorus)
Mama's pearl, let down those curls
Won't you give my love a whirl
Find what you been missin'
Ooh, ooh, now baby
Goody girl, let down those curls
