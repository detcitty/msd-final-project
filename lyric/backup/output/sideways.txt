Hey girl, what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thing,
But I sure do like your style,
And I can see you came to rock
In your blue jeans and white tank top;
Man that look drives me wild.

And it's hey now here we go.
DJ don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor
Gotta make them want to come back for more.
Been here since the sun went down,
Be here when it comes back around
Worked all week it's time to play
