Ooh yeah
Said anything that you want me to and I'll do it
Tell me what the word is?
(Already)
Tell me what the word is?
(Already)
Tell me what the word is?
(Already)
Tell me what the word is?
(Already)

Baby, don't look no farther
Baby, I'm back here
I'm here to cater to you
 (Anything that you want me to I'll do it)

'Cause I'll be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
And I'll be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do
 (Tell me what I gotta do and I'll do it)

Now I'm back in a flesh, feelin' so blessed
Back in your corner suga, suga don't stress
Forget about the rest, let's go inside
I'm back in your zone, baby, I'm back in your vibe

Now I can't be denied I can lie I'm on ya
