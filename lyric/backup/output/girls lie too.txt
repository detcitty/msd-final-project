So she can? t go out tonight again
Her sister? s sick, she? s gotta baby-sit
Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good excuse

Now you didn? t hear any of this from me
But things aren? t always what they seem
Brace yourself, this may come as a shock to you

Girls lie too
We don? t care how much money you make
What you drive or what you weigh
Size don? t matter anyway

Girls lie too
