I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby

Little sun left to burn in the blue sky
Shinin' off the cross hangin' from the mirror of my ride
Breeze blowin' in, your hair blowin' round
You're scanning through the stations lookin' for that country sound
The good stuff iced up in the back seat
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be

I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
