She don't throw any T-shirt on an walk to a bar,
She don't text her friends and say, I gotta get somethin' out, she don't say it's okay, I never loved him anyway.
She don't scroll threw her phone just looking for a band-aid,
It's different for girls when their hearts get broke they can't tape it back together with a whiskey and coke, they don't take someone home and act like its nothin',
They can't just switch it off everytime they feel somethin',
