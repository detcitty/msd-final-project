Straight muthafuckin' ballin'
Part two, still ballin'
Westside

Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
Still ballin', ridin' on these niggaz 'cause they lame
In a 61' Chevy still heavy in this game
Can you feel me?

Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sunrise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch made niggaz hit em' up
Westside

Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord, forgive me if I smoke
I love my female strapped, love fuckin' from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California's where I'm at
Ride

Pass by, while these niggaz wonder why
I got shot but didn't die, let em' see who's next to try
Did I cry, hell nah, nigga not a tear shed
For all my homies in the pen, many peers dead
Nigga, still ballin'

Still ballin' until the day I die
(Still ballin', until I die)
You can bring your crew
(You can bring your crew)
