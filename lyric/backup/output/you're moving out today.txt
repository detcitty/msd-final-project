(Carole Bayer Sager/Bette Midler/Bruce Roberts)
I stayed out late one night and you moved in
I didn't mind 'cause of the state you were in
May I remind you that it's been a year since then

Today the landlady, she said to me (what did she say?)
You're looney friend just made a pass at me (slap him in the face)
Perhaps you might enjoy a cottage by the sea

So pack your toys away
Your pretty boys away
