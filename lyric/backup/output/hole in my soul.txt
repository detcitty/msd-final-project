I'm down a one way street
With a one night stand
With a one track mind
Out in no man's land
The punishment sometimes

Don't seem to fit the crime
Yeah there's a hole in my soul
But one thing I've learned
For every love letter written
There's another one burned
So you tell me how it's gonna be this time

Is it over?
Is it over?
'cause i'm blowin' out the flame

Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns
The knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find
There's nothing there, girl
Yeah i swear, i'm telling you, girl yeah 'cause
