Nigga, I got these hoes iced up enough
While my lil' B.G's on the bus puttin' out cigarette butts
But me personally playboy, I don't give a fuck
And I'ma always show love to my cut

Hit the club, light tha bitch up
The Cash Money motto we got to drank 'til we throw up
Nigga point the hoe out, guaranteed I can fuck
Wootay, I'm tattooed and barred up

Medallion iced up, Rolex bezelled up and my pinky ring is platinum plus
Earrings be trillion cut and my grill be slugged up
My heart filled with anger 'cause nigga I don't give a fuck
Stack my cheese up 'cause one day I'm a give this street life up

Beef I don't discuss, a nigga outta line gone
Get his motherfuckin' head bust, Cash Money Millionaires plus
Don't touch sumthin' nigga you can't fuck, twenty inches TV is a must
By the year two thousand I'm gut out my bus

A lil' nigga seventeen playin' with six figures
Got so much ice you can skate on a nigga
When you see Cash Money you know you stay flossin'
Catch cha girl down bad ya know we straight tossin'

I ain't seen a click yet that can stunt like mine
I ain't seen a marette that can run like mine
1999 and it's our turn to shine
Fifty or better on our wrist and they all blind

Pourin' vodka 'til I die drank 'til I faint
