Every time I look at U
There's so many things that I wanna do
I promise U when i'm ready
I'm gonna spend my whole life with U

What is love is it steady
Cause I don't know what to do
So tell me girl if your ready
To do what we came to do

One day we could be together
Cause U know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now we can all forget it
U know I gots to get around
