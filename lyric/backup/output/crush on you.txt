How did you know 'cause I never told
But you found out I've got a crush on you
The words you read, my heart's been displayed
You found out I've got a crush on you

You must have heard it from my best friend
She's always talkin' when she should be listenin'
Can't keep a secret to save her life
But still I trusted her with all I felt inside

I never knew a rumor could spread so fast
'Cause now the word is out all over town
