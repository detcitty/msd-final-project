Who am I?
I'm just a guy who only wants to try
To do what's right and never make you cry
But you're no good to me, and

Who do you think you are?
You try to push me a bit too far
And every day sees another scar
Tell me, who do you think you are?
If you want me there, you gotta care
Who do you think you are, taking advantage of me this way?
