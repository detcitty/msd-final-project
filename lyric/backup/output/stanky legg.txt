Ahh, Southside is who I be!
Say I got my G-Spot Boyz with me, ya dig?
Prince Charming and my boy Slizz
And we gotta new dance for y'all, ya dig?
Ya dig?

Bitch I'm wide
Do da stanky legg, do da stanky legg, do da stanky legg
When I hit da dance floor I be
Doin' da stanky legg, do da stanky legg, do da stanky legg

Bitch I'm wired up
Do da stanky legg, do da stanky legg, do da stanky legg
When I hit da dance floor I be
Do da stanky legg, do da stanky legg, do da stanky legg

When I hit da dance floor you know I'm doin' da stanky legg
Southside merengue and then you rub across ya head
You a ace boon coon chick, you can do it too

Snap ya fingers in the air and shake yo micros too
Now you can lean wit it, and you can drop wit it
You can switch to the other legg and you can stop wit it

Now get it, get it, now get it, get it
Now get it, get it, now get it, get it
