Golden days, life was play
Pain was all a world away
We went to school, we learned the rules
We trusted all they had to say
Then life took a turn
We all had to learn
And we can't go back again

And my heart is breaking
Just for you, just for you
And my arms are open
Just for you, just for you
Just for you
