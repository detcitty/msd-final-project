You'll never know what you've done for me
What your faith in me has done for my soul
And you'll never know the gift you've given me
I'll carry it with me, yea yea

Through the days ahead I'll think of days before
You made me hope for something better
Yes you did

And made me reach for something more

You taught me to run, you taught me to fly
Helped me to free the me inside
