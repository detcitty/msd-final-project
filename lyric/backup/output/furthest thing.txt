Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show their face now
What they got to say now?
Nothing they can say now
Nothing really changed, but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothing was the same
I still been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the low

I still been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinking on the low
Mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low
Smokin on the low
I just been plotting on the low
Scheming on the low
The furthest thing from perfect Like everyone I know
