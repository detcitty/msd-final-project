We got winners
We got losers
Chain-smokers and boozers
We got yuppies
We got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar

We got cowboys
We got truckers
Broken-hearted fools and suckers
And we got hustlers
We got fighters
