Walking out tonight in the street lights I can see you,
Arm in arm with just another guy,
You look at me and wave hello-how friendly,
I look at you and the cars go passing by.

I understand that you used to love me,
Nothing much but it made you cry,
So here we are making pleasant gestures,
and I just can't see the reason why.

Me and you we never made it far girl,
Now I laugh at the promises we made,
