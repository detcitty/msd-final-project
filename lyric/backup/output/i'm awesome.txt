Awesome, Awesome, Awesome, Awesome
I don't necessarily have to be here for this
I'm gonna keep the headphones though
I'm awesome
No you're not dude, don't lie
I'm awesome
I'm driving round in my mom's ride
I'm awesome
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
I'm awesome
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome
There's no voice mail nobody called
I'm awesome
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall
You know my pants sag low(low)
Even though(though) that went out of style like
Ten years ago(go)
Spose... I got the swagger of a cripple
I got little biceps, getting fatter in the middle
And lyrically I'm not the best
Physically the opposite of Randy Moss and yet so preposterous
Feel the awesomeness the most obnoxious guest up at the sausage fest
Oh yes
The girls are repulsed so I hide in my hood like I'm joining a cult
Uh huh
I'm as nervous as my cattle dirty Curtis
All my writtens are bitten and all my verses are purchased
Me, I'll never date an actress
Got too many back zits
Plus my whole home aroma is cat piss
Every show I do is poorly promoted and if you like this
It's cause my little sister wrote it
