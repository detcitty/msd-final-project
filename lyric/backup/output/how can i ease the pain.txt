All alone, on my knees I pray
For the strength to stay away
In and out, out and in you go
I feel your fire
Then I lose my self control

How can I ease the pain
When I know your coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart

How can I ease the pain
When I know your coming back again
And how can I ease the pain in my heart
