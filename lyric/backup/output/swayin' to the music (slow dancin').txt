It's late at night and we're all alone
Just the music on the radio
No one's comin', no one's gonna telephone
Just me and you and the lights down low

And we're slow dancin', swayin' to the music
Slow dancin', just me and my girl
Slow dancin', swayin' to the music
No one else in the whole wide world just you, girl
