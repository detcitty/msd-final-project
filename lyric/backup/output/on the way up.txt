I'm on the way up
Look out! Ow!
Babe
Oh, babe

People tell me I can't have everything
But still I wanna have it all
They say I cannot succeed in life
That I'll get so far and then I'll fall

I don't need no negative outlook
I don't need nobody putting me down
Don't they know that talk is useless?
Nothing's gonna keep my feet on the ground

Because I'm on the way up
I've got it all 2gether
Nothing's gonna hold me back
