Shock!
I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How can a person like me care for you
Why do I bother
When you're not the one for me

Is enough enough
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
