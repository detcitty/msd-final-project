You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop
'Cause you a bug-a boo
You buggin' what?
You buggin' who?
You buggin' me and don't you see it ain't cool

It's not hot
That you be callin' me stressin me pagin' my beeper you're just non-stop
And it's not hot
That you be leavin' me messages every 10 minutes and then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
'Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number you already had my mailbox full

So what
You bought a pair of shoes
What now I guess you think I owe you (Owe you)
You don't have to call as much as you do
I'll give 'em back to be through with you
And so what
My momma likes you (Likes you)
What now I guess you think I will too
Even if the Pope he said he likes you too
I don't really care 'cause you're a bug a boo
