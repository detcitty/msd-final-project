You've got me captured, I'm under your spell
I guess I'll never learn
I have your picture, yes, I know it well
Another page is turned

Are you for real? It's so hard to tell
From just a magazine
Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

I'll wait 'til your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
