There can be one only you
And baby, God could never make two
And I know you came here with your crew
But I promise you that it feels like it's just us two

Oh, I don't know what you had planned to do tonight
But I just wanna be the one to do you right
We're standing here looking at each other, baby, eye to eye
And I'm hoping that you're thinking about leaving with me tonight

Who said you can't find love in a club?
Cause I wanna tell them they wrong
Come on, just baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
You gon' be my baby
Love me, love you crazy
Tell me if you with it
