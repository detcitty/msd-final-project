The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of
Drop everything now

Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
