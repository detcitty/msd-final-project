When they come to take you down, when they bring that wagon 'round,
when they come to call on you,
and drag your poor body down,

just one thing I ask of you,
it's just one thing for me.
Please forget you knew my name,
my darling Sugaree.
Shake it, shake it sugaree,
just don't tell them that you know me.
Shake it, shake it sugaree,
just don't tell them that you know me.

You thought you was the cool fool, never could do no wrong.
You had everything sewed up tight. How come you lay awake all night long?
