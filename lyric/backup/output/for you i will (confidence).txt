Wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have

Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel about you

Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will

Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head
