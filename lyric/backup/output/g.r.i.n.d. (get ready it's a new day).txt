Yeah, yeah, yo, yo, this one's for the people
All the B's that'll bleed and they sleep and they eat
Shit believe the thought we're all equal
Ain't a man on God's green be underneath any other

I don't wanna play preacher
But, but I swear they turn their ear
When we talk about peace and love
Sometimes might need a hug, yeah

We all wanna come on up above
But this ain't about Jesus, no way, no Abe
No Ike, Moses or Mohammed
Yeah, it's all about believing full steam ahead

Because I know the worst times are behind me
I don't wanna sound cheesy but, but, but
I just a really mean it, eh, eh, yeah
I'm tellin' I can feel it, eh, eh
It's the reason I was sleep, I be way too geek tonight

This one's for all of y'all
I'm the same as all of y'all, I'm on my shit
I work real hard and all for every little bit that I get
But this is all I need, so sing this song with me
