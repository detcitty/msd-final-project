Don't bother telling me what I got coming in the morning
I already know
I got some feelgood pills and a red Gatorade by my bed
...

Ready to go
I'm gonna do my best to dance with every girl in this bar
Before they shut it down
Then I'll pay my tab, climb in a cab

Headin' to a spot downtown
It's all about tonight
Good times, and the music and laughing, and grooving to the band
...
Everybody's getting right
No worries, we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
