Falling In Love (uh-oh) LyricsMiami Sound Machine
Feel like another crook that's been captured by your stare
Uh-oh, uh-oh - falling in love, falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh - an' I don't want it, no no no
Uh-oh, uh-oh - falling in love, falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh - falling, falling
Jealous feelings reappearing, such a wicked day
I'm just so damn confused an' I wonder, do you care?
