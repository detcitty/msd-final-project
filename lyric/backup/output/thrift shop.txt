Hey Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?

What, what, what, what?

(Bada, bada, badadada)

OH!

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm-I'm-I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome!

Nah, walk up to the club, like "What up? I got a big cock!"
I'm so pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe, it's so damn frosty
The people like "Damn, that's a cold ass honkey!"
Rollin' in, hella deep, headed to the Mezzanine
Dressed in all pink, 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girls standin' next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets
(Pissssss!)
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents! (Bag it)
