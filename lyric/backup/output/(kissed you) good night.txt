I dropped you off
Just a little after midnight
Sat in my car
Till you turned off your porch light
I should have kissed you
I should have pushed you up against the wall
I should have kissed you
Just like I wasn't scared at all

I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock

And met me on the front porch
