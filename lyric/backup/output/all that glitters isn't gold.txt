Yesterday, I met a boy so fine
Right away I knew
He'd captivate my mind

So strong
The kind you dream about
Baby, together
We could really turn it out

I showed him to
Some friends of mine
They said, girl
Don't waste your time

That boy's no good for you
Listen, girl, I'm telling you
I think it's time you knew that

[CHORUS]
