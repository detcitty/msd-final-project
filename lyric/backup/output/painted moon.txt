Walking home in the rain
Blood runs cold in my veins
News from a distant shore
Blues like never before

The moon is new
The moon is full
The moon is blue
The moon is cruel
Painted moon

Coming to the rescue
Angels from another world
Love is here to stay
So the angels say
Running to the rescue
Angels flying up above
