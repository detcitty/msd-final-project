(feat. Kymani Marley)

[Chorus: Prince Be]

We be movin' on up
To the eastside
Where I can do my bid in a phat ass crib in the sky
We be movin' on up
To the eastside
And it looks like we gonna get some cream from the pie

[Verse 1: Ky-Mani]

I always aim at the right gate
Make you bite ate
Running jooks on the lightweight
Monopolize jeans
Brooklyn hone my genes
Baby burners get squeezed
Move up movin' apartment twenty two m
Forty fours for the coolin'
Trips puttin' two in
Shadey broads off tour suin'
Who hate us
Little Kevin double down on eleven out in Vegas
