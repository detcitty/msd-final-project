I was walking
Down a one-way street
Just a-looking
For someone to meet
One woman
Who was looking for a man

Now I'm hoping (hoping)
That the feeling is right
And I'm wondering (wondering)
If you'll stay for the night
So I'm coming
(I don't wanna be lonely)
(Baby, please tell me)
I wanna love you all over
