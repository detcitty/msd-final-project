Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

When I'm with my friends
And the man talk begins
And they brag about all the love they've known
I sit in the corner all alone
The best thing I can do is listen
The most I've done is just some kissin'

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love (really love) a virgin man

How come people say
Lady virgin that's OK
But when the conversation turns around
