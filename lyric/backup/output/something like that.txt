It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair,
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget

I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
