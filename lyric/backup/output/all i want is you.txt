(Carly Simon/Jacob Brackman/Andy Goldmark)

What do the neighbors say
When they hear us scream at night
Do they talk about a love
All in tatters

What do the neighbors know
About the heart and soul
The fire down below
That really matters

They can never guess
In the silences
That all I want is you
And the sexy hurricane we got here

All I want is you
I don't want a man who says
Good morning, dear, no, no
