Hit the beat and take it to the verse now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I love you
But I gotta stay true
My morals got me on my knees
I'm begging please
Stop playing games
I don't know what this is
Cause you got me good
Just like you knew you would

I don't know what you do
But you do it well
I'm under your spell
