It's going down
I'm yelling: timber
You better move
You better dance
Let's make a night
You won't remember
I'll be the one
You won't forget

Ooh ooh ooh ooh (Timber)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh (Timber)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh (It's going down)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh (Timber)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh (Timber)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh (It's going down)

The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs (Timber)
Face down, booty up (Timber)
That's the way we like to what (Timber)
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will (Timber)

Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down (Oh oh oh)
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
