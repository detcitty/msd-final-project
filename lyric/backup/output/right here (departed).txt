When you feel
Your heart's guarded
And you see
The break started

When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me

Darkchild
You'll be right
Here with me
Oh-oh
You'll be right
Here with me

When you're life
Is going too fast
Off the train tracks
I can slow it down

Just when you think
You bout to turn back
Scared you might crash
I'll be your ground

When you feel
Your heart's guarded
And you see
The break started
When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me
When your tears
Have dried from cryin'
And the world
Has turned to silent
When the clouds
Have all departed
You'll be right
Here with me

I'll be right
Here with you
You'll be right
