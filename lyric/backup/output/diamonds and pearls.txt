This will be the day
That you will hear me say
That I will never run away

I am here for you
Love is meant for two
Now tell me what you're gonna do

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could, I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

Which one of us is right
If we always fight
Why can't we just let love decide?
(Let love decide)

Am I the weaker man
