On the blind side and down the back ways
The roots of sadness crawl,
When you can't get what you need
You feel like taking a torch to it all
All the sweet talk makes a bitter man
You can feel the darkness rise
Sometimes you don't know what you're fighting for
You don't know who it is you despise.
I am the Halleluiah Man
Break all the rules I'm the King of fools
