Ladies and gentlemen
Kelly's back

Told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said I told y'all I was gonna bump like this (uh-uh)
Turn around then I make it jump like this (Ladies)
You wanna keep that boy that make it jump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See I told y'all y'all was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hits like this

Ladies, drama, leave it home
If he ain't got it right by now scratch him off
They just called me
Said it's about twenty strong
They standing at the door don't wanna take us on
The ring let it go 'bout three months ago
The pain the stressin’
Ain’t in me no more
The girl that they used to know done changed
Now they sayin' Ms. before they reachin' my name

Told y'all I was gonna bump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could bump like this
Said I told y'all I was gonna bump like this (uh-uh)
Turn around then I make it jump like this (Ladies)
You wanna keep that boy that make it jump like this
Y'all didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See I told y'all y'all was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hits like this
