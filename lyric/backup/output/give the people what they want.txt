You got to give the people, now
Give the people what they want
Well, well, well, well

No, don't know you
You got to give the people
Give the people what they want?

But I done been all over the world
And everybody feels the same
It's a unanimous decision
I said they're ready for a change, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't know you
Got to give the people, give it up
Give the people what they want?
Well, well

No, don't know? You don't know, no
Got to give the people
Well, well
Give the people what they want

Well, it's about time for things to get better
We want the truth, the truth and no more lies
