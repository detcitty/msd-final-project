Hamburger
And my name is Big Boy
And I love a hamburger
That's nice and juicy

A hamburger that gets on
Everything and everybody
A burger with nice, soft
Warm browm buns

Covered with mustard and relish
And ketchup dripping on down
Lots of onions and mayonnaise

What's that you said, honey
Hold the pickle
Hold the lettuce
Say, baby, hold your mouth
I want it my way

And if you want my way
All you got to do is
Mmm, take my hand
Come with me, baby
To Burger Land
