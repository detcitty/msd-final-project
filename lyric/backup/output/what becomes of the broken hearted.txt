As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
Happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come tumbling down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
