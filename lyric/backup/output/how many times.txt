Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down
How many times I gotta?
Light another for the bitches who's just only in town

For the weekend, ohh

How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time
You know how I feel about waiting in line
You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time
You'll only ditch him for a moment in time, take it in stride
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?

How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?

I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times?

How many times I gotta tell your ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell you I gotta chauffeur?
Think about it, think it over, everything is gon' be kosher
Call me when you getting closer
If you take a taxi, how much I owe ya?
Don't send me no naked pictures
If I can't get naked with ya

This dick deserve recognition
I don't mind paying that commission

Is you with the shit or nah?
If we ain't fucking then bitch, bon voyage
How many times? I said how many times?
