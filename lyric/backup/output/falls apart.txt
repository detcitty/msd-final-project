She falls apart by herself
No ones there to talk or understand
Feels sustained, dries here eyes
Finds herself, opens the door inside
People see right through you
Everyone who knew you well
Falls apart, might as well
Day is long and nothing is wasted

Runaway runaway
(Runaway runaway)
Hold, hold you but you're going away
Runaway runaway

(Runaway runaway)
(Want)
Hold you tomorrow but you're leaving today
(Want)
