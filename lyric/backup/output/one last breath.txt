Please come now, I think I'm falling
But I'm holding on to all
I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say, let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinking maybe six feet

Ain't so far down

I'm looking down now that it's over
