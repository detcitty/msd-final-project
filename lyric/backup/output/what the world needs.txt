I look around at all the faces and I see
All the lonely people looking back at me
Rich, poor don't matter we're all the same
Everybody's hungry in a different way

We're clawin' and climbin' and kickin'
And screamin' and fightin' but really

What the world needs now is love
Love and only love
A little help from up above
Faith to make a better day

Let's come together
Lay our differences down
Spread it all around
That's what the world needs now

Sometimes all it takes is just a smile
