Can I have this dance my you're looking pretty
Is there something wrong did he leave you hurting
I don't mean to pry but that tear in your eye gave you away
If you don't want to talk we'll keep it quiet
But sometimes a heartache hurts worse if you hide it
I think there's a chance one slow dance might ease the pain
