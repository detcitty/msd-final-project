And when the morning comes and you gotta get up
How you going to find your shoes
In an empty bed with an achin' head
You know it's got to give you the blues

I don't know what's going on here
I know things are not all right
If you want me to I'll go dear
If you want, I'll stay all night

I came here with my broken heart
Wrapped away with care
And all you do is sit and drink
And stare at your TV

And when the morning comes and you gotta get up
