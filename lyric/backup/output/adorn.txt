These lips
Can't wait to taste your skin
Baby, no, no
And these eyes, yeah
Can't wait to see your grin
ooh ooh baby
Just let my love
Just let my love adorn you
Please baby, yeah

You gotta know
You gotta know

You know that I adore you
Yeah baby

Baby these fists, uh
Will always protect ya, lady
And this mind
Oh, will never neglect you
Yeah, baby
Oh, oh, baby
And they stay trying to break us down
