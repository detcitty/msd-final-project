Words and music by Jerry Edmonton

I was feelin' so bad 'bout my best friend
I could swear the sky was fallin'
He had them put-down blues from wond'rin
Who his old lady was callin'.

I said, "Keep your life and drown your sorrow
And survive the fire that burns you
If you just slow down and cool your temper
You might get off on what I'll tell ya."

I got me a straight shootin' woman
