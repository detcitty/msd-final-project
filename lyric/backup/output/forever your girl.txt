Hey baby, 'sup, cool
You got remember
I'm forever your girl
Baby forever... and ever and ever
(You know I love you)

Baby pick your head up
Come on and look me in the face
'Cuz I can tell that somethin'
Is bringin' you down
(Why are you down?)

Is it the rumor
That another boy
Wants to take your place?

(I hear he's after your heart)
Have you been hearin' the stories?
They're goin' around
(All of my friends are talkin')

Baby just remember I gave you my heart
Ain't no one gonna tear us apart
He could promise the moon
And the stars above
Even if he promised me the world
