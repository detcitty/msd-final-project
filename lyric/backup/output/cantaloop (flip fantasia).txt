Ladies and Gentlemen, as you know we have something special for you at
Birdland this evening.
A recording for Blue Note Records

What's that? yeah yeah yeah
funky funky, how bout a big hand now?
wait, wait a minute

Groovy groovy jazzy funky pounce bounce dance as we
Dip in the melodic sea, the rhythm keeps flowin, it drips to MC
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks it pops ya dont stop
Till the sweet beat drops
I show and prove as a stick in move
