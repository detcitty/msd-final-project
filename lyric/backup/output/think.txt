Think about it.
Think about it.
Think about it.

Think!

Imagine if I said I sometimes need you
I need you to this day
Imagine if I said I sometimes hear you call my name
Imagine if I said I still could love you
Imagine what youâ€™d say
Imagine if I said I sometimes still can see your face

Think about all the things we shared
Think about all the times we cared
