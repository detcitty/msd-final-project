(and when morning comes)...
up all night, sleep all day
up all night, sleep all day
(musical interlude)
When evenin comes
i am alive
i love to prowl around in the streets
Its the moonlight
that controls my mind
now i've got the power to speak, yeah
(awake from dusk to dawn)
under the city lights
(stars are shinin down)
theyll be shinin down on you and i
(and when morning comes)
i'll hold you till the mornin light
everybody sing it now
Up all night
sleep all day
up all night
