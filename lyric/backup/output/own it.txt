It's yours
It's yours

Yours
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is?
It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin', wake up with me this weekend, weekend
Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
