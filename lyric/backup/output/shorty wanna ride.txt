Shorty Wanna Ride With Me, Ride With Me
We Can Get Low, Hop Into The Chevy 4 Door
Blow Dro, Wanna Ride With Me, Ride With Me
Let Ya Hair Down, You Said You Wanna Thug
Don't Be Scared Now

Shorty Wanna Ride With Me, Ride With Me
We Can Get Low, Hop Into The Chevy 4 Door
Blow Dro, Wanna Ride With Me, Ride With Me
Let Ya Hair Down, You Said You Wanna Thug
Don't Be Scared Now
Shorty Wanna Ride With Me, Ride With Me

My 24's Spinnin', The Sticker's Still On 'Em
The Same Ol' Hoes, But A Nigga Still Want 'Em
I'm Parkin Lot Pimpin' On Another Nigga Woman
She Pullin Up Her Skirt, Tryin Show A Nigga Sumthin
Ya' Car Cloudy, My Niggas All Rowdy
This Heinesy Got A Nigga Drowsy, I'm Outty
Now Where Them Hoes At, Look I'm Tryin To Take You Home
So What'cha Got Ya Girlfriends, Bitch Bring 'Em On
Hoe I'm Tryin To Break A Bone, When I Get In Them Draw's
To The Window, To The Muthafuckin Walls
What A Nigga Don't Know Wont Hurt Him'
So If Ya' Got A Old Man, Bitch I Ain't Worried
And I Got Plenty Room If Ya Think You Wanna Roll
See This Is What They Make Caddillac Trucks For
Let's Go To A Place You Ain't Never Been, Down In The Country
I Bet Ya, I Have Ya Sayin' Ya Love Me
