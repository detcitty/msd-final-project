We're j.j. fad and we're here to rock
rhymes like ours could never be stopped
see, there's three of us and i know we're fresh
party rockers, non-stoppers, and our names are def
see, the 'j' is for just, the other for jammin'
the 'f' is for fresh, 'a' and 'd' def
behind the turntables is dj train
mixin' and scratchin' is the name of the game
now here's a little somethin' 'bout nosy people
it's not real hard, it's plain and simple
baby-d

'cause when he cuts to the beat it sounds this way
