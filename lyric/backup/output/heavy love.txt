You left a yearning, in my heart
And I can't soothe it, naw, naw, baby
I can't find another thrill, strong enough to remove it
This HEAVY LOVE
It's too high to get over, naw
It's too deep to get under, naw
It's too wide to get around
And it's weighing me down
This HEAVY LOVE, oooweee, baby
It's too high to get over
Watch out you might drown
(Too deep to get under)
It's too deep to get under, baby
It's too wide to get around
And it's weighing me down
Oh why, tell me why
Have I been condemned to love only you
Why, tell me why
Can't I spread my wings and fly above you
To the world beyond

These memories that cloud my mind
I can't erase them - I've tried hard, baby
