Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown, bound

Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
