I know the desert can't hold all the love
That I feel in my heart for you, yeah
If I could spread it out across the sea
I know my love would cork it up

Ain't that a lot of love
For one heart to hold?

If the bees only knew how sweet you are, baby
They would seal up their honey comb
If the birds could hear how sweet your voice is
They would tighten up the song

Ain't that a lot of love
