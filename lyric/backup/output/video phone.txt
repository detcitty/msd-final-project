Shawty, what your name is?
Them hustlas keep on talkin'
They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me
So press record, I'll let you film me

On your video phone, make a cameo
Tape me on your video phone, I can handle you
Watch me on your video phone, on your video, video
If you want me, you can watch me on your video phone

I love how you approach me
Fresh white with your pants hangin' grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
No need to convince me anymore

Swag up, it's bright, one blade, it's tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby you doin' something right
You just canceled every other man here

You say you like my bag and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'ma leave my number on your video phone

I got no time for frontin'
I know just what I'm wantin'
If it's gonna be you and me
When I call, they better see me on your video screen
