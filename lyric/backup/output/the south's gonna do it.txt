Well, the train to Grinderswitch is runnin' right on time
And the Tucker boys are cookin' down in Carolin'
People down in Florida can't be still
When old Lynyrd Skynyrd's pickin' down in Jacksonville
And people down in Georgia come from near and far
To hear Richard Betts pickin' on that red guitar

So gather round
