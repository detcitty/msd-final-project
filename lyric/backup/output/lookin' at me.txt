Hey yo Mase, you know what I don't like?
(Why you over there lookin' at me)
I don't like when, you know, I'm in a club
(Why you over there lookin' at me)
And I'm with my honey
(Why you over there lookin' at me)
You got, you know, the haters
They wanna be tough guys all of the sudden

Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here
Why you over there lookin' at me
While my girl standin' here
Dig?
Now what the hell is you lookin' for?
Can't a young man get money anymore?
Let my pants sag down to the floor
Really do it matter as long as I score?
Can't my car look better than yours?
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to see me without no drawers
In a stretch Lex with about ten doors?
I was Murda
P. Diddy made me pretty
Did it for the money, now can you get with me?
People wanna know who is he, he get busy
Spray so much izzy, girls get dizzy
