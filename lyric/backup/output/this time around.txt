It's getting colder in this ditch where I lie
I'm feeling older and I'm wondering why
I heard they told her it was tell and live or die
I didn't know her but I know why she lied
I didn't know her but I know why she died
Yeah

chorus
You can't say I didn't give it
I won't wait another minute
We're on our way this time around
Whoa yeah
You can't say I didn't give it
I won't wait another minute
We're on our way this time around
