Whenever I'm dressed cool, my parents put up a fight
And if I'm hot shot, mom will cut my hair at night
And in the morning, I'm short of my identity
I scream Mom and Dad:
"Why can't I be who I wanna be?"
To be

I just wanna be myself
And I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself
And I want you to know I am my hair

I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair

I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fighting to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear

I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair
