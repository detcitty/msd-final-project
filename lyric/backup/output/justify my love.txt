Y-e-a-h...
I wanna kiss you in Paris
I wanna hold your hand in Rome
I wanna run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross country
You put this in me
So now what?
So now what?
Wanting needing waiting
For you to justify my love
(my love) Hoping
(my love) Praying
For you to justify my love
(moaning)
Okay
