Bag lady you goin' hurt your back
Draggin' all 'em bags like that
I guess nobody ever told you
All you must hold on to
Is you, is you, is you

One day all 'em bag goin' get in your way
One day all 'em bag goin' get in your way
I said
One day all 'em bag goin' get in your way
One day all 'em bag goin' get in your way

So
(Pack light, pack light)
Hmm, mmm
(Pack light, pack light)
(Ooh, ooh)

Bag lady, you goin' miss your bus
You can't hurry up
'Cause you got too much stuff
When they see you comin'
Niggaz take off runnin'
From you it's true
Ohh, yes they dooo

One day he gonna say you crowdin' my space
One day he gonna say you crowdin' my space
I said
