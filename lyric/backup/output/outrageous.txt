Outrageous, when I move my body
Outrageous, when I'm at a party
Outrageous, in my sexy jeans
Outrageous, when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we're on a world tour
Outrageous, that's B-girl

I'm sexy as I wanna be
Got these fellas chasin' me
It's about time I hit the streets
All my girls still feelin' me
B girl ain't lost the beat
Jumped over drama and I landed on my feet
Gotta keep goin' no stoppin' me
And if you don't like it then

Media over here
Come through like a world premiere
Trench coat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show it's
