There's only two ways out of here
You're way too late, you'll be traped here forever
There's only two ways out of here
One's through the door, the other is through me

Sometimes livin' in a world like this
It's pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you don't comply
Pretty easy if you don't complain

Stand there like you don't feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend to the end that you don't feel change
Don't admit that your faith is weak

Don't say that you feel like dyin'
Life's hard and it feels like diamonds
Go home, shit's far too gone
Much too late to even feel like tryin'

Can't understand what I'm sayin'
Can't figure out what I'm implyin'
If you feel you don't wanna be alive
You feel just how I am
