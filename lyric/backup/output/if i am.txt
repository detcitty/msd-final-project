So you're standing on a ledge
It looks like you might fall
So far down
Or maybe you were thinking about jumping

Now you could have it all
If you learned a little patience
For though I cannot fly
I'm not content to crawl

To give me a little credit
Have in me a little faith
I want to be with you forever
If tomorrow's not too late

But it's always too late when you got nothing
So you say
