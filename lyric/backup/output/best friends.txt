Who's my number one girl!?
Who's my number one girl!?

Where she go?
Where she at?
That's my girl, got my back
When I need her, always there
Hold me down, like no one else
Stupid boys come around
Me and my girls shut 'em down
Nobody can stop us now,
Gonna take 'em, we run this town
Oh, no no

If you got a friend like that, like that
Like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that
Like that, like that
You got a friend like that, like that
Like that, like that
