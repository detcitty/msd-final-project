Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road

Well, there may be times
When you think
You've lost your mind
And the steps you're taken
Leave you three full steps behind

Just you keep on keeping on
The road that you choose
Don't you give up walking
Cause you gave up shoes

Come on, ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down the road

Don't you carry nothing
