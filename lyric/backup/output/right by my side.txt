It all comes, down to this
I miss your morning kiss
I won't lie, I'm feeling it
You're gone now, and I missing it
I'm so dumb, I must admit
It's too much, to hold it in
I can't say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now

Gotta let you know, how I'm feeling
You own my heart, hes just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart oh boy

I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right
I'm not livin'
If you're not by my side
Ohhhhhhhhhh

I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right
I'm not livin'
If you're not by my side
Ohhhhhhhhhh
