She says she's love my lolly
She wanna make it pop
She says she's love my lolly
She wanna kiss the top
She says she's love my lolly
She love my lollipop
She says she's love my lolly
She says she's love my lolly

She say she love to party, girl, I love your body
Why you on the table? Cause you know I'm watching
She say she love my molly, so we can leave this party
And go back to my hotel, and don't stop the Hibachi
Don't stop in the lobby, I hope you massage me
I hope you can take it when I make you call me papi
Club about to close, come up out them clothes
I'm about to give you what you asking for

Order what you want girl, it ain't no problem
I'mma tell the waitress that my baby need a bottle
Order what you want, said it ain't no problem
Got a piece of candy and it's all for you

She says she's love my lolly
She wanna make it pop
She says she's love my lolly
She wanna kiss the top
She says she's love my lolly
She love my lollipop
She says she's love my lolly
