Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

Look at that anatomy
The sweetest thing
That could ever be
Heaven knows
She was made for me
It's the closest thing
To perfect that I've ever seen

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

She's the closest thing
To perfect that I've ever seen

Ooh, she's an ideal lady
That, she's so well-defined
Ooh, she's drivin' me crazy
She's got those long legs streamlined
