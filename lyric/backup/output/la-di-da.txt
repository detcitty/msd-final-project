How come every time we meet
You get lots of little people running round at your feet
You're the centre of attention in the cafes and the bars
Everybody treats you like a superstar
Then again I know who you are
You're taking it too far
Wild nights and parties in the hills of Hollywood
And all the papers tell me that you're doing pretty good
They tell me the way you hang round
With the guys in their leathers and chains
