It's down to this
I've got to make this life make sense
Can anyone tell what I've done
I miss the life
I miss the colors of the world
Can anyone tell where I am

'Cause now again I've found myself
So far down
Away from the sun that shines into
The darkest place
I'm so far down
Away from the sun again

Away from the sun again

I'm over this
I'm tired of living in the dark
