Hey, Nikita is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know

Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow

Oh, Nikita you will never know, anything about my home
