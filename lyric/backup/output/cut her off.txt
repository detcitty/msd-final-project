Them boys wearing fake belts
They drink fake lean

Niggas smoking synthetic, huh

Bitches dropping like, swish, Ricky Pitino
50 racks on the corner, think it's casino
Hoes thinking I'm boojie, when I'm smoking on gucci
All my shoes be Gucci, I got a mill for Lil Boosie
Double M on the rise, duct tape on my pistol

So you won't be surprised, it's time to make this official
Got a bitch on the East, got a bitch on the West

When I'm eating the box, I let her sit on my chest
You know I love her a lot, she let me fuck on my yacht
Rolling dice with my niggas, a half a ticket, the pot
I blew a brick out in Reno, Uncle Paulie casino
Niggas shot up my car, walk away like Benzino
Percocets for myself, I feel a hundred degrees
Niggas getting that money, bust it down with your team
From the Chevy to Bentley, from the Bentley to Rolls
It may seem like we do, we never loving them hoes
