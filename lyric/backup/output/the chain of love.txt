He was driving home one evening,
in his beat up Pontiac.
When an old lady flagged him down;
Her Mercedes had a flat.
He could see that she was frightened,
Standing out there in the snow.
'Till he said "I'm here to help you ma'am,
By the way, my name's Joe."

She said, "I'm from St. Louis",
And I'm only passing through,
I must've seen a hundred cars go by,
This is awful nice of you."

When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk,
And was about to drive away,
She said, "How much do I owe you?"
