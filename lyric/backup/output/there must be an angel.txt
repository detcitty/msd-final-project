No one on earth could feel like this
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss
There must be an Angel
Playing with my heart

I walk into an empty room
And suddenly my heart goes boom
It's an orchestra of Angels
And they're playing with my heart

Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel

Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel

Must be talking to an Angel
Must be talking to an Angel
