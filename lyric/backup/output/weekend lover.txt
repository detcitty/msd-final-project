Lover, lover
Lover, lover
Lover, lover
Lover, lover

Straight from heaven and the stars above
Came the man I love
But it never did occur to me
That my handsome loverman
Was on a family plan
With a double personality

Sometimes I stop and ask myself
What am I doin', where am I goin'
Sleepin' with a married man
Oh, but when he holds me in his arms
Tells me that I'm his lucky charm
I'm doin' the best I can
