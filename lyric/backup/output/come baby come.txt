Bounce, come on, bounce
Bounce, come on, bounce
Bounce, come on, bounce
Bounce, come on, bounce

I slam the door, boom
When I come into the bedroom, wham bam
'Cause I'm the king of the castle, na na na
Turn me on, turn me loose, come on, come on

Try to hit it, it's a hassle, come get some of this
Don't forget the innuendo, play me like Nintendo
Never ever let go, screaming so loud you'll be hitting the crescendo
Doh ray me fa sol la te doh

Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Well, you gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some
You gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some

Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Come baby come, baby, baby come, come
Well, you gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some
You gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some
