IfULeave"
(feat. Mary J. Blige)

You think
I'm so full of it, full of it
But I think I'm just fed up baby
You think I can be so arrogant, arrogant
But I'm just tryna get keep my head up baby
You think I procrastinate baby
But I think I'm taking my time
You think you need to leave
But I think I disagree but

If you believe you'll do best without me
Ill let it go girl, Its over
But before we say good bye
Lets give it a try
If you leave, then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go girl, Its over
