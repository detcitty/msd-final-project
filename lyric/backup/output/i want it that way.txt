Yeah-eh-heah
you are, my fire,
the one, desire,
believe, when I say

I want it that way
But we, are two worlds apart,
can't reach to your heart,
when you say,

that I want it that way
Tell me why,
ain't nothin' but a heartache,
tell me why,
ain't nothin' but a mistake,
tell me why,
I never wanna hear you say,
