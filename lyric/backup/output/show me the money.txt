This is definitely the wickedest thing I ever hear in my life!
Show off that body you got
You got the dance, glow so hot
You workin' that, you twerkin' that

You tickin' that like a clock
Can't nobody do it like I do it
When I do it, dog I do it
(Break it down)
Break it down, put your back into it
Man, y'all ain't ready for the I'm doing
(So get up)
Get up, put your drinks down
Don't want y'all sloshing yo' drinks out
All over that cheap blouse
Ain't nothing but a swallow in it anyhow
(Still me)
Still me, I just changed the sound
To the other one I had and just swapped it out

(Switch!)
