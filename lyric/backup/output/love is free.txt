One
Two
One, two, three!

She got a shack
Floating down the Pontchartrain
With the water rolling in
You gotta swim
Before the levees start to crack

Another day
Another dollar down the drain
You go to town
No one's around
Cause if you drown
There ain't no hope for coming back

It ain't no big thing if you lose your faith
They kinda like to keep you in your place
You never know what might be coming your way
