When I took a little loving from you
Oh I, never thought about the hurting inside
But I took a little more than I should
Oh why, can't explain that I would ever
Let you slip through my fingers
Let you escape like yesterday
I would appreciate you knowing
I thought your love had come to stay

Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
When will I learn
Talking out of turn
Shot to pieces
