One of a kind love affair is
The kind of love
That you read about
In a fairy tale
Like the sun that shines
On a rainy day
It's a cloud of love

One of a kind love affair is
When your down is up
When your up is down
But love stays around
And when you know you're right
But you got to make
A little sacrifice
You make it for love
Whoa, yeah

I never thought about today would come
