I hear a voice
In the room next to mine
Feels good, sounds good
Closes the door from behind
And then another voice
Comes through the door

I am dealing with a man
When away from me
Stays deep inside my heart
And he says if anyone falls in love
It will be one of us

If anyone falls in love
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind
If anyone falls
