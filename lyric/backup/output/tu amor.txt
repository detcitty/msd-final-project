Mi amor I'm not sure of the right words to say
Maybe these simple words will the best to best explain
What I feel in my heart
What I feel more each day
How to make you see
How to let you know
How to say how to say
How I love you so
With words you understand
Words that get right through to your heart
Here's the place to start

Tu amor (tu amor)
I will always be
Tu amor (tu amor)
Means the world to me
Estarás siempre en mi corazón
You're the one in my soul
And I live for
