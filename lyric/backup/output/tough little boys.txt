Well I never once, backed down from a punch
Well I'd take it square on the chin
And I found out fast a bully's just that
And you've got to stand up to him

So I didn't cry when I got a black eye
As bad as it hurt I just grinned
But when tough little boys grow up to be dads
They turn into be babies again
