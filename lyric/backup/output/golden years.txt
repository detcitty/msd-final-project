Golden years g-o-l-d
(whop-whop-whop)
Golden years g-o-l-d

(whop-whop-whop)
Golden years g-o-l-d
(whop-whop-whop)
Don't let me hear you say life' taking you nowhere angel
(come get up my baby)
Look at that sky life's begun

Nights are warm and the days are young
(come get up my baby)
There's my baby lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul

Golden years g-o-l-d
(whop-whop-whop)
(come get up my baby)
Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings angel
(come get up my baby)
