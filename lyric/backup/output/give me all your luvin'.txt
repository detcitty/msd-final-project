L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna
I see you coming and I don't wanna know your name

L-U-V, Madonna
I see you coming and you're gonna have to change the game
Y-O-U, you wanna

Would you like to try?
Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got

Maybe you'll do fine
As long as you don't lie to me
And pretend to be what you're not

Don't play the stupid game
Cause I'm different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same

You've got to step into my world
Give me all your love and give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your love and give me your love
Let's forget about time
