We don't want it
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want it neva

We don't want it neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't want it neva end
We don't want

We don't want it neva end
We don't want

I could tell you was into me, from my instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
I'll go to war over you I don't give a fuck about showing you
You know what it is, Shorty, forever my lil shawty
Long as I'm swimmin' in Benjamins, you shop with no limited
You'll see reminisce every session, know you'll come back again
