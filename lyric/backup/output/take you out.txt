Yeah yeah
Here it is

She caught me by suprised I must say
Cause I never had seen such a pretty face
With such a warm and beatiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style
I was fasinated surly
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say

Excuse me miss (YEHHH)
But whats your name?
Where are you from and can I come?
And possibly can i take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park (YEHHH)
I'll have you home before it's dark (WHOOOO)
So let me know, can I take you out tonight?

Don't care if i get rejected
