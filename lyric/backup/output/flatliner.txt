Dang, girl, look at you
stopping me in my boots
what's a country boy to do, buy say
uh uh

Stop beating my chest up
You're down right dangerous
That shake got me gitty up
Got my eyes goin' what what

Sippin on this seven-seven
never been this close to heaven
Got the pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' them dead on the dance floor
Sombody better call a doctor
She's a litter heart stopper
I'm Talkin' breaker breaker one-niner
