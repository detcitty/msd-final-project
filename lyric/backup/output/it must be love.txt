Must be love
it must be love, talkin? bout love
must be love
it must be love, talkin? bout love
Something? s got me upside down
and i never been like this before
something? s got me goin? in and out
and i never moved like this before
Something? s glowin? round my eyes
and i never looked like this before (oh, no, no, no, no, no)
something? s brought this girl to life
and i never felt like this before
and i? m sure that was something that happened to me
