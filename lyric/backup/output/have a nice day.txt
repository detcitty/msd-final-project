Why you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived a lie, it's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away

Ooh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life

Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
