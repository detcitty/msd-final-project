I don't want you to come round here no more
I beg you for mercy
You don't know how strong my weakness is
Or how much it hurts me

'Cause when you said it over with him
I want to believe it's true
So I let you in knowing tomorrow
I'm gonna wake up missing you, wake up missing you

When the one you love's in love with someone else
