My president is black my mayback too
And I'll be goddamned if my diamonds ain't blue
My moneys dark green and my porche is light gray
I'm headed for DC anybody feel me

My president is black in fact hes half white
So even in a racist mind he's half right
If you got a racist mind you'll be aight
My president is black but his house is all white
Rosa parks sat so martin luther could walk
Martin luther walked so barack obama could run
Barack obama ran so all the children could fly
I'm a spread my wings you can meet me in the sky
I already got my own clothes already got my own shoes
I was hot before barack imagine what I'm gon do
Hello miss america hey pretty lady
Red white and blue flag
Wave for me baby
I never thought id say this shit
Baby I'm good
You can keep ya puss I don't want no more bush
No more war no more iraq no more white lies
The president is black

My president is black my mayback too
And I'll be goddamned if my diamonds ain't blue
My moneys dark green and my porche is light gray
I'm headed for DC anybody feel me

Today was a good day, hope I have me a great night
I don't know what you fishin for but catch you a great white
Me, I see great white, heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this, who knew it came in bails
Who knew what came with jail, who knew what came with prison
Just cause you got opinions, does that make you a politician?
Bush robbed all of us, would that make him a criminal?
And then he cheated in Florida, would that make him a seminal?
I say and I quote, "We need a miracle"
