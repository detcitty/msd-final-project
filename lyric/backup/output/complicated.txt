I'm so scared that the way that I feel
Is written all over my face
When you walk into the room
I wanna find a hiding place
We used to laugh, we used to hug,
The way that old friends do
But now I smile at a touch of your hand
Just makes me come unglued,

Such a contradiction,
Do I lie or tell the truth,
Is it fact or fiction,
Oh the way I feel for you

It's so complicated
I'm so frustrated
