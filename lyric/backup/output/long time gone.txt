Daddy sits on the front porch swingin'
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley tobacco
Now he knows it never will
My brother found work in Indiana
Sister's a nurse at the old folks' home
Mama's still cooking too much for supper
And me, I been a long time gone

Been a long time gone
No I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't comin' back again

Delia plays that old church piano
Sittin' out on her daddy's farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord, I never meant to do her harm
