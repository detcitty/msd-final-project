Somebody told me a long long time ago
Baby, I feel the change in me is comin' on
I've found the strength I need to carry on
Something's come over me at last

Ooh, sweet darlin'
Long as you stay by me, I'm halfway home
I can see brighter days before me
Though it's been stormy, at least I know I'm not alone
