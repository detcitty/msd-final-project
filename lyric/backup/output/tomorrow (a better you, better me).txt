I hope tomorrow will bring better you, better me
I know that we'll show this world we got more we could be
So you should never give up on your hopes and your dreams
You gotta get up, get out, get into it, get it on to be strong

If we try we can fly to a whole another place
All we need is relief and a smile on our face
We can go anywhere we want, any road we decide to take
And we're never, never, never too far from tomorrow, today

If tomorrow is light in a place where there's no home
Then know that now is the time to have faith in us all
