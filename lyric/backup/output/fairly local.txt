I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm evil to the core, What I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional, What I want to save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am?, I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat, And repeat yesterday's dance
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
