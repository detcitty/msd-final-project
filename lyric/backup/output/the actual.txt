"No... no doubt baby... All City TRUE...
Ready to flip shit, comin' through with the crew" [x4]

Yeah, what, uh
Like that how we do
The N-Y
Bed-Stuy
Brooklyn

[Verse 1:]

Check it
For you to fuck with this apostle, it's not possible
Mega large collossal nigga you docile
And I sizable play me close and I'll ox you
That's only logical cause I'm fact, you costume
Now who da obstacle?
Throw basic, watch me blaze shit, The All's faced it
It's natural for champs to hate shit
Plenty cases, some anonymous, age m-i-n-t,
with a diamond glist, like jewelery
You hold on, you'll see, if it kill me
All City, bound to be rich, without the filthy
My players skillt me, your glares don't tilt me
My pops def' built to the point
I'm not moved by no thing
Man or material, crime without the serial
never been inside, unless it was a V.I.
Although they got plans to knock me
I feel 'em watchin' me, eyein' the city while we monopoly
