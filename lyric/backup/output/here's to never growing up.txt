Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boom box blaring as we're falling in love
I got a bottle of whatever
but it's getting us drunk
Singing here's to never growing up

Call up all our friends
go hard this weekend
For no damn reason
I don't think we'll ever change
Meet you at the spot
half past ten o'clock
We don't ever stop
and we're never gonna change

Say, won't you say forever stay
If you stay forever hey
We can stay forever young

Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boom box blaring as we're falling in love
I got a bottle of whatever
but it's getting us drunk
Singing, here's to never growing up

We'll be running down the street
yelling "Kiss my ass!"
I'm like yeah whatever
we're still living like that
