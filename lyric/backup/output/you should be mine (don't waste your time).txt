Mase and Brian McKnight, Bay Boy we don't stop
Yo, I hit you with the sound that the world can't take
Came straight out the gig playing two point eight
Near studded, jewel flooded, got to love it
First rap cat with an R n' B budget

Everyday on the TV, me and PD
Girls see PD, make their man break the CD
Why ya'll forever rowdy, I'll be outie
Somewhere in Maui, 'til I go back to Cali

Can't understand how he can treat you
The way that he does
Give me the chance to show you baby
You're better off with me

Oh so baby let me try, I wanna make you smile
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
I'll never let you down, I'll always be around
And you should be mine
