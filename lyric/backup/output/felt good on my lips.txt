Said her name was a hand me down name
From the side of a family that long ago came
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess.
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips.

She tipped the DJ to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was a rockin' on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said lets go and get it on
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it
I don't know what it meant but it felt good on my lips.
