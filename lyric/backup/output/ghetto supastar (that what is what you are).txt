Man, man look up at the sky
All the stars man, the stars look beautiful tonight
Look at 'em
Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin' from afar, reachin' for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh, huh
From one corner to another, uh, huh
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means
The supreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin' raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floatin' on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me? I hated those who doubt me
A million refugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top skeezers
Diplomatic legalese, no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me, somethin' like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin' bygones be bygones and so on and so on
I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin' it retrospective from the get-go
