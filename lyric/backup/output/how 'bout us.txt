Ooh, short and sweet
No sense in draggin' on past our needs
Let's don't keep it hangin' on
If the fire's out, we should both be gone
Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life, how 'bout us?
Some people can hold it together
Last through all kinds of weather, can we?
Now don't get me wrong
(what are you saying to me baby)
'Cause I'm not tryin' now to end it all
(let's start something new)
It's just that I have seen
(what have you seen?)
Too many lover's hearts lose their dreams
