We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
Millennium

Some say that we are players
Some say that we are pawns
But we've been makin' money
Since the day that we were born
Got to slow down (slow down)
'Cause we're low down

Run around in circles
Live a life of solitude
Until we find ourselves a partner
Someone to relate to
Got to slow down (Slow down)
Before we fall down
