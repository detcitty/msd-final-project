take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take it
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Bring me up to pull me down

Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take it
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
You're the one to push me over

I've never what you really needed
You won't stop you can't stop can't let go
Everybody knows
