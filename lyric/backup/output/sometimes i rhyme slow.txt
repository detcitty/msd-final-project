(greg nice)
Sometimes i rhyme slow sometimes i rhyme quick

I'm sweeter and thicker than a chico stick
Here's an ice cream cone honey take a lick
I go to bay plaza and catch a flick
Wore my timberland boots so i can stomp ticks
Scandalous get a wiff of this mist
Just like the yar boys now i'm blissed
I feel good per say good state of mind
Drive a red sterling and the seats recline

I love it when a lady treats me kind
Go to tavern on the green have a glass of wine
