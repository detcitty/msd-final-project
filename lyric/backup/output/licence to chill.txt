(Yeah yeah)
(Yeah Billy, yo Billy)
(Way to go Billy)

Oh feelin', can't stop this feelin', oh no
The perfect lover
Oh, that's what you are, baby
I'm in Heaven
You take me to Heaven, oh
Fly like an Angel
Be my lucky star, baby, ooh

(I want to get up and on and on)
Transmission's on and up we go, oh
(I want to get up and drive you higher)
Imagination high, my resistance low, yo

And all you gotta do is say
(Yeah Billy, go Billy, way to go)
And don't you worry, it's alright
(It's all right)
Let me tell you
(Why Billy, now Billy, gimme all you got)
It's so exciting and so right
(So right)

Ohh oh, oh don't stop what you doin' to me
'Cause girl I'm hot and I'm ready to please
