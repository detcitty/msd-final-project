When I walked in the band just started
The singer couldn't carry a tune in a bucket.
Was on a mission to drown her memory but
I thought no way with all this ruckus.

But after one round with Jose Cuervo
I caught my boots tappin 'long with the beat.
And after two rounds with Jose Cuervo
That band was sounding pretty darn good to me.
