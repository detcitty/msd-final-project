Yeah

All that style
All going to waste
All that beauty
But you never show your face

I'm gonna make my way to you
Knock down your door and walk on through
I'm impatient, times a wastin'
Girl, if you give me an occasion

I'm gonna rise to it
You know I really can do it
I'm gonna rise, I'm gonna rise, I'm gonna rise to it
