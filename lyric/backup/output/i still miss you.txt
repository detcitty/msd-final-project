I've changed the presets in my truck,
So those old songs don't sneak up,
But they still find me and remind me.
Yeah, you come back that easy.

Try restaurants I've never been to,
Order new things off the menu
That I never tried, cause you didn't like,
Two drinks in, you were by my side.

()
I've talked to friends,
Talked to myself,
I've talked to God,
I prayed liked hell,
But I still miss you.

I've tried sober, I've tried drinking.
I've been strong, and I've been weak,
And I still miss you.
