In the light of the sun
Is there anyone?
Oh, it has begun

Oh, dear, you look so lost
Your eyes are red when tears are shed
The world you must have crossed, you said

You don't know me, you don't even care
Oh yeah, you said
You don't know me, and you don't wear my chains
Oh yeah

Essential yet appealed
Carry all your thoughts
