She's got the answers
She waves them like a flag
She'll take all the cards from the Soho League
And stick them in her bag for security
Baby likes her fever
Well, she'll take it all night long
Around the track with the red-eyed Jacks
And nothin' she can do can be that wrong

Don't fight it, don't fight it
You've been on the ropes too long
Don't fight it, don't fight it
Nothing she does can be wrong

She's got her reasons
And she wields them like a knife
But she'll take her stand in the underground band
She doesn't know that she's in there for life
