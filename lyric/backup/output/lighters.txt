This ones for you and me living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters,
a sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this, I woulda already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards f*ck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put you lighters up, point them skyward, uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up still king
Rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'til nobody else even f*ckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the f*ckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses
Excuse me, if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip d*ck you did opposite
You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell them shove it cause it wasn't that
Long ago when Marshall sat flustered, lacked luster
