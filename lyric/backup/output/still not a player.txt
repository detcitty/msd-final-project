whoahhaoohhH! Yeahheahhaa
Don't wanna beeeee a playahh (T.S.)

I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin for
For my thugs, for my thugs
Uptown baby, uptown
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be - I don't wanna be a playa no more
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
But you know Big Punisher still down by law
Who's down to crush a lot

Hey yo I'm still not a playa but you still a hater
Elevator to the top hah, see you later, I'm gone
Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
