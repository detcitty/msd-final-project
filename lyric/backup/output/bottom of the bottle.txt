Da, na, na, na, na
Yeah no s**t, no s**t

(August Alsina)
Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle
Drop it down low, bring it up real slow
Bout to go down, make me say oh no
Body like a model, booty so colossal
I wanna grip her like the bottom of the bottle
Drop it down low, bring it up real slow
Bout to go down, make me say oh no
Drop it down low, bring it up slow, yo, yo

Drop it down low, bring it up slow, yo, yo

(Curren$y)
Uh, back in it, it been a minute
Here she go with all that where you been at?
I been at it, tryna get it
Gotta admit it, I look good with it
You would look good sitting in my car when I start the engine
Left an impression on her greater than my grand entrance
Now she wrapped up in that jet living
Imagining herself in the wifey position
Naked under aprons in the kitchen while I'm blazing something amazing
Plan the next mission, she share my dollar sign vision
