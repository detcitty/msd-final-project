I stood outside the Lucky Star staring at the flashing sign
It read, 'Come on in and watch young Scarlet's body come alive'
Let her dance for you and cast her spell
You'll swear you can believe her
Be careful not to catch that scarlet fever

So I paid my fare and walked down front and found an empty chair
As I settled in young Scarlet took the ribbons from her hair
