Why don't you dream anymore
What's in the way
How come you point to the door
And ask me to stay-ay
Why don't you flash that smile
Like you used to do
Why don't you stay for awhile
Uh well it's up to you, cause
You are the girl
That keeps me up at night
You are the girl
That makes me feel all right
You are the girl
Well you give me a twirl
You are the girl
In my dreams

Why don't ya talk anymore
