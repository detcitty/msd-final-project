I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
I hit the baddest chicks
Shorty don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you maaagic
(What? What?) Maaagic
I got the magic stick
I'm a freak to the core
Get a dose once, you gon' want some more
My tongue touch ya girl, ya toes bound to curl

This exclusive shit I don't share with the world
I have you up early in the mornin, moanin
Back shot, proper or low can't stop us
Been a fiend for this since Rakim made hits
Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch
I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I skeet it up, straight beat it up.

. and I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n

I'm in the telly workin up a sweat strokin
Tonight's the night, you can fall in love
You can call your mama right now, tell her you met a thug
I pop a lot of shit cause I can back it up
