It's you that I adore
You'll always be my whore
You'll be a mother to my child
And a child to my heart

We must never be apart
We must never be apart
Lovely girl, you're the beauty in my world
Without you, there aren't reasons left to find

And you'll pull your crooked teeth
You'll be perfect just like me
