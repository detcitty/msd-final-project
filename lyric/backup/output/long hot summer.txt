can't sleep, ain't no sleep a-coming
I'm just lying here thinking 'bout you
I'm in deep, falling deep into the picture
In my mind of everything we're gonna do

Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Wanna jump in my car, go wherever you are
'Cause I need you by my side

It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound

And when you say my name in the middle of the day
