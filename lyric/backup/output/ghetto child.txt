When I was seventeen
I ran away from home and from everything
I had ever known

I was sick and tired
Living in a town
Filled with narrow minds and hate

They used to laugh at me
The children called me names
I would ran and hide
Feelin' so ashamed just for being born
I was just a boy punished for a crime
That was not mine

Life ain't so easy
When you're a ghetto child
Oh baby,
Life ain't so easy
