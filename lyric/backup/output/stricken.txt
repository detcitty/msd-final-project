You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time

You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason
I know that I am Stricken and can't let you go
