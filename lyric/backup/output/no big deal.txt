(Pack)

Rock it and roll!

You know it's easy to say,
"Get out and go your own way,"
But baby, why don't you just stay all night?

You're such a sweet young roller skater
And I could easily see you later
If you'd just tell me that it's all right

Because you can make love for the first time
You can be yourself, it ain't no crime
You can walk around on such a fine line
Anything you want to, baby
That's all right with me
