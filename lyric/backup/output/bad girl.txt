Something's missing and I don't know why
I always feel the need to hide my feelings... from you
Is it me, or you that I'm afraid of
I tell myself, I'll show you what I'm made of
Can't bring myself to let you go

Don't want to cause you any pain
But I love you just the same
And you'll always be my baby
In my heart, I know we've come apart
And I don't know where to start
What can I do?
I don't wanna feel blue...

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing someone else's lips
Smoked too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy when I act this way

Bad girl, drunk by six
Kissing some kind stranger's lips
Smoke too many cigarettes today
I'm not happy, I'm not happy
