Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky

You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn't around
That I left you alone

Well, look up in the sky
Just look up in the sky
See that I'm everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

Well, well, is that our little author?
Coming back, humming his hymns a little altered
Your attention put back on the flow like the department of water
Taken off of the dough like Little Walter, Chess

Yes, baby I'm Jerry Lawler
Rebel with a cause, outlaw with a lawyer
Judge, jury like Alou, rap name Lupe
