I can't wait
I love you

I can't wait
I can't wait

Sometime she talks to him
Sometimes when she's only dreaming
Then when she wakes up
Somehow she still believes him

Yes, I know you
Know we've been out of touch
Yes, I know you
To be continued, it's too much

Well, I can't wait, I can't wait
Well, if I'm wasting my time, if you make up your mind
Well, I can't wait, I can't wait
