I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all

What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over

'Til it's over
But it's far from over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it

Never drop the ball, fuck it y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?

You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
