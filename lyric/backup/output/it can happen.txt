You can fool yourself
You can cheat until you're blind
You can cut your heart
It can happen
You can mend the wires
You can feed the soul apart

You reach
It can happen to you
It can happen to me
It can happen to everyone eventually

(It's a constant fight)
A constant fight
You're pushing the needle to the red

(Black and white)
Who knows who's right
No substitute you're born you're dead
(Fly by night)
Created out of fantasy
Our destination calls

Look up - Look down
Look out - Look around
Look up - Look down
