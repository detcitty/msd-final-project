Hey you, hey you
Devil's little sister
Listening to your
Twisted transistor

Hold it between your legs
Turn it up, turn it up

The wind is coming through
Can't get enough
A lonely life

Where no one understands you
But don't give up
Because the music do
Music do, music do

Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Because the music do
And then it's reaching
