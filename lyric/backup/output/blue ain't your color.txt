I can see you over there
Starring at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink
All alone tonight

And chances are
You're sittin' here in this bar
‘Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's probably not my place
But I'm gonna say it anyway
‘Cause you look like
You haven't felt the fire
Had a little fun
Hadn't had a smile in a little while
Baby
