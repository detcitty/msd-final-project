Every night i'm lyin' in bed
Holdin' you close in my dreams
Thinkin' about all the things that we said
Comin' apart at the seams
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough
I know you were tryin' to give me the best of your love

Beautiful faces and loud empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wastin' our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
