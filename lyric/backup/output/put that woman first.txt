Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... (Yeah)

If they gleam in the sun
and they shine while they spin and they fit on my truck then {I could remember}
And if it came in a sack
No stems, no seeds in the bag then {I could remember}
And if it dripped from my wrist
And it looked it shined light blue then {I could remember}
But oh, girl
I forgot to be your lover
If it wasn't for the 9 to 5
Double up over time {I could remember}
If it wasn't for the Sunday All-Star
Weekend games, girl {I could remember}
And if it wasn't the dough
Getting fifty G's a show, girl you know that, {I could remember}
But silly, me, silly me, oh
Tell me how could I ever forget to be your lover

Now I realize that you need love too (Oh, yeah)
Spend my life makin' up to you
Oh, girl
Oh, I forgot to be your lover
