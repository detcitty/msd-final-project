It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day
It's a new day

It's been a long time coming
Up the mountain kept runnin'
Songs of freedom kept hummin'
Channeling Harriet Tubman
Kennedy, Lincoln, and King
We gotta manifest that dream
It feels like I'm swimming upstream
It feels like I'm stuck in between
A rock and a hard place
We've been through the heartaches
And lived through the darkest days

If you and I made it this far
Well then hey, we can make it all the way
And they said no we can't
And we said yes we can
Remember it's you and me together
