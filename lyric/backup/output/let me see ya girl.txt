Yeah you got every guy in here
Spinnin' around spillin' their beer.
I bet you came out to have a good time
So what you say you leave your friends with mine?
Ooh, ooh, they'll be alright, ooh, I just wanna see you shine.

Girl you're tearin' that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Woah, baby lets go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
