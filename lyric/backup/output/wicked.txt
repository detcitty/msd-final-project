Now this one dedicated to the man them call MacGuyver
And all 007 James Bond spy man inside the area
Maximum amount of respect to the man them call Ice Cube
And he bust no deuce deuce, no trey 8, but 4 4 wicked!

1. .2. .3 and I come with the wicked style
And you know that I'm from the wicked crew, you act like you knew
But I got everybody jumpin' to the voodoo
You kickin' wicked rhymes, picket signs, while me and my mob got a truck load of 9's
Drop then I'll slay ya, bang, bang, birthday dough for the A-hoe
Ready to Buck! Buck! Buck! But it's a must to Duck! Duck! Duck!
Before I bust!
You lookin' for the one that did it.
You like my vote? No your never gonna get it
Cause I'm the one with the tight mad skills
And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills, Sittin' at the pad just chillin'
Larry Parker just got 2 million, Oh what a fuckin' feelin'
