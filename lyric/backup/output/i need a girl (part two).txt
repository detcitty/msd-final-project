Ooooh oooooo oooooh!!!
Yeah, this that bounce right here
Come On Now!!!
Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now straight to the top now

Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

Girl you made me believe again
If you happy then be with him, go 'head mommy breathe again
Go 'head mommy breathe again, don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head mommy make it hot now
I need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I've been through
And how I had a trifilin mental
So ride with me, G Force fly with me
Times get hard cry with me, die with me
White beach sands lye with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
So tight, now I understand life

What I need
(Yeah take that)
Is a pretty woman next to me
(A pretty woman yeah baby)
To share the dreams that I Believe
(Dream with me, believe in me)
Maybe we could start a family
