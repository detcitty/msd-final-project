Something about the music, she always makes me dance
Something about the music, she always makes me dance
She turns me on and on, and all about

She was a freak, boy was it neat, yeah
Not just knee deep
She was totally deep
When she did the freak with me

She did the freak, never missin' a beat, yeah
She did the freak
