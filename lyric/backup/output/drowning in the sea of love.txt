I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in a sea of love

I've been out here for so very long
I've lost all of my direction
Baby when you came my way
I thought I had found my protection
But a strong wind came into my life
It surely took me by surprise
I can't seem to control these tears
