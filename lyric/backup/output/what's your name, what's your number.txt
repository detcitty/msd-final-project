I went dancin' at the disco last night
I saw this guy, I think I saw the light
I had to find out who he was, who he was
I had to find out, I had to find out

What's your name, what's your number?
What's your name, what's your number?
What's your name, what's your number?
What's your name, what's your number?

I couldn't believe he was lookin' my way
He turned to his friend, this is what I heard him say
"Who is that girl? Who is that girl?
I've got to find out, I've got to find out"

What's your name, what's your number?
What's your name, what's your number?
