How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

(When) I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
(When) I needed someone to understand my ups and downs and there you were
With sweet love and devotion (now)
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I wanna stop and thank you baby, yes I do

How sweet it is to be loved by you, feels so fine
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I wanna stop and thank you baby
I just wanna stop and thank you baby, oh yes
