Welcome to our party, sexy look Ashante's written on you kitten
Lickin' lime from my Bacardi, rubbin' on my ball-d, kissin' twist
And Pauly ask the doc do, do dat do that song
While I, how I do that so long
(Oh ah, oh ah)
On the D L rub baby swell a dub crazy
DJ rewind they know we wit' the 3L dub baby

I move simple just a soothe mental, ooh gentle
I give your mother, mm, mm goose pimples, goose pimples
Ain't the last brother past lover, I be the bachelor of the year
You know that cap watch your back brother

N A U G H T Y B Y n-n-nature not 'cos I hate cha
Master the mattress flip and fall backwards
A kiss on your cheek will make you
Back-flip and chat wit'

Feels good to you
(Good to ya)
Let me see how you rock wit' it
(Rock wit' it)
That's the beat baby drop wit' it
(Drop wit' it)
And don't worry 'bout a damn thing

Feels good to you
(Good to ya)
Let me see how you rock wit' it
(Rock wit' it)
Do your thang come close wit' it
(Close wit' it)
And don't worry 'bout a damn thing
It feels good
(Naughty, naughty)

Hey, ever since back in the day from O P P
Down to Hip-Hop hooray
Who invented party anthems that eat stress away?
You got trauma, never mind that

Naughty By Nature, 3L dub on star tracks
We got the flavor make your hands clap toes crack
And cross in cultural generation H that
Never can you fame that
