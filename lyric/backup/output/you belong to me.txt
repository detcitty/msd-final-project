Why'd you tell me this?
Were you looking for my reaction?
What do you need to know?
Don't you know I'll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got lovin' eyes of my own
(you belong to me)
Tell her tell her you were foolin'
(you belong to me)
You don't even know her
(you belong to me)
Tell her that I love you
(you belong to me)
You belong to me
Can it be honey you're not sure
You belong to me
