Do you remember back in old l.a. (wo-oh-oh)
when everybody drove a chevrolet (wo-oh-oh)
whatever happened to the boy next door,
suntanned, crewcut, all-american male?
Remember dancing at the high school hop
the dress i ruined with the soda pop?
i didn't recognized the girl next door
with beatup sneakers and a pony tail
beach baby, beach baby, give me your hand
