When I'm looking at you I keep thinking
Why can't she be like you, so I'm scheming
I can't go on like this
Believing that her love is true, oh

Standing on the dance floor while she's trickin'
You are all I want girl, she's a chicken
We might be together, but love is missing
Girl I want you, so what can we do, oh

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl but you look good tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
You shouldn't have to be alone tonight
