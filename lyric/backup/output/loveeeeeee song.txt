Ain't nothin' wrong with it...

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection...
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection

Love... love... love... love and affection
Love... love... L-O-V-E-E-E

(And affection) Oh baby...
I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want, baby
Come hold me tight and when I'm drowning save me
Give it to me on a daily if I'm your girl say my name boy
Let me know I'm in control
We both grown so how we feel we can let it show
Won't play around...
I wanna lay you down...
