Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turned the lock & put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do
I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early & you stand & wave
I walk to you

You pulled my chair out & helped me in
And you don't know how nice that is
