I spent all my money
Bought a big door fancy car
For these brides and honeys
Oh yeah you know who you are
Keep me up till the sun is high
Till the birds all call my name
Im addicted and i dont know why
Guess Ive always been this way
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long
All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah you young wild girls
You be the death of me,
The death of me
All you young wild girls
