You're my morning star shining brightly beside me
And if we keep this love
We will last through all eternity
It's just the way we are I love it, love it
It's just the way it should be

'Cos our love will stand tall as the trees
Our love will spread wide as the seas
Our love will shine bright in the night like the stars above
And we'll always be together, our love

My love is surely one thing
You can surely depend on
