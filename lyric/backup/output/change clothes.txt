[Intro: Jay-Z (Pharrell)]
Uh, uh, whooo, the bounce is back
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, uh, your boy is back
(Sexy sexy) I know y'all miss the bounce
Y'Need the bounce for the sexy you know
Let's get it in...

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah ma, your dude is back,
The Maybach roof is back
Tell the whole world the truth is back
You ain't got to argue about who could rap
Cause the proof is back, just go through my raps
New York, New York! yeah where my troopers at?
Where my hustlers? where my boosters at?
I don't care what you do for stacks
I know the world glued you back to the wall
You gotta brawl through that
I been through that,
been shot at shoot back
Gotta keep it peace like a buddhist
I ain't a New Jack nobody 'gon Wesley Snipe me
It's less than likely, move back
