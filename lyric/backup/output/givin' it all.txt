I feel you
I feel you, ooh.
Starlight fall down
For you, for you.

And I never wanted to let you go
To hold someone.
Somebody else, no.
Breaking hearts everywhere you go,
Tell me where you go
Cause our hearts are paid to remain fool.

I keep giving it all just to love someone
I keep giving it all just to love someone
