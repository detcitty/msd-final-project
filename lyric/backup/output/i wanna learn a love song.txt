I come fresh from the street, fast on my feet,
Kinda crass and corny.
Not much meat on my bones and a whole lotta loans
and more than a little bit horny.

The old six string was all i had, to keep my belly still.
And for each full hour lesson i gave,
I got a crisp ten dollar bill.

You see, she was married for seven years,
To a concrete castle king.
She said she wanted to learn to play the guitar
and to hear her children sing.
So i'd show up about once a week in my faded tight legged jeans
