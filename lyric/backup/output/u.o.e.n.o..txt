U.O.E.N.O it
Ol' high class niggas
This shit sound crazy,
Fly shit only
You know what I’m sayin’?

This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it

Ay that monster truck, sit tall as fuck, it’s so big can’t even tow it
Don't like snakes keep my grass cut, so low can't even mow it
