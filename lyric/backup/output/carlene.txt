I was lousy at math, a failed historian
Carlene was the valedictorian
I was quarterback in the back of the class
She was the whiz kid in the horned-rim glasses
It'd been a long time since I'd been around
Since I'd set foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old school yard
And this redhead pulls up in a blue sports car and says
"I'll bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever"
It took a second to put it all together, I said
