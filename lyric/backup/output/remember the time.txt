I Don't Know
That You Want To Try
Evertime You See

Do You Remember
When We Fell In Love
We Were Young

And Innocent Then
Do You Remember
How It All Began
It Just Seemed Like Heaven
So Why Did It End?

Do You Remember
(I Bet You Remember)
Way Back In The Fall
(I Bet You Remember)
We'd Be Together
(I Bet You Remember)

All Day Long
(I Bet You Remember)
Do You Remember
(I Bet You Remember)
Us Holding Hands
(I Bet You Remember)
In Each Other's Eyes
(I Bet You Remember)
We'd Stare
(I Bet You Remember)
(Tell Me)

Do You Remember The Time
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
When We First Met Girl
Do You Remember The Time
(Oh I)
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time

Do You Remember
