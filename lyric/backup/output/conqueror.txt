Life is like a big merry go round
You're up and then down
Going in circles tryna get to where you are
Everybody's been counting you out, but where are they now
Sitting in the same old place just faces in the crowd
We all, make mistakes, you might fall on your face
But you gotta get up

I'd rather stand tall than live on my knees
