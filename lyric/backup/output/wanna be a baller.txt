Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty inch blades on the Impala
A caller gettin' laid tonight
Swisher rolled tight, gotta sprayed by Ike
I hit the highway, making money then fly way
But there's got to be a better way
A better way, better way, yeah
I'ma baller, I'ma twenty inch crawler
Blades on Impala, diamond rottweiller
I, 10 hauler, not a leader not follower
Break these boys off I'ma twenty inch crawler
Bust a left, a right, I'm outta sight, I'm throwed
I'm bouncin' off the road, I'm in a modem with them foe dem
Tiny tune hop out my big body form chain
With the Chong, can't forget Moet along
I'm hot, find me lookin' good, diamonds against my wood
Man it's understood got money in my hood
I'm pushing, big body can't stop me
For the nine, eight got to sell a million copy
I'ma crawl slow puffin' on the Optimo hit the sto'
I'ma go real slow puffin' indo out the do'
I'ma lit the stash green, man, I'm lookin' clean
Want remote control screens with ice bezeltynes
Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty inch blades on the Impala
A caller gettin' laid tonight
Swisher rolled tight, gotta sprayed by Ike
I hit the highway, making money the fly way
But there's got to be a better way
A better way, better way, yeah
Big ballin', smashin', makin' my ends
Smokin' big killa, gettin' high in the Benz
Big ballin', smashin', makin' my ends
Smokin' big killa, gettin' high in the Benz
In the wind smoke goes as I crawl down on Vogues
Twenty Lorenzo, smoke all up in my nose
