Hit the beat now
lost in emotion.
Some guys will promise you a marriage made in heaven

But I'm gonna stick to my guns.
Like waiting for that love that I might be getting

Mv dreams have yet begun.
oh baby
am I a fool 'cause I don't know iust how you feel?
And is my love for you? Oh
I can't conceal.

Oh
I'm lost in emotion

Telling you things you really shouldn't know.
