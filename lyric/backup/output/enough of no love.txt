Eh
Young Mullah Baby...

I admit that you almost had me
I admit I was almost crazy
Had me thinking about calling that b√≠tch at night
And let her know where she can come and meet me
But it's cool, I'mma be a lady
She think she cute but she don't phase me
And if you knew about all of this good love
You'll be missing out on
You wouldn't have played me

Can't say I'm not hurt
I'll be damned if I'm broken
What we had is now hers
Let her know she can have it
