She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh baby)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh baby)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh baby)
She can't help it

The first time that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me, mmm, mmm
Play it cool, but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me, mmm, mmm

You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in love)
So in love with you

She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh baby)
She can't help it
The girl can't help it (oh no)
