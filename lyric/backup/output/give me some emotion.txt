You came into my life
Just like a dream
I think I don'thro famous
for the sea
I often ask if love
is really true
The way i feel about you
Make imagination come alive
Sometimes I wander
how I can survive
For a love so blue
I feel so new and
I'm so glad that I found you
Give me some emotion
from your heart
