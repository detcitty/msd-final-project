Just stop lookin' for love
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got
Just stop lookin' for love
You still got time
Girl, you know you still got time
Girl, you know you still got time

This could be something if you let it be something
Don't scare me away
Turning something's into nothing, babe
You're already used to the games, babe
You play your role and I play the same

Come give it to me, yea ah yea
Come give it to me, play by play
I could tell you've been bored all day
Cuz you're young and you still got time
Don't waste your time
We've been wasting away, aw yeah
And no matter what you say, aw yeah
That smile gon' take you places
And I know you wanna see some faces

Just stop lookin' for love
Girl, you know you still got time
