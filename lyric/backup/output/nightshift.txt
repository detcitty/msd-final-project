Marvin, he was a friend of mine
And he could sing his song
His heart in every line
Marvin, sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds
And I still can hear him say
Oh talk to me, so you can see, what's goin' on
Say you will, sing your songs, for evermore, evermore

Gonna be some sweet sounds
Comin' down, on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
Oh, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night
It's gonna be all right, on the nightshift
You found another home
I know you're not alone, on the nightshift, oooh
