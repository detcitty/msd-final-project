Now, don't just walk away
Pretending everything's ok
And you don't care about me

And I know there's just no use
When all your lies become your truths and I don't care...
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now
Ohhh, ohhh
Would you tell it to my face
Or have I been erased
Are you happy now?
