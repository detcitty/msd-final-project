One, two, three, four

I phoned up my doctor to see what's the matter
He said, "Come on over", I said, "Do I have to?"
My knees started shakin', my wrist started achin'
When my doctor said to me

"Oh my my, oh my my, can you boogie? Can you slide?
Oh my my, oh my my, you can boogie if you try
Oh my my, oh my my, it's guaranteed to keep you alive"
