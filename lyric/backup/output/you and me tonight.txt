I know she's gonna be surprised
Sometimes this key gets stuck in the lock
Oh no, she changed the lock on the door

Yes? who is it?
Star, it's Kirk
I wanna talk, will you let me in?

Kirk, what do you wanna talk to me about?

All I need is about 10 minutes of your time.

Listen, we really don't have anything to talk about.?

Alright, alright, just hear me out, just this once.

I may not be the man
That I wanna be
But I'm sure not the man
That I used to be

You see I changed my way
Turned my life around
Girl I'll never give you up
Give me one more chance

Let's get down to some real good lovin'
Come on girl, 
Let's get down to some real good lovin'
