I knew the man that picked you up
It was gonna be a wild ride
You kissed me like you couldn't have enough
Barely made it out of the U drive
Burn a little rubber at the red light,
Got a little warning from the blue light
It's only going on at nine o'clock
But feels more like midnight

We didn't even turned up the radio,
Maybe two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby, I don't know
