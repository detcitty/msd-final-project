How can I put this in a way
So as not to offend or unnerve
There’s a rumor goin’ all 'round
That you ain’t been gettin’ served

They say that you ain’t you know what
In baby who knows how long
It’s hard for me to say what’s right
When all I wanna do is wrong

Gett off, 23 positions in a 1 night stand
Gett off, I’ll only call you after if you say I can
Gett off, let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off, if you want to baby here I am

I clocked the jizz from a friend
Of yours named Vanessa bet
She said you told her a fantasy
That got her all wet

Something about a little box with a
Mirror and a tongue inside
What she told me then got me so hot
