Get busy!
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live?
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions

That's my prerogative
They say I'm crazy
I really don't care
That's my perogative
They say I'm nasty
But I don't give a damn
Getting girls is how I live
Some ask me questions
Why am I so real?
But they don't undersand me
I really don't know the deal about her brother
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago
