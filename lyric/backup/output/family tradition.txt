Country music singers
Have always been a real close family,
But lately some of my kinfolks
Have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because
I kind of changed my direction
Lord I guess I went and broke their family tradition

They get on me and want to know Hank
Why do you drink?
Hank why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Over and over
