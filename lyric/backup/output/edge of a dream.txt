If tommorow never comes
Would ya still belong to me
Guess i've always known it was meant to be
We took a second chance on love and it carried us away
Now it's gettin' stronger day by day

The closer it gets the further it seems
It's always one step out of reach

On the edge of a dream
You know you are
On the edge of a dream
