When we started open-hearted
It was me lovin' you, you lovin' me
Then we parted broken-hearted
And now all the fun is through

You can't hide it, keep it quiet me needin' you
You haven't heard
Don't deny it, we can try it
I need your lovin' too

You had your hands in hers
You were smilin'
Oh baby don't you know it
I can smile all the while I'll be cryin' too

Just one more time
I gotta feel your arms around me
