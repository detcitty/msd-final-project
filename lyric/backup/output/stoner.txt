Imma stoner, Imma stoner, Imma stoner
Imma stoner, Imma stoner, Imma stoner
Imma stoner, Imma stoner, Imma stoner
I just put a forty on my wrist just like a boss
I just put ten thousand on my bitch just like bust
I just came from YSL just like I'm from Boston
Just like I'm from Boston, just like I'm from Boston:
Thugger Thugger, you
I want Michael Jackson land, ohh
Aww Imma cash out on it
I'm high as hell ain't got no satellites on me
I tell that bitch I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
