Sometimes I imagine the world without you
But most times I'm just so happy that I ever found you

It's a complicated web
That you weave inside my head
So much pleasure with such pain
How we always, always stay the same

I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs, I'm digging the lows
'Cause atleast I feel alive

I've never faced so many emotional days
But my life is good I'm feeling you
