Step right up, and don't be shy
Because you will not believe your eyes
She's right here, behind the glass
You're gonna like her 'cause she's got class

You can look inside another world
You get to talk to a pretty girl
She's everything you dream about

But don't fall in love
She's a beauty
(She's one in a million girls)
She's a beauty
(Why would I lie)
