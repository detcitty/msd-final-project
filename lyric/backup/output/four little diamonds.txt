Is this on?
OK, after four!
Four!

I used to think she was the greatest thing
I really can't give her a diamond ring
She said she'd rather die than ever leave me

Well I never saw her face since then
And if the law don't get her then I will
Four little diamonds

She must be somewhere on the open road
She always said she was the lonely one
She gets you down with her tales of woe

She took me for everything
