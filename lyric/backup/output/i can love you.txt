I can love you
(I can love you)
I can love you
(I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

I can love you
(I can love you)
I can love you
(I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

Sitting here
Wondering why you don't love me
The way that I love you
And baby have no fear
'Cause I would never ever hurt you
And you know my love is real, boy I can

I can love you
(I can love you)
I can love you
(I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

I can love you
(I can love you)
I can love you
(I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

I know some times
Can get rough but we'll make it
We'll make it through the storm
And I know I will try
To make sure that you can trust me
And you know the reason why that I say
