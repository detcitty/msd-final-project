I'm trying not to pretend that it wont happen again, and again like that
...
Never thought it would end, cuz you got up in my head, in my head like that
You made me happy baby, love is crazy, so amazing
...
But it's changing, rearranging
I don't think I can take anymore
Cuz the walls burned up and our love fell down

And it turned into whatever, now we're saying never
Feel the fire cuz it's all around and it's burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go, be on our way
Live for another day, cuz it ain't the same, my baby
Watch it all fallin to the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster
...
I didn't want it this way, I only wanted to say
I loved you right
