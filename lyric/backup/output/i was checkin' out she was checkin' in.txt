Spoken:
I just got finished given the hotel
manager back the room key and paid my bill

I was outside in the car
In the shadows of the parkin' lot
Tellin' the woman I was with
how happy she made me
Kissin' and huggin'

An all of a sudden another car
pulled up on the parkin' lot
But I couldn't believe my eyes
'Cause the woman that was sitting
in the front seat beside another dude
Turned out to be my old lady

Sings:
Lord, I was checkin' out
And she was checkin' in
Yeah, yeah, yeah, (yeah)
(Oh yeah)
Oh, let me tell you people
I was checkin' out, um-hm
An my old lady was checkin' in
Oh Lord, have mercy!
