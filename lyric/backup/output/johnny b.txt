It's a sleepless night, she's callin' your name
It's a lonely ride, I know how you want her
Again and again, you're chasin' a dream, yeah
But Johnny my friend, 'cause she's not what she seems

Johnny B, how much there is to see
Just open your eyes and listen to me
Straight ahead, a green light turns to red
