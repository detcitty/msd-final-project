Ooh, you had me crying
Tears upon your pillow
Hanging your head on the wall

Show 'em you can take it
Serve it like
You never could fall

Stillsane
You may think you're crossing the line
Stillsane
You may think you're losing your mind

As you stare at their faces
Stare at their faces
Stare at their faces
