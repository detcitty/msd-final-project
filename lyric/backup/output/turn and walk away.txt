You still believe you love him
I still believe I'm right
You're lost and I can't find you
You're somewhere in the night

We've got nothing left to talk about
This time it's goodbye
But you can't hurt me anymore
I've no more chance to cry

Walk away
Gonna build our plans to start again
Walk away
We're gonna turn our backs on love
