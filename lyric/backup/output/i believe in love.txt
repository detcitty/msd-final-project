I see faces!
Coverin' an empty 'I'
Empty spaces
Where there used to be a soul inside

Nothin' and no one ever gets to them
Seems the wind could blow right through them
Believin' in gods that never knew them
I believe in love

I believe in love, I do!
I believe I'm feelin' good
I'm feeling love!
(feeling love is feeling good)
I believe in love
Feeling love is feeling good!

Worry!
