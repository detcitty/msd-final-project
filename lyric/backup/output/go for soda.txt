Might as well go for a soda
Nobody hurts and nobody cries
Might as well go for a soda
Nobody drowns and nobody dies

So we're in one of our blue moods
You wanna have it your way and I want it mine
All this debating going 'round in our blue mood
Makes me thirsty for love

(Might as well)
Might as well go for a soda
Nobody hurts and nobody cries
