Chorus: Nate Dogg

I've got hoes (I've got hoes)
In different area codes (area) area codes (codes)
Hoes (hoes.hoes) in different area codes (area) area codes (codes)

Now you thought I was just somethin' somethin' no
In 4-0-4, I'm worldwide GET, act like y'all don't know
It's the abominabol-hoe man
Globe-trot international post man
Neighbor-dick dope man
7-1-8s, 2-0-2's
I send small cities and states I-O-U's
9-0-1, matter fact 3-0-5
I'll jump off the G4, we can meet outside
