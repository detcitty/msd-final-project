You still got that light in your eye
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travellin' this long road to be with you
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go.

The first time I set eyes on you, and I listened to you sing, yeah yeah
We didn't have to speak cause the words said everything
Yes you walked right into my life, and we were on our way, yeah
So long ago, but it feels like yesterday.

And I just wanna tell you...

You still got that light in your eye (yes you do)
And our day is comin' by and by
I'm travellin' this long road to be with you
We still gotta long way, we still gotta long way to go.
