I went to a party last Saturday night
I didn't get laid, I got in a fight
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
Late for my job and the traffic was bad
Had to borrow ten bucks from my old man
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
I went to a party last Saturday night
I told you that story, I'd be alright
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing

But I know what I like
I know I like dancin' with you
