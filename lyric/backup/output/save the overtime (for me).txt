Darling, don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me

Darling, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby
Save the overtime for me

I walk around
Tryin' to find something to do
Baby, until your return
Turn on T.V.
Or play some solitaire
It does the job for a while
(For a while)

But nothing takes the place of you
(Nothing takes the place of you)
Just ain't no substitute
(Ain't no substitute)
'Cause you're all that I want in me
Only you can set me free

Darling, don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me

Darling, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby
