If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top, for sure I'mma make it hot, baby

I apply pressure to pussies that stunting I pop
Stand alone squeezing my pistol, I'm sure that I gotta
Now Peter Piper picked peppers and Run rocked rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a little bit, but I pop nines
Tell niggas "Get they money right" cause I got mine
And I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine
You gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump, is that what you want?
Be easy, nigga, I'll lay your ass out
Believe me, nigga, that's what I'm about, gangsta
You could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
