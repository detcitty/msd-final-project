Yeah
No, nigga, you don't really wanna take this cool off
Boi, thug

She got me early in the mornin' when she's all alone
I'ma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood
Girl, I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Yeah, yeah

She love the way I'm doin' it, do it
So good, she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is you the finest
Gave you a new name

What's that, what's that, what's that?
My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there

Let's capture this moment
If I hit it then I own it
Marijuana every mornin'
And Patronin', girl, we groanin'
