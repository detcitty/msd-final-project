You gotta act like a woman
And think like a a man

Why you call me your dream bed
And foolish of me I believe that
You said every king needs his queen babe
That's why you needed me baby
Right in between lost and love
You go and mess things up
Now there's no we babe
There's just you and there's me baby

There was us, there was trust
There was happen and change, I know
Silly you, silly me, silly us, what I've wait

But in love, love, love
You gotta act like a woman and think like a man
But in love, love, love
