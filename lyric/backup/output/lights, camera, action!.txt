I'm talkin' to these motherfuckers
Yea, OK
Yea, ooh, ooh (This one's a vivrant thing)
LB, G.I. one fam, oh my (Bounce with me now)
Big, dawg, hot (I'm talkin', this gone be somethin now)
Mr. Cheeks, whoo (I'm talkin' lights, camera, action)
Oh Kay (Get down now)
Big dawg now one shot deal shit

Yea, OK
Now I'm in the spot where I want to be
Money spent, niggas gettin bent, chicks in front of me
Just the way I like it, hunnies turnin' somethin'
I got a seat up in the cut and I'm burnin' somethin'
Booties dancin' 'round a nigga and I'm killin' one
Killin' one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns
Plus I'm do' low at a table, I'm fuckin with this chick,
with a phat body and the ring up in her navel
Dances around, she struts with the "fuck" walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk
Do whatcha gotta do, I ain't mad at 'chu
Know a lot of haters when they seen and as bad as you
You's a real bad girl, a nigga need that
Sippin' on ya Henny, askin' where the weed at
Lemme put you onto somethin'
You fuckin' with a big nigga, no frontin'

[Chorus: x2]
Uh shorty, turn it around lemme see somethin'
