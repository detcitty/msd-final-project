Why can't we be humble
Like the good Lord said
He promised to exalt us
For love is the way

How men be so greedy
When there's so much left
All things are God given
And they all have been blessed

That's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be, didn't He
Well, that's the way God planned it
That's the way God wants it to be, for you and me
