It's the perfect time of year
Somewhere far away from here
I feel fine enough, I guess
Considering everything's a mess

There's a restaurant down the street
Where hungry people like to eat
I could walk but I'll just drive
It's colder than it looks outside

It's like a dream, you try to remember but it's gone
Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When you try to see the world beyond your front door

Take your time 'coz the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile
When you realize that a guy my size might take a while
Just to try to figure out what all this is for
