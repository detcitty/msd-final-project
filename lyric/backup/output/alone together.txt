II don't know where you're going,
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going,
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end

Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs

Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We can stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young

Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
