My heart starts breaking
when i think of making up
plans to let you go
i keep thinking maybe tomorrow
i'm gonna let you know
but when i think about leaving
i think about losing
the only love i ever knew
every time i think of you
My heart starts aching
my hands keep shaking
and you know, you know, you know
