Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for makin' up a monster to share
Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for breakin' our own fairy tale

Ain't, ain't, ain't nobody's got to spell it for me
Ain't nobody got it yet I can see
Ain't nobody got the thing I can hear
But if I have to I will yell in your ear
