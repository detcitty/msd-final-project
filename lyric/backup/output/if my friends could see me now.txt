f they could see me now
That old gang of mine
I'm eating fancy chow
And drinking fancy wine
I'd like those stumble bums
To see for a fact
The kind of top drawer
First rate chums I attract
All I can say is, wow
Hey, look at where I am
I've landed, pow
Right in a pot of jam
What a setup, holy cow
They'd never believe it
If my friends could see me
