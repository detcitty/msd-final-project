If you only knew
I'm hanging by a thread
The web I spin for you
If you only knew
I'd sacrifice my beating
Heart before I lose you
I still hold onto the letters
You returned
I swear I've lived and learned

It's 4: 03 and I can't sleep
Without you next to me I
Toss and turn like the sea
If I drown tonight, bring me
