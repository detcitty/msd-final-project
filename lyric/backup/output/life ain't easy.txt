(Ray Sawyer/Shel Silverstein)

Well here I am in the wind again, floating where it takes me
Laughin' and a splashin' in the summer sun, until the alarm clock awakes me
Then it's coffee and a kiss and two cigarettes, and I'm back out in the cold, cold weather
Chasin' my dream but I just can't seem to rub two coins together
(Sing it)
