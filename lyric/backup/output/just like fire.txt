I know that I'm running out of time
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it all, mmm, mmm
And I'm walking on a wire, trying to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm, mmm

We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flying free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me any way
Just like fire, uh
