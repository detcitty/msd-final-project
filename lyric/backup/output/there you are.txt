Like a candle with a flame
That never dies
Through the good and bad
You've been by my side, my side

And when the world outside
Is feeling so unkind
You were there to pick me up
Oh, how I need your smile

Whenever I fall
There you are
I know that my pain
You feel in your heart

And when the life that I live
Seems so hard
There you are
