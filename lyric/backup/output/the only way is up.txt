We've been broken down
To the lowest turn
Bein' on the bottom line
Sure aint no fun

But if we should be evicted
Huh, from our homes,
We'll just move somewhere else
And still carry on

Oh

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) hold on
Ooooh, aah, baby

(hold on) hold on
(hold on) ooh oooh aah

(Chorus)
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
