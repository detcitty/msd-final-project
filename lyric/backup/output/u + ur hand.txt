Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh

Check it out, going out on the late night
Looking tight, feeling nice, it's a cock fight
I can tell I just know that it's going down tonight
At the door we don't wait cause we know them
At the bar, six shots, just beginning
That's when dickhead put his hands on me

But you see
I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
Cause you know it's over before it began

Keep your drink, just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight
