Don't let it go to your head, no
Don't let it go to your head, no, no, no, no

Now a lot of people think this is easy as it looks
Books and books of rhyme concepts and hooks
Session to session to get thoughts manifested
Stressin' and stressin' to hit the world with a blessin'

Lot of people often ask, "Puba how you givin' back?"
The way I give back is through the knowledge of my raps
Like a gem, for all my people caught out on a limb
Who be givin' in, caught out on a stem, who don't wanna win

I'm feelin' you, I know you gettin' down like that
But what I'm sayin' dog is let me hold a little somethin' black
I'll hit you back, c'mon dead that, that's the tenth time
I heard that all you know is gimme

I work hard for every penny that I make video and tape
LP and CD, if I fall, you feedin' me?
No dough to spread, always keep a level head
Long as my seeds get fed, it won't go to my head, so

Don't let it go to your head, no
Everybody love a star, when he on top
Don't, don't let it to go your head, no
Nobody comes around when the star start to drop
