Degradation, aggravation
Jealousy's my observation
Hard envy, youreally send me
Don't stand close
or you'll offend me

You see the people at the door
You know the game
You know the score
Here's a girl, the bitter pill

You know, i work hard
For the things that i've got
You just need to get up off
Your behind and get yourself together

Naw, uh, uh, don't be ragging on me
For trying to do my thing

All the time its a human emotion
Share your feelings with the needy
Can't you see, its a drop in the ocean
