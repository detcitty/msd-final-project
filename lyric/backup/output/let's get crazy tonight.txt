Life can be too much you see
We all need insanity
You're off the hook when you're off the wall
You got to say, the hell with them all

C'mon let's get crazy tonight
No time to worry if we're wrong or we're right
Caught up with people we've never met
Ooh, Sunday morning we'll forgive and forget

Before the dawn begins to shine it's hazy blue light
