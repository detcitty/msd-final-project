I was ridin' shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart

I look around
Turn the radio down
He says
"Baby, is somethin' wrong?
I say
"Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says

Our song is the slammin' screen door

Sneakin' out late
Tappin' on your window

When we're on the phone
And you talk real slow

'Cause it's late
And your mama don't know
