featuring R.L. from Next

(R.L)

To just act like we never were
to come around and not show hurt
how dare we greet by shaking hands
just months ago I was your man (was your man)

(Deborah)

Verbally we'd agreed it was over
and we were though

(R.L.)
I'm to compose myself but i just
can't get over you girl (oh oh oh)

()

(R.L.)
We can't be friends
(yeah oh no)
we can't be friends
(Deborah, you know I can't go on being just your friend, yeah)
cuz I'm still in love with you
