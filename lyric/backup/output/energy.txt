[Baby Bash]
Energy, digging on your energy
Energy, digging on your energy
Energy, digging on your energy. energy

[Chorus 2x]
Boy, I'm digging on your energy (Energy)
And I'm digging what you telling me (Telling me)
So I wrote this little melody (Melody)
And dedicate it to my favorite lover

[Verse 1 - Natalie]
I'm lying in bed
There's thoughts in my head
I'm thinking bout you
Over and over and over and over again
What can I tell you, you got me so twisted
Tossing and turning
Over and over and over and over again
So I wrote a song tonight (Tonight)
