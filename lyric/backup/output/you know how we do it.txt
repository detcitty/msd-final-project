Yeah... yeah!
Fool -- you know how we do it

West Side
Comin from the West Side
Nothin but the West Side

Ain't nuttin goin on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin six on artillery, you don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin, ain't no stoppin
Fo'-hoppin, ass droppin, Coupe DeVille
