They got a lotta girls who know they got it goin' on
But nothing's ever a comparison to you
Now can't you see that you're the only one I really want
And everything I need is everything you do

Any girl walk by don't matter
Cause you're looking so much better
Don't ever need to get caught up in jealousy
She could be a super model
Every magazine the cover
She'll never mean a thing to me

She's no you... oh, no
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you... oh, no
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
'Cause you're all the girl that I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you
She's no you

They gotta a lotta girls who dance in all the videos
