(feat. Left Eye)

[Keith:]
How do you like it when I do it just like this
How do you like it when I do it just like that
How do you like it when I do it just like this
How do you like it when I do it just like that

[1] - And all the gangsta's say

[Repeat 1 (3x)]

[Keith (Left Eye):]
I don't want to do you wrong baby (do you wrong)
I just want to treat you right (treat you right) baby
Come and lay with me my girl (lay with me)
I just want to serve you right

How do you like it baby (nice and slow boy)
Tell me how you want it baby (here we go my baby)
Tell me girl what makes you feel good my baby
(nice and slow boy)
Tell me girl how do you like it baby (here we go my baby)
