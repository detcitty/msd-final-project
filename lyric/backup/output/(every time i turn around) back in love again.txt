Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love

I get mixed emotions
It's the way my feelings flow
Excuse me, I'm only human
Sometimes I, I just don't know

Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again

Doo doo doo doo doo
Back in love again
Doo doo doo doo doo
Back in love

When you put your arms around me
I feel so satisfied
I want to love you forever
