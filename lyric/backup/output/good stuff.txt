Brrrr!
All right
Bum bum-Bum bum (in combinations)
Ooo baby!
What?
How about givin' me some of that good stuff
Well...

Here it 'tis
Here it 'tis
Here it 'tis
Here it 'tis

Are you lookin' for it?
Are you lookin' for it?
You'll hear it from me
Good stuff baby

Do you want it?
Do you know how to get it?
That good stuff baby
Good good stuff

I got sincerity that's bonifide
And a heart so fine it's certified
So let your good stuff rain down on me
Your dang good stuff that's true and tried

Are you lookin' for it?
Are you lookin' for it?
You'll hear it from me
Good stuff baby
