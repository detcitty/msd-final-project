We live in the modern age
Where love is fast like a turning page
In a magazine, we've hardly seen
The friends we used to know
They disappear, they come and go
Like the times we've had
It's kind of sad

Whatever happened to old fashioned love
The kind that would see you through
The kind of love my Momma and Daddy knew
