I'm coming over
Coming, coming, listen girl

I'm whispering words over your shoulder
Ooh can't you hear?
Before you reply the temperature rise
Then like that you disappear

I never imagined, I'd get so excited
Over a rendezvous
I'll be there in an hour still wet from the shower
I just called to tell you

It's on tonight, the feeling's right
