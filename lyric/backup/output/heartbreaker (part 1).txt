Heartbreaker, Heartbreaker, heartbreaker, baby
Somebody, somewhere told me this about you, (baby, heartbreaker)
They say you're a heartbreaker but it just can't be true, (baby, heartbreaker)
I don't care what those other people say,
I'm gonna love you anyway, (baby, baby, baby)
(Heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heartbreaker, heartbreaker)

Just forget those fellas who are now in your past, (baby, ooh baby)
Hope they find a way to make a good thing last, (baby, oh baby)
