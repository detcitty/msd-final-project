Yes indeed - it's the mix king - Ron G
I got somethin - the world - ain't ready for
New York City - L.A. - Chicago - Atlanta
D.C. - Detroit - New Orleans, y'all know the deal
FLAVA!!!!

Hahahahahaha! Yeah nigga!
Yeah. that's right. BAYY-BAYY!
That's how we do it

Follow me tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin' to kill me
Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points 'til they drill me
Keepin' it real and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin' steel
See niggas is false, sittin in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
