Put your flags up in the sky
(put them in the sky)
And wave them side to side
(side to side)
Show the world where you're from
(show 'em where you from)
Show the world we are one
(one love, life)

Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola
Ole ole ole ola

When the moment gets tough
You've got keep going
One love, one life, one world
One fight, whole world, one night, one place
Brazil
Everybody put your flags in the sky and do what you feel

Cuz it's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play
It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play

Es mi mundo, tu mundo, el mundo, de nosotros
