I'm lookin' over the skyline of the city
How loud quiet nights in the mist of crime
How next door to happiness lives sorrow
And signals of solution in the sky

A city of justice, a city of love, a city of peace
For everyone of us
We all need it, can't live without it
A Gotham City, oh yeah

How sleepin' awake because of fear
(Oh yeah)
How children are drowning in their tears
How we need a place where we can go
A land where every one will have a hero
