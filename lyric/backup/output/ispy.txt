Man, fuck
What's wrong Kyle?
Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see? You see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, woah...
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right...
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil' Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for


I ain't been gettin' high...
Well maybe a little, baby I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
