Outside another yellow moon
Punched a hole in the nighttime, yeah
I climb through the window and down to the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
With all those Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds

You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Ooh, be careful of 'em in the dark
Oh if I was the one
You chose to be your only one
can't you hear me now
can't you hear me now
