Hit'em with this
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Dope, def, any term is alright
When your DJ plays the K
You will lesten to what the Kid has to say
Cause you know it's too damn straight
Can't wait
Gotta get on down before it's too late
And even if so, it would be my friend
Just tell'em to play it again
See, once it starts
To beat your eardrums
It goes way up to your head
Bounces down to your belly and back
If you hunger, you'll be fed
It's all up to the individual
This reaction is typical
Somehow you get to catch up with that beat
Snap them fingers, stomp your feet
Do I love it? Oh, yeah, do I want it? Hell, yeah
