Hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you
(If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you)
Crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you
(Metro Boomin want some more nigga)

Ya alright, alright, alright
You was right I was wrong
Ya I should've never ever took her home
Ya I should've just boned
Ya fantasy on my phone
Ya hit it from the back watch a nigga bless you
Ya crying in my arms like a nigga wrecked you
Talking about a broken heart running to the restroom

Looked at my momma just like we rich
