Lucy gets home late at night
She gropes in the dark and flicks on the light
Turnin' the switch on her radio set
And spinning the dial like playing Russian Roulette

Hoping to catch her favorite DJ
Maybe he'll play her "That'll Be the Day"
Taking her back to her high school days
When love was real, not a dream for a day
Not a dream far away

But love, love is on the airwaves tonight
Love is on the airwaves tonight
And no one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna break your heart

Gary's only 5 feet 4
When he hears his favorite record, he feels 10 feet tall
Dancing around with his headphones on
