Winters getting colder, Summer gettin warmer
Tidal wave comin cross the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon it's cheaper by the barrel
Just don't get busted singing Christmas carols

[Chorus]
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the o-zone burnin
Funny how the world keeps turnin
Look Ma, no hands
I love this American Ride
