(Lari White/Craig Wiseman/David Kent)

Here I am at another dead end
Stopped in my tracks again
Closer then I've been to where I want to be
A broken heart standing in my way
Big as life on a real bad day
Making lemons into lemonade
Ain't nothing new to me No

This ain't no stumbling block
It's just a stepping stone
I'm gonna climb right up on top
And take a good look at where I'm going
And it ain't gonna slow me down
Hold me back or turn me around (Stepping Stone)
