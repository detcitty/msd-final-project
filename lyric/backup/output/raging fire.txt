We are dead to rights, born and raised
We are thick and thin to our last days
So hold me close and I'll surrender to your heart
You know how to give and how to take
You see every hope I locked away
So pull me close and surrender to my heart
Before the flame goes out tonight
Yeah we live until we die

So come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul
Into a raging fire
Come out, come out, come out
Till we lose control
Into a raging fire
