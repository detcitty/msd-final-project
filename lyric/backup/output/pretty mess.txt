Ahh!... Here we go again falling on my bed and pulling on a pillow
Well I think you got what it takes to get me boiling like a kettle
Here everything's boiling up
I boil to the maximum, yeah
Well I do believe babe, you boil me bubbling
You get me in so much trouble

Ooh and baby someday soon
I will take you there
Promise you the moon
And then he pulled a seam and it went all the way

(chorus)
