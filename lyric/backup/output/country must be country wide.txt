Go ahead and crank this on up
Mmmhmmm
I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Workin' spittin' huntin' and fishin'
Stone cold country by the grace of God

I was gasin' up the other day
An ol' boy pulled up with a license plate from Ohio I thought oh good Lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile

Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playin' Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
