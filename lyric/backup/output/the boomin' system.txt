Just kick a little somethin' for them cars that be bumpin', yeah aight
But we need a beat that they can front to oh, that'll work
Be funky you know what I'm sayin'?

Cars ride by with the boomin' systems
Cars ride by

Funky for all the cars out there
And all the brothers
That like to front in their rides
Check it out

You know it's funky, funky, funky 'cos you heard it from hear-say
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around
12 o'clock at night with your windows down

Headlights breakin' 'cos your batteries drain
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin' outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots

Leanin' to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack

'Cos they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day
