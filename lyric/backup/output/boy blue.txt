Where are you?

You never knew yourself well enough, hah
But she never knew you at all
And when she put you out on your own
It may have stolen your innocence but not, no not your soul

Tell me where is little boy blue, ho ho?
You'll find him standin' always one step ahead, oh
First a little shy, a little boy blue woh
Wise blood runs warm and deep
