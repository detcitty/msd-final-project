Really?
Yeah (Six!)
Yeah
Murda on tha beat, so it's not nice


That's Baka, he's a no-long-talker
Quick to let a motherfuckin' TEC slam
We don't need to hear about a next man
Youts talk down, then they get ran
Left them, get dipped from the whole ends
If Gilla call shots, no questions
G-Way 'til I'm restin'
But we still got love for the West End
If it's a chit-chat ting, better talk nice
Murda on the beat, so it's not nice
