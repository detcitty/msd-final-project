(Timothy B. Schmit/Will Jennings/Bruce Gaitsch)

They're in the heat in the heart of the city
Big wind out of Mexico
There's a girl, wants it bad as me
And I'll be right there when she lets go.

So let it all come down
Don't care where were going
There's trouble in this town
It's just what I need

I'm tired of looking back
No one lives forever
I'm jumping off the track
