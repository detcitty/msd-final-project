I'm in the business of misery
Let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out

When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months
She finally set him free
I told him I can't lie he was the only one for me

Two weeks and we had caught on fire
She's got it out for me
But I wear the biggest smile
Whoa, I never meant to brag

But, I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
