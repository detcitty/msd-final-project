That's my girl

Who's been working so damn hard
You got that head on overload?
Got yourself this flawless body
Aching now from head to toe
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
All my ladies 'round the world
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Good girls better get bad

You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go
Destiny said it, you got to get up and get it
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder
Then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high
That's my girl

That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
(Get up, what you waiting for?)
