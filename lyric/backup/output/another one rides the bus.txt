Ridin' in the bus down the boulevard
And the place was pretty packed, yeah
Couldn't find a seat so I had to stand
With the perverts in the back
It was smellin' like a locker room
There was junk all over the floor
We're already packed in like sardines
But we're stoppin' to pick up more, look out
Another one rides the bus, another one rides the bus
