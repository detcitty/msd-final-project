Girl
there's something bout me that you outta know.
I never felt the need to lose control.
Always held on back and played it slow.
But not this time.
Baby don't be gentle
I can handle anything.

Baby
take me on a journey.
I've been thinking lately
I could use a little time alone with you.
Crazy
let's do something, maybe.
Please don't take your time
you got me
right where you want me.
