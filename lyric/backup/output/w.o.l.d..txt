Hello honey, it's me
what did you think when you heard me back on the radio?
what did the kids say when they knew it was their long lost daddy-o?
remember how we listened to the radio
and i said `that's the place for me'
and how i got the job as an fm jock the day you married me?
we were two kids and i was was into am rock
but i just had to run around
it's been eight years since i left you babe
let me tell you 'bout what's gone down
chorus
