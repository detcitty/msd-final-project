There she goes and knows I'm dying when she says "Who is Johnny?"
Games with names that girl is playing, all she says is "Who is Johnny?"
I tried to understand because I'm people too
And playing games is part of human nature
My heart's in overdrive, it's great to be alive

"Who's Johnny?" she said and smiled in her special way
"Johnny," she said, "you know I love you"
"Who's Johnny" she said and tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away
Alright, oh yeah

She makes sure I see her teasing, hear her say "Who is Johnny?"
There's no way today is easy, hear her say "Who is Johnny?"
I really couldn't help but fall in love with her
Her being there has made my life worth living
I knew it from the start, that I would lose my heart

"Who's Johnny?" She said and smiled in her special way
"Johnny," she said, "you know I love you"
"Who's Johnny" she said and tried to look the other way
still pretending
