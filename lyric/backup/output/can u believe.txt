Nothing can make you high
Or put fire in your eyes
Or give you a chance to fly
When you need the wings

When all that you've got is doubt
And nothing can stop you from feeling down
But oh I know, I know exactly how you feel

But can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now
Can you believe

When all that you've got is doubt
