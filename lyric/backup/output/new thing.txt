Information came about her
Suddenly I live without her
Turn my stereo up louder
I don't wanna hear about her

Took myself a small vacation
Kind of an investigation
Checking out a new sensation
Finding much invigoration

Hand is on the buzzer
And I'm walking through the door

Get high on a new thing
Get high on a new thing
