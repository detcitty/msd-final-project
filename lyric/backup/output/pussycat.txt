This is another Missy Elliott exclusive

It's all for the love
But there is more things that keep a man satisfied
And I know the remedy just to cure him from
Cheating even if he tried, hey

Pussy, don't fail me now
I gotta turn this nigga out
So he don't want nobody else
But me and only me

Pussy, don't fail me now
I gotta turn this nigga out
So he don't want nobody else
But me and only me

I know he's a man and men have intentions
To sleep with someone else
But that's why when I make love to him
I'm ruling, try to give him my best, hey

Pussy, don't fail me now
