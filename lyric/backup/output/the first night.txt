Baby, baby, tell me what's up
Can you hear me, or do I, do I need to turn it up, huh? Huh?

Boy, this evening, was it only me
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, 'fraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feeling this way
Especially the thought of giving in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
