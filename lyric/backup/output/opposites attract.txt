I'm M.C. Kat on the rap so mic it
Here's a little story and you're sure to like it
Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool
With my home girl, Paula Abdul

Baby seems we never ever agree
You like the movies and I like TV
I take things serious and you take 'em light
I go to bed early and I party all night

Our friends are sayin' we ain't gonna last
'Cuz I move slowly and baby I'm fast
I like it quiet and I love to shout
But when we get together, it just all works out

I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact
We come together 'cuz opposites attract
