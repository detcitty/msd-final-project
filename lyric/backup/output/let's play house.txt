That's right...
Some of that shit you just can't fuck wit
Tha Dogg Pound flava
For the nine-fever
Know what I'm sayin'?
Michel'le in the house
That's right, set it off

Young Daz struck a match and the match went out
But it wasn't no more lights in the house, check it out
Speakin' of house let's play a game of it
Are ya wit it?
Hide and go get it, I betcha love it baby
I'll play the daddy and you can play the momma
So we can get down upon the living room floor
Are ya wit it?
I promise I won't kill it
Puddy-cat on a leash what should I do, should I kill it? Yesss

See back in the day when we used to play
You wanted to be with me (That's right!)
Now that is so right and natural
No other man that I can see
I'm singin' in my background
Diggin' up a hole for you to make your move
But no longer will I be told regroup

Let's play house...
