Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her

She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said

Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you're a song
