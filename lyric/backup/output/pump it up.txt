(Just Blaze)
We gon' do it like
(Uuh, uuh, uhh)
Look, pump it up if you came to get it krunk

With a dame and shit that's drunk
You came to get it on
More than 5 O's in ya bank then get it on
Roll up like that stank and get it on
Slank that fitted on, came to get it on
Hold up she want work that, twork that
Then again lemme hurt that, murk that
Til ya gotta hurt back
Can't spit it out
Boo you gotta slurp that
Can't cuddle after we done, it wasn't worth that
Joey I'm responsible for bringin' Jersey back
(And we bad huh)
She at the bar stylin' she throwin' it up
She drink a little hypno, throwin' it up
But I'm only dealing with freaks that wanna cut
