I still love you, babe
I'm still for you, girl
I'll never leave you, baby
'Cause I realize I need you in my life

Girl it just ain't right what we said last night
'Cause I know we didn't mean it
You feel the love is gone 'cause we don't get along
But I can prove you wrong girl I swear

'Cause every time I close my eyes I see you
(I see you)
And how I wanna live my life is with you
There is no one, you're all I need and all I want
The only one I'll ever love

I still love you babe
('Cause without you there's no me)
I'm still for you girl
(Even though we disagree)
I'll never leave you baby
(I'll never leave you baby)
