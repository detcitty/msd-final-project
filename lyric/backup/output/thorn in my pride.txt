Wake me when the day break
Show me how the sun shine
Tell me about your heartache
Who could be so unkind

Do you dream to touch me
And smile down deep inside
Or could you just kill me, hey
It's hard to make up your mind, sometimes

My angels, my devils, a thorn in my pride
My angels, my devils, a thorn in my pride
