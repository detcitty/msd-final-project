In the moon of the fallen leaves (Wovoka)
Appeared one day
He had come of the land of spirit
With the message of prophecy

The flood will come and save you
Next spring when the good times come
From the lake of the pyramids (Wovoka)
Was here to say

Our people must dance
Keep on dancing, keep on dancing
Our people must sing
