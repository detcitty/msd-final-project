Where were you when the lights went out
In New York City
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
Where were you when the lights went out
In New York City

Don't you know that I was making love
(She was making love)

I remember on the 13th of July
The only light was the light up in the sky
New York had black-out for 25 hours or more
And nobody really knows the reason why

Ooh, somebody called it love down on the socket (The socket)
It was safe to say I went the door to lock it (To lock it)
So I took my lady by the hand
And led her to love me, love me, love me!

Where were you when the lights went out
