LL and, Lil' Mo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohh, oh

When I cry, baby, you cry
When we cry, baby, it's like
You know, ohh, oh, how love goes
Say it again

When I cry, baby, you cry
When we cry, baby, it's like
(Yeah)
You know
(Ohh, oh)
How love goes
(Now give it to 'em)

How ever it go I'm going out for you, girl
If I'm a stick up kid I'm pulling out for you, girl
If I was hustling I'd pump coke for you, girl
If I was a dread then I'd smoke for you, girl

I play captain, rock the boat for you, girl
I play martin and bring hope to you, girl
When I was away look how I wrote to you, girl
Wasn't I polite when I spoke to you, girl

Tricked on you cop that coke for you, girl
I'd do anything but go broke for you, girl
Since I'm a rapper I wrote a song for you, girl
Since I'm a gun clapper I keep it warm for you, girl

Lift some weights and keep it hard for you, girl
Sunday morning pray to God for you, girl
If that don't work catch a charge for you, girl
Or flip some bars become a star for you, girl

When I cry, baby, you cry
(You cry)
When we cry, baby, it's like
You know ohh, oh, how love goes
Come on, say it again
