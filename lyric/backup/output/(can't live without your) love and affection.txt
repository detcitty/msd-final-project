Here she comes, just like an angel
Seems like forever that she's been on my mind
But nothing has changed
She thinks I'm a waste of her time

There she goes, she don't know what she's missing
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight
I'll do all I can till she understands my desire

I've been on the outside looking in
Let me into your heart - oh
There's nothing on earth that
Should keep us apart, baby
