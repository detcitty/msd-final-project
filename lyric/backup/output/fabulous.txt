Young cat, got back, did a little bid
Now he hard, he buff, he tough, doo rag and timbs
Kinda hard to get a job back out on the block
Charge that to the game

Young girl, she grew up in a rush
Had it bad, no dad, she don't know who to trust
Every man she ever loved only wanna crush
Charge that to the game

But it's all gravy, hey baby
Shots get popped, the cops shut down the party
Jeans sag low, blow smoke out of Dutches
We got love for ya'll, but y'all don't love us

So we swervin' in the suburban, switchin' lanes
Spend up all our dough on them chromey thangs
Name our kids some funny names
Don't hate on us, we're fabulous
