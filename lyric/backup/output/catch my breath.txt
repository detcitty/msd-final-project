I don't wanna be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time

Catching my breath, Letting it go,
Turning my cheek, For the sake of this show
Now that you know, this is my life,
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath,
No one can hold me back,
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath,
Won't let them let me down,
It's all so simple now
