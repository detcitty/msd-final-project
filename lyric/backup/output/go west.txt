Heyhey
well well well well
yeaah

(Together) We will go our way
(Together) We will leave someday
(Together) Your hand in my hand
(Together) We will make the plans

(Together) We will fly so high
(Together) Tell our friends goodbye
(Together) We will start life new
(Together) This is what we'll do

(Go west) Life is peaceful there
(Go west) Lots of open air
(Go west) To begin life new
(Go west) This is what we'll do

(Go west) Sun in winter time
