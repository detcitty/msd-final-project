You had to be the one to say it
You couldn't keep it
Our secret, oh, no

All over town
Everybody's talking
It ain't no secret anymore

You are the one they're saying
And that's phony information
My confidence
You've been betraying

I don't know what
(I don't know what) to do
Because the word is out
	
That you and I are lovers (oh, yeah)
That you and I are lovers
That you and I been getting it on
The word is out

That you and I are lovers (oh, yeah)
That you and I are lovers
That you and I been getting it on
It on, it on, it on, it on

There's nothing left
