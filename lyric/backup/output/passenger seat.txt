Passenger side i slide on in
vinyl seats soft from the heat of the sun
chewin' on a slim jim
can't stop thinkin' bout him
yeah yeah yeah he's the one
(yeah yeah yeah he's the one)
[chorus]
ooooooh ooooooh oooooh
love's so sweet right here
in the passenger seat
ooooooh ooooooh oooooh
yeah, life's so sweet
