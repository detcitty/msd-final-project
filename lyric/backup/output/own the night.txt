Feeling the heat, I can't keep
The pressure off me
Hear the man say, earn your pay
Or I'll let you go today

That's not for me
I was born to be alive
Not livin' to survive
Come closer to me, baby
Make me believe it

I can own the night
Reach up and touch the light
Love still shines
I own the night
You make me come alive
I own the night

Hold back the dawn, turn it on
Love me forever like this
Baby, don't stop, make it hot
I want to taste your burn again

Take me away
To a place I've never known
Livin' right down to the bone
Get closer to me, baby
Make me believe it
