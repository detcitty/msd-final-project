Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party
Starts to come alive

Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues
And hit the city lights

'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of lovin' everywhere
So give me the night, give me the night

You need the evening action
A place to dine, a glass of wine
A little late romance

It's a chain reaction
