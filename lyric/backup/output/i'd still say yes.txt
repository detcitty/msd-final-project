Say yes, say yes
...

Say yes, say yes, say yes
Oh, I love you most
When we share a place
Those special good times together

...
It seems like our love can't get much better, no
...
'Cause we were as close as two could be

...
We knew love could last forever
...

We're more than just lovers
We're good friends
...
And even if our love could drift away
