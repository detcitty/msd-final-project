Baby when I look at you
With your hair fallin' down and your baby blues
Standing there across the room
I get so lost in the way you move

It makes me reminisce
Back to years ago on a night like this
Teary eyed as you took my hand
And I told you that I'd be your man

So many things have come
So many things have gone
One thing that's stayed the same
Is our love's still growing strong

Baby just look at us
All this time and we're still in love
