Sometimes the love rhymes that fill that afternoon,
Lose all their meaning with the rising moon.
Hold me and tell me that the words you say are true,
Answer the question I must ask of you ...

Do you wanna make love,
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down,
If you try and fool yourself.
Do you wanna make love,
