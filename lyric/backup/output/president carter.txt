God bless America
President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter

President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as god as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pocket pissin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Told tools like mechanics, mechanism
Uh, Detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu

I like my short cake shorter
