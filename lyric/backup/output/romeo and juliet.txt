It's like Romeo and Juliet
Hot sex on a platter just to get you wet
You's about to get in something you will never regret
And it's gonna be the bomb, this is what I bet, yep
It's like Romeo and Juliet
Hot sex on a platter just to get you wet
You's about to get in something you will never regret
And it's gonna be the bomb, this is what I bet, yep
Since the first time I saw ya, I knew I was attracted
Reacted to the fact, on how you make me act
Shy but sexy at the same time, all was on my mind was a little bump n grind
Usually I don't play it that close
You gots to kick it with me before I serve you up with an overdose
Of that bomb-ass punanny, make you my man
I ain't got no love for nobody else but you, cause you my boo
I prove to you, my love be true
So do you know where you're going to
Through thick and thin baby, you all in
Time will reveal that my love for you will never end
My heart keeps tickin', no time for trickin'
You who I'm pickin', so lay me down
Just give it a good lickin'
I'll treat you like my king cause you're royal
And only give my love to you because I'm loyal
