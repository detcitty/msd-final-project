You imagine when you see her
that she's nothing less that perfect
That she has no aspirations
Beyond driving in her car
The car she looks so good in
Will she ever look that good again
you'll never have to know
Because she's gone

She passes in the left lane
And you're turned on by the chase
Her hair flies in the wind
As your mind begins to race
The grass is always greener
But I wish you could have seen her
