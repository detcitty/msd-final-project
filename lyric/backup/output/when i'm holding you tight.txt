I get this feeling
Whenever I touch you
I kept believing
That some day you'd feel it too
You kept the fire burning deep in my heart
I never knew

You played along, and took what you needed
I was wrong to think I could ever get through
You've got this way of making your love slip through

When I'm holding you tight
When I'm holding you tight
Now girl
I can't let you know
That I'm on to ya
I can't let you go
And make it so that

When I'm holding you tight
Baby it's when I'm holding you tight
Now girl
I can't let you know
That I'm on to ya
