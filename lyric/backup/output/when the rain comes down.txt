There's a change of heart
And you're in a race
And you don't know
Where it ends

In another world
Where you're upside down
Trying to make amends

Whoa, I don't believe
What I see and I hear
Whoa, I can't explain
What is here but it's here
Whoa, oh

When the rain comes down
When the rain comes down
Time to start
