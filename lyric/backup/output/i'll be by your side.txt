When you look inside yourself you will discover
You'll learn to appreciate the only one
Who truly cares for you
Soon you'll see in life as you get older
You'll learn to understand I'm the only one
Who'll truly die for you

And you know when we go through these changes
Nothing can separate our love
When you feel that we are being strangers
Know this is coming from my heart

And I'll be by your side, baby
When you need shelter from the storm
When you need someone to keep you warm
'Cause I'll be by your side
