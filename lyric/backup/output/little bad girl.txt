Oh yeah
They tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want bad girl dancing over there

Look at her go on the dancefloor
She's amazing on the dancefloor
When she moves girl I want more
Keep it going girl â€“ like I got an encore
You got me saying:

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, go little bad girl

Oh yeah
They tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want bad girl dancing over there

Shaking her ass from the left to the right
Moving it. round just the way that I like
I wanna see her move like a movie on flight
