Yeah, yeah, yeah

Girl, I'll do anything for you
'Cause you that made my dream come true
And I'd really like to know you better

When I looked into your eyes
It took me by surprise
All I saw was love and emotion
Girl, let's run away
Just you and I today
Girl, I want your total devotion

Let me love you, girl, forever more
I love you, baby
Let me love you, girl, forever more
I love you, baby

Baby, there's nothing like kissing you
That's all I really want to do
