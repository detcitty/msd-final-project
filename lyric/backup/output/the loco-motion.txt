All aboard!
The loco-motion
The loco-motion

Everybody's doing a brand new dance now
(Come on baby do the loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it
If you give it a chance now
(Come on baby do the loco-motion)

My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learning your ABC's
So come on, come on
Do the loco-motion with me

You got to swing your hips now
Come on baby, jump up, hmmm jump back
