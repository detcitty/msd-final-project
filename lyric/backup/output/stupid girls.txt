Stupid girl
(Woo)
Stupid girls
Stupid girls
Maybe if I act like that

That guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girls (yeah)
I don't wanna be a stupid girl (uhhuh)

Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there

Laughing loud, so all the little people stare
Looking for a daddy, to pay for the champagne

Droppin' names
What happened to the dream of a girl president?

She's dancing in the video Next to 50 (Â¢) Cent

They travel in packs of two and three
With their itsy bitsy doggies, and their teeny-weeny tees
Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?

Oh where, oh where could they be?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maybe if I act like that (woo)

That guy will call me back (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Porno paparazzi girls
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
