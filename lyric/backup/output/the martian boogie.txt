The other night I was
Walking down the street
I was getting kinda hungry
I decided to get me something to eat

Now I passed up all the chain
Franchise joints on Hamburger row
And stopped at a little greasy spoon place
I always eat at called Eat, Sit and Gulp

Get you one of the greasy hamburgers
All peppered up, lay you up in the
Hospital for about ten days

So I ordered me up a
Couple of those grease bombs
Waitress brought 'em over
Lifted up the bun, checked 'em out
Damn, no ketchup

So I nudged the guy sitting next to me
At the counter, I said, hey, partner
How about passing the ketchup over
