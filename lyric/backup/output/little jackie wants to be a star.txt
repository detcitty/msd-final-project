Oh, Little Jackie
Alright

Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star

She got off a Greyhound in search of fortune and fame
Hopin to find a better way and leave her troubles behind
But little did she know that life was sometimes touch and go
Some never get it, open your eyes or you'll learn to regret it

Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star
She's caught in the middle -- Of reality and what she's dreamin of
Oh, Little Jackie she wants to be a star
Smack dab in the middle of -- Oh, growin up
