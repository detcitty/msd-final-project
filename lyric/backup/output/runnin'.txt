Can't keep runnin' away

I must admit on some occasions I went out like a punk
And a chump or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect, I used to never get when all I got was upset
When niggas use to be like what's up fool?

And tried to seat a nigga like the lip for no reason at all
I can recall crip niggas throwin' C in my face down the hall
I'm kickin' it in the back of the school, eatin' chicken at three
Wonderin' why is everybody always pickin' on me

I tried to talk and tell them chill, I did nothing to deserve this
But when it didn't work I wasn't scared just real nervous
