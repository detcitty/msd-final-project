I was on a heavy tip
Tryna cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side
Like always, wondering what to do with life
I already had a sip
So I'd reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side
Like always, you could never make your mind

And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion
That lasted 20 years
What kind of man loves like this
