Don't waste your time
She's my friend
I tell you
She ain't no good

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah

I can't stand to see someone
Take advantage of you
Knowing I care about you
The way I do

So don't waste your time
She's my friend
And I tell you she ain't no good
Don't waste your time
She's my friend
And I tell you she ain't no good

She calls me on the phone
Each and every night
Bragging how she takes love
But never gives it back

So don't waste your time
She's my friend
And I tell you she ain't no good
Don't waste your time
She's my friend
And I tell you she ain't no good

She told me that she loves me
She told me that she needed me
(No good)
She said I was the only one
(Don't waste your time)
And now you're saying
She's only out for fun

She don't love you
She don't love you
She don't love you like I do

She don't love you
(Are you sure)
She don't love you
