Don't fuck no bitch that's fucking with your dawg, that's law
If you come up don't forget about your dawgs, that's law
I'm a street nigga so its fuck the law
If you broke nigga that should be against the law
Fuck no bitch that's fucking with your dawg, that's law
If you come up don't forget about your dawgs, that's law
I'm a street nigga so its fuck the law
If you broke nigga that should be against the law

I'm a real hustler so don't knock it, that's law
Its all about the re-up and the profit, that's law
Can't be in the club without no bottles, that's law
We gon' ball today fuck tomorrow, that's law
I be in the kitchen whipping trying to cook the sauce
If you sat down to talk, then nigga you the law
Balmain mannequin I'm fresher than a doll
Look so damn fresh that shit should be against the law
I'm living my life like the rules of the game and they calling the 40 a law
Money with money with all of my homies ain't fucking with none of these broads
Hustling just to show out for these bitches you lost
In love but you ain't never got the pussy you want

Head on first night we need to turn that to law
Love at first sight man I don't fuck with that at all

Bitches can't be beefing 'bout no niggas, that's law
