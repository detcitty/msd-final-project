Oh well, I'm the type of guy
Who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are
Well, you know that I'm around

I kiss em and I love em
Cause to me they're all the same
I hug em and I squeeze em
They don't even know my name

They call me the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam, around, around
Around, around

Oh well, there's Flo on my left
And there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl
Well, that I'll be with tonight
