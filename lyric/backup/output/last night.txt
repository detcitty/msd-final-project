You make me burn with fever
make me jump and shout
you really make me lose control
and when you pull my lever
it turns me all about
i feel it way down in my soul
Last night
we turned the power on
last night
'till the break of dawn (oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh)
last night
we got into the groove
last night
we made that move
I could be your puppet
you could pull my string
'cause you make me feel so real
you keep me jumpin'
keep my whole heart pumpin'
i love the way you make me feel
Last night
