You gotta get together...

Love is but a song we'll sing
And feels the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or making just cry
Though the bird is on the wing
And you may not know why

C'mon people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

Some will come and some will go
And we shall surely pass
When the one that left us here
