Yeh!
I say starighten yuh crooked ways
Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly
Selassie I liveth everytime (me sing!)
After me lef from Jamaica go a foreign pon tour
Preaching teaching the people fi sure
Answer to Jah when him a knock pon your door
If yuh ignore yuh goin perish fi sure
Come back in Jamaica, everything insecure
Rich a get rich and the poor a get poor
Come back come hear say Panhead skull bore
Come back an hear say Dirtsman skull bore
Hear say John Pope Paul all a come yah pon tour
DJ dung yah a brandish mi what more
Boogerman ah plan all fi guh march and tour
Tour Kingston and all go tour Portmore
But me know de whole a dem would a-must dead fi sure
And de DJ dem nah teach people no more
A pure clashing and fighting dem no unite no more
Alla tell de girls girl dem fi bruck out like a sore
It seems like the people dem no love God no more
If Slackness a the sickness then Culture a the cure
Ice all mi block and all a whole city!
Chorus
After mi come back a Jamaica nuff things gone wrong
