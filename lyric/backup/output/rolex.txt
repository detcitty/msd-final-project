I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch

Yeah, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me
Now your chick all on me, now your chick all on me (she on me)

My Rollie don't tick tock, it just glide
Keep starin' at it and you might go blind
I be movin' clean, I don't even try
All I see is bands, bands, I spy
Yeah, dat way
I need that moola by Tuesday
Yeah, dat way
