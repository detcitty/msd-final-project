I got your love
You need to look no further
Don't you know that
Don't you know that

After my love
You'll never need another
Don't you know that
Don't you know that

I don't make no promises I can't keep
And I promised myself that I'd love you forever
How many times must I say that
For you to understand the real thing

Don't you know that I love you so
Baby, don't you know
Don't you know that
I love you so, ooh, don't you know
Don't you know that
Oh

Without a doubt
