Bye, Bye, Bye
Bye, Bye...
Bye, Bye...
Oh, Oh.
I'm doin' this tonight

You're probably gonna start a fight.
I know this can't be right.
Hey baby come on
I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me.
So now it's time to leave and make it alone
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye...

Bye Bye

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye...
Bye Bye
