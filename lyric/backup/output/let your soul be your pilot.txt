Let your soul, be your pilot
Let your soul, guide you
He'll guide you well

When you're down and they're counting
When your secrets, all found out
When your troubles, take to mounting
When the map you have, leads you to doubt
When there's no Information and the compass turns
To nowhere that you know well

Let your soul, be your pilot
Let your soul, guide you
He'll guide you well

When the doctor failed to heal you
When no medicine chest, can make you well
