Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Lets whisper, let's don't talk
Baby, leave my T-shirt in the hall

Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we'll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It's time we made it happen

Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
