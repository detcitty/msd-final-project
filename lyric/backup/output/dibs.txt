I know everybody wants you
That ain't no secret
Hey baby what's your status?
And tell me are you trynna keep it?
Well, they can all back off
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got your attention
Did I mention:
If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take
heyy
If you got a heart that ain't afraid to love
Ain't afraid to break
heyy
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah
I'll calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
