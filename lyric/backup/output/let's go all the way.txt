Sitting with the thinker
Just trying to work it out
It's a traffic jam of the brain
Makes you want to scream and shout

Presidential party
No one wants to dance
Looking for a new star
To put you in a trance

Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Let's go all the way

Workin' in a factory
