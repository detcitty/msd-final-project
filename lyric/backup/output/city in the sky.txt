There's too many people
Tellin' too many lies
I'm gonna have to build them
A city in the sky
Where I can fly away, yeah

A city so high
Won't have it no other way, no
I sure ain't gonna miss
The city I leave behind
Drag out the drag
It's blowin' my mind away

There's been too many children
With tears in their eyes
