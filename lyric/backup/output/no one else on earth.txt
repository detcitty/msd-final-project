I've been a rock and I've got my fences
I never let them down
When it comes to love I keep my senses
I don't get kicked around

I shivered once you broke into my soul
The damage is done now
I'm outta control
How did you get to me

No one else on earth
Could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like you
