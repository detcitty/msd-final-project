I ain't even know it (even know it)
Even know it (Know it)
Teddy partied to the stage
Seen a nigga throw it (nigga throw it)
Th- throw it (throw it)
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nothing

Black car, party in the back yard
Shorty got the black bra showing (black bra showing)
Tatted up, ass fat enough
She a bad bitch and she already know it (Yeah she know it)
Yeah she know it, Yeah yeah she know it
She a bad bitch and she already know it (Yeah she know it)
Yeah she know it, Yeah yeah she know it
She gon' make me spend some money on it

Whole bank account and I'll blow it

Go do a show then
With some more ends
Pockets bigger than a Samoan
I'm at the stage every time shorty go in
Shorty go in, shorty shorty go in
Booty hit the floor then
Slow motion

I'm so gone off Patrone
I don't know how I'm getting home later on like

I ain't even know it (even know it)
Even know it (Know it)
Teddy partied to the stage
Seen a nigga throw it (nigga throw it)
Th- throw it (throw it)
Throwing that ass for days
