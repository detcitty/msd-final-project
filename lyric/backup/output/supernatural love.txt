We were strangers
who one were lovers
we've been everlasting friends

I was shattered
when you walked out, boy
I was walking off the edge

Friends, said I looked so down-hearted
when you left
now my broken heart is stable
I'm starting to mend
got you back and I'm living again

Oh, this must be love
