can't believe I'm here
Down at the q's jook joint (no doubt)
It sure is happenin' y'all (on this remix)
But listening to this music
Kinda makes me think about when I used to listen to slow jams
Back in the day (yeah)
Like babyface, whip appeal (no doubt)
Or r. kelly, bump and grind
But you know what (what? )
Sometimes when I'm just layin' down with my man (yeah)
I get the feelin' I need to hear a little barry white (no doubt)
Show you right (show you right)
Then there are other times when I just need a little sexual healing
Of marvin gaye (it's the now, baby)
(remix)
What about some teddy pendergrass? (no doubt)
Close the door and turn out the lights (remix)

Feels so good baby, yeah
Yes (ah)
Yeah baby
(remix) baby (slow jams, remix)
Baby, oh yeah
(babyface)

Baby dim the lights
