Jenny came over and told me 'bout Brad
He's such a hairy behemoth she said
Dumb as a box of hammers
But he's such a handsome guy

And I opened up and I told her 'bout Larry
And yesterday how he asked me to marry
And I'm not giving him an answer yet
I think I can do better

So we laughed
Compared notes
We had a drink
We had a smoke
She took off her overcoat

I kissed a girl
