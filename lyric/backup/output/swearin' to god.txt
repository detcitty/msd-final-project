(ooooo) Swearin' to God
There's no one else on earth I'd rather be
Mmmmmm... Swearin' to God
You made me see so I believed in me
Oh you've been fillin' my cup
'Til I'm runnin' over with joy
From you heaven sent love
Just touch me again
I'm king of all men... and reigning from above

Swearin' to God (Swearin' to God)
