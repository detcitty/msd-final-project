Girl you know I love talking to you on the phone
I could listen to your sweet voice all night long
And sometimes I could get by
With the sweet dreams baby good night
But this time, well I don't wanna spend it alone

So I'm coming over, I hope it's alright
Listen for me pulling into your drive
Look out your window, you'll see my lights
Baby girl I gotta see you tonight
The way the breeze was blowing, blowing
Got me wishing I was holding, holding
On to you so tight under that porch light
Yeah, girl I gotta see you tonight
