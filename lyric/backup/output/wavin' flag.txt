Ooooooh Wooooooh, Ooooooh Wooooooh
Give me freedom!
Give me fire!
Give me reason!
Take me higher!
See the champions. Take the field now!
You define us, make us feel proud
oul'lela alam oul we sam'ma
(tell the world and let them hear)
di ahla forsa'shan netgama'
(that's the best occasion to gather)
we wettna fi lammetna
(and our strenght in our gathering)
binheba ba'd awi we benshagga'
(we love each other so much and cheer)
tashgae'na egabii'aba
(our cheer is of course postive)
