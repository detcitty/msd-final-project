I am nothing without love
I'm but a ship stuck in the sand
Some would say that I'm all alone
But I am, I'm nothing without love

I wanna hold her in my arms
She feelin' alone, she feelin' sad
I would take credit for what's wrong,
But I am, I'm nothing without love

Three years at sea after the storm
And this sinking ship-love you put me on
God, I wish a gust of wind would come
And carry me home
