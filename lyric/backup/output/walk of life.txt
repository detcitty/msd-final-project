Woohoo, woohoo.

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay

He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion.
He turnin' all the night time into the day
