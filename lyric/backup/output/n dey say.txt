yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
let's go
(ha-haha-ha-ha)
ohhhhh
N Dey Say
ohhhhhh oh ohhhh

hold up, stop now, let me get a look 'cha
damn girl i aint seen u since prom
come to think about it cant believe it's been that long
i heard your man locked down now
how long he gone? oh, dat long
how the hell he get time like that
3 strikes for possesion aww he ain't coming back
he left you with two kids and bills all around
plus you found out he had another chick cross town
it's always the darkest right before the sun rises
and you gotta stay strong for the kids in they eyes'n
please dont despise and go against all brothers
and have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another
i hate to sound 2pac-ish li'l mama keep your head up
but your gonna make it i promise you keep your head up
and that that dont kill you only makes you stronger
and the will to succeed only feed the hunger
fo' reel (fo' reel, fo' reel)
