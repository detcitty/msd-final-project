Just my dog and I
at the edge of the universe.
Well, I didn't wanna bring her
and I know it'll make her worse.

Now I look out on forever
and it must be nice down there.
And they call me Shenandora in the air.

Well, I'm ten feet tall,
but I'm only three feet wide.
And I live inside an ocean that flows
on the other side.

If I came back down tomorrow,
would it all be far too soon?
