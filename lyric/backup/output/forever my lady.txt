oooo-whoah
whoah-oooo yeah

Forever 3x

So you're having my baby
And it means so much to me
There's nothing more precious
Raise a family
IF there's any doubt in your mind
you can count on me
I'll never let you down
Lady believe in me

Hook

You & I
We'll never fall apart
You & I
We knew that from the start - Baby
The day
We fell so far in love
