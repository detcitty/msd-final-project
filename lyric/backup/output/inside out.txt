When you're sitting on your own
And you feel the city life surround you
And she's always on the phone
But you just don't think that you can fight it

Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up
(Don't give up)
Don't give up, don't give up, darling, what you dream

'Cause like the words here in this song
We'll go on and on and on with our love

(I wanna be)
Inside out, oh, darling
I want it to be so deep that you'll be turning me
(Inside out)
I want it to be so deep you'll be needing me

When you're lying in her bed
And you're in her arms instead of my love
As you feel her tightening grip
