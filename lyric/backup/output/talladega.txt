It was the summer before the real world started and,
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running,
Daddy's old Winnebago

Wing and a prayer down 65,
Five best friends on four bald tires,
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it

To Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up,
