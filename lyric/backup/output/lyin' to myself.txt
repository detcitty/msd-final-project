D. Cassidy/S. Shifrin
 
 So I'll never feel your touch again
 I'll get used to it
 Hearts don't break they just bend
 I'll come bouncing back
 You barely left a scratch on me
 
 You were nothing
 But a little plaything
 And your love bite
 It was only a sting
 Baby when you went 
 It hardly made a dent in me
