I watch the distant lights on the runway
Disappear into the evening sky
Oh you know I'm with you on your journey
Never could say goodbye

It's not the sun you're trying to find
Something else is on your mind
You need a little space and time
To break away
It's not the place you're going to
It's just a phase you're going through
