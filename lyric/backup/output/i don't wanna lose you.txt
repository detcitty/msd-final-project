Listen, listen to my heartbeat
Listen, listen to my heartbeat
Baby, listen

I don`t wanna lose you
As a matter of fact
I can`t stand to lose you

When I say I love you, yeah
This time, you can believe me
Yes, you can

I can`t blame you if you
Wanna leave me, no, no
After all, I`m the one
Who deceived you

But I`m just here
To let you know
Never, ever, will I
Want to let you go

I don`t wanna lose you
Oh, help me say it, somebody
