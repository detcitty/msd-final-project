Look around
There's no one but you and me
Right here and now
The way it it was meant to be
There's a smile on my face
Knowing that together everything that's in our way
Were better than alright

Walking between the raindrops
Riding the aftershock we stand cool
Off into the sunset
Living like there's nothing left to lose
Chasing after gold mines
