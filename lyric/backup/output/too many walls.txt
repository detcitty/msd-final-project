Wish on a rainbow, is all I can do
Dream of the good times that we never knew
No late nights, alone in your arms
I'll dream on
Living in wonder, thinking of you
Still looking for ways to uncover the truth
You're so young, is all they can say
They don't know
If I could change the way of the world
I'd be your girl
