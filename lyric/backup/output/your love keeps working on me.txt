I was so lonely
I was left with no one to call my own
Then you came along, boy
And saved my heart from turning to stone

Baby, you and your lovely smile
Opened my heart wide as a country mile
Like a bird that had broken wings
Through you I have learned how to fly

I don't know what you do to me
When I think about you, yeah, it sets me free
I don't know what you do to me
But I'm gonna tell you, baby
Your love keeps working on me

Could I be dreaming?
I don't wanna wake up and find you gone
I never imagined, baby
That I feel like a queen on the throne
