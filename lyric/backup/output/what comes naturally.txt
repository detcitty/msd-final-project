Let's get together and do
What comes naturally

I've been holding back my love
For such a long time
Nobody's come along that
I would want to call mine

My phone's been ringing but
My heart, it just wont answer
I can't pretend cause
It's love I'm after

(I've been looking)
I was not prepared for
What I saw in your eyes
I saw something I've been
Waiting for a long time

(Let's get together)
We just met but I know
That you're no stranger
I can tell that
My heart's in danger

I've been looking for you
You've been looking for me
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally
There's a time to be wild
There's a time to be free
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally

I could play hard to get
But what good would that do me
You'd look into my eyes and
You would see right through me
