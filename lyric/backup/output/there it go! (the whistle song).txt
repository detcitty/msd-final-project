(Ay)
It's Dipset
There it go
Baby don't stop now
There it go
Baby don't stop now

There it go
Damn shorty look good
And I'm thinkin' ‘bout gettin' at her
Okay, time to whistle at her
Ay girl you make my whistle blow
There it go
Bring it here baby
There it go
Bring it here baby
Top down and I'm at it again
It's hot now and I'm at it to win
You heard me
Who want it with me?
Nobody wanna it with me
Oh I'm so fly
Oh Mami come ‘n get me
Sit it down
Back up
Bring it on back up
Move it ‘til you feel something hard in your back up
There it go
If you want it, come and get it
I aint kiddin', I'm wit it
