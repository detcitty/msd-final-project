She's getting dressed up, putting on that lipstick
She be shaking, riding to them cut-offs baby, oh yeah
You're getting off work, cashing out that paycheck
Gotta change that shirt and pick that girl up on her front step
Here she comes now looking so fine
You've been waiting for this night for such a long, long time

She slides in and you rode down main street
You turn right when that red light turns green
Sun sets now you're half way to heaven
