I was lying there
Lying on the beach
I dreamed you were there
Feel the heat
The sun and the waves
When you touch my hand
We were on a desert island
And I had a dream
I was swept away

You and I are on an island
Where I thought the storm would never end
I saw your light on the horizon
And I knew that I was blown away again

No it doesn't matter
Yeah, it doesn't matter
'Cause nothing lasts forever
'Cause nothing last forever
