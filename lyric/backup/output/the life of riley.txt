Lost in the Milky Way
Smile at the empty sky and wait for
The moment a million chances may all collide
I'll be the guiding light
Swim to me through stars that shine down
And call to the sleeping world as they fall to Earth

So here's your life
We'll find our way
We're sailing blind
But it's certain nothing's certain

I don't mind
I get the feeling
You'll be fine
I still believe that
In this world
We've got to find the time
For the life of Riley
