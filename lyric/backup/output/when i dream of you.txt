Tears start falling when I dream of you
Can't help myself, you're far away with someone else
And I will never find another girl
Who makes me feel, the way you do
When I dream of you

And I've been seeing, the same visions night after night
Till the morning light
As my soul starts to ache
My heart starts to break in two
