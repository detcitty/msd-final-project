Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm walking on air
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm walking on air

You're giving me sweet, sweet ecstasy
Yeah you take me to utopia
You reading me like erotica
Boy you make me feel exotic yeah

Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and harder
Than ever before
We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there

I'm walking on air
Tonight
I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air
Tonight
