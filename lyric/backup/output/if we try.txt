When I see you on the street, I lose my concentration. Just the thought that we
might meet creates anticipation.

Won't you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you ought to
know. Well I've been thinkin' about you day and night... and I don't know if
it'll work out right... but somehow I think that it just might... if we try.
