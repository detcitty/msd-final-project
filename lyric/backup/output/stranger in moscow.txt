Stranger In Moscow
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me be

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
