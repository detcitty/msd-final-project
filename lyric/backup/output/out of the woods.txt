Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember

You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color

And I remember thinking...

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)

Uh, your necklace hanging from my neck
