This has got to be the saddest day of my life
I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you anymore
Because of my obligations and the ties that you have

We've been meeting here everyday
And since this is our last day together
I wanna hold you just one more time

When you turn and walk away, don't look back
I wanna remember you just like this
