You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish

Standing on the field with your pretty pom-pom
Now you're working at the movie selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
'Cause I'm putting down my story in a popular song

I said I'm putting down my story in a popular song

My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, 'cause my song is popular

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were

Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
