Falling in love
It was easy at the start
I thought I had it in my hands

Something went wrong
Somewhere we lost a part
It was more than
We could stand, yeah

It was too late when I realized
That I couldn't see
The forest for the trees
What was wrong with me

There comes a time in every life
Love will come your way
And if it should stay
