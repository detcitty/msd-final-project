Missy don't think she's pretty no more
Starin' at the stars through her back screen door
She tries and tries to make it all work out
No matter what she does
She's left standin' in the middle of doubt
In a lonely night
And in the pourin' rain
You can count on me

Sometimes she cries
When she's alone at night
Sometimes she weeps
When she's feelin' cold and weak
Sometimes the pain
