You ain't got no whip, you ain't got no bottle.
Let's just be honest, let's just be real.
You ain't got no cash, you ain't got no dollas.
You stay with that drama, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, let's just be real
Let's just be honest, let's just be real

Uh, just keep it real with ya
You the only nigga in here feeling yourself
Walk in, them bitches start filming
They sittin' with a man, thotty ass still grinning, it's on
Honest, so hot, mind on a comet
Fast life sometimes feel like I'm in a comic
I don't give a fuck, bitch with or without a tonic
