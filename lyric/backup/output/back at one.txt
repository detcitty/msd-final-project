It's undeniable that we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real
If all things in time, time will reveal, yeah
One, you're like a dream come true

Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
