It's nothing I can put my finger on
But it's there, I swear
It's not somethin' I'm imaginin'
Each time you call
I know I'll get your "working late routine" again

Is there someone I should know about?
Tell me why do I have this doubt?

I'm sure your alibis are water tight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Oh, but I know you're slipping away from me
I'm know your alibis are water tight
And you're where you say you are tonight
