Zone six!

I got money that I saved then I'm back on road
Get my jewelry out the safe cause I'm back on road
I still do these hoes the same when I'm back on road
If you wasn't there for me when I was all alone
Then btich don't expect no love when I'm back

I'm just an East Atlanta nigga with a body on this belt
I done had a million beefs but I ain't never call for help
I'll take a nigga bricks and I done took a nigga reup
Put that pistol on your partner made him piss all on himself
Got your bitch so pissy drunk
That she done threw up on herself
