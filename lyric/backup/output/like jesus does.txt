I'm a long gone Waylon song gone by,
I'm a backroads sinner at a tent revival,
She believes in me like she believes her bible,
And loves me like Jesus does.

I'm a left foot leaning on a suped up Chevy,
I'm a good ol' boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee,
But she carries me, when my sins make me heavy,
