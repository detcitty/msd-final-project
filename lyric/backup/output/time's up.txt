Yeah, yo, I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail 'cause them years will cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a Dutch
Think how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the cocaine over customs

Never underestimate niggaz or over trust them
Uh, yeah them M's is right in my face
I just gotta throw my timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the tech will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
'Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't shake the Devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what

The time to talk is up so bring the heat, that time is over
