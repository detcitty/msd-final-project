I just be like fuck you, what you need?
You can't get nothin' from me
You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be
I'ma do my thing until the day the reaper come for me
You can keep on grillin', I'ma smile back, smile back
(Just tell 'em Mac)

Call your army, bring your tanks, I'm a big boy with a big boy bank
Self-employed, independent, once you start, don't take no breaks
Work until I get it, I bet it's gon' take a second
But once I start up my engine I'm gone, too fast to catch him
