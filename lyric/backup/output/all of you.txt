(T. Renis/J. Iglesias/C. Weil)
with Diana Ross
I've never had this feeling before
I've never wanted anyone more
And something in your eyes tells me
You feel the way that I do
(I feel like you do)
If you would like to stay here all night
You know that I would say
It's all right
'Though I'm saying yes
I confess
I've got more on my mind
