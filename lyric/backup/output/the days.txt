Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance, and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

Heartache, heartbreak, all over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together

These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these, who could ask for more?
