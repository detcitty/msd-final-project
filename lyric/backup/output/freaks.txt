(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you late at night
(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you late at night
(The world has too many freaks)
I can freak you in the morning, freak you in the evening
Freak you late at night
I can freak you on the counter, freak you on the table
Freak you right now, 'cause I can't wait to freak you later

[Play]
I wanna, lick, lick, lick you naw never that
To the bedroom give me head room 
straight to the point my time to clown,
Let you know from the gate I don't go downtown
To many freaks that'll please me
I'm that playa you better believe
I'm payin' on cheese, but I guarantee
That I still got a freak everyday of the week
I love feeling when you dealing with someone
Pumping' them holes in your body all night long
My keep gets bigger when you giving me dome
And I get a little crazy when its time to bone
Ma I like that you think that I was one of a kind
And my ice made you think that love was blind
Separate the greats, from the weak freaks
I would never hate, I love all my freaks
But I never bone, never let a hoe know that I
Gotta a lot of dough, she ain't gotta know
Take her to the room, I don't need your voice
But I might need your mouth to provide the moist
Didn't think you had it right till i met your needs 
And swallowed my seeds and now I see
Why choose one freak when?
