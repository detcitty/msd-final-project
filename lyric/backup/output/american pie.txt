A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so
Now do you believe in rock 'n roll
And can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow

Well I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm 'n blues
