Come as you are
You're a superstar
World in your pocket and you know it
You can feel that beat

Runnin' through your feet
Heart's racing faster
Rock 'n rollin'

All that you need is the music
To take you to
Some other place
Where you know

You belong
Raise your hands up in the air and scream
We're finding our voice
Followin' our dreams
Cause we rock, we rock, we rock, we rock on

Nobody in the world's gonna bring us down
The louder we go
Well, the better we sound
Cause we rock, we rock, we rock, we rock on
