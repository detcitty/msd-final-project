Using our private life
We plan for the quiet night
'Round whispers and lover's sighs

And it was so personal
It sounded so personal

And when we're face to face
Let not a moment waste
I feel like it's lover's fate

'Cause it's so personal
Sincerely personal

Seems like the stronger falls
Stronger than you and me
We'll let it take it's course
Building intensity

Inside love
Just the two of us in our love
 (Living in that love)
Inside love
