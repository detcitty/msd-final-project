Last night, when the moon was new, I couldn't sleep, I was thinkin' of you
And how much I need ya, how about that

Yeah, I act like I'm tougher than steel
With a heart like a stone, but you know it ain't real
I need you baby, how about that, hey

Oooh, how about that

I used to spend my life on the town, it took your lovin' to turn me around
I'm crazy about you, how about that

Yeah, people used to tell ya I'm a crazy fool
