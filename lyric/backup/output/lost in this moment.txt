See your mama and the candles and the tears and roses
I see your daddy walk his daughter down the aisle
And my knees start to tremble as I tell the preacher
Don't she look beautiful tonight?

All the wonderful words in my head I've been thinkin'
You know I wanna say 'em all just right
I lift your veil and angels start singing
Such a heavenly sight, yeah

Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
My feeling's so absolute
