There's many a day I act free
We're oceans apart
Even though my tears have dried
There's an emptiness I feel in my heart
Come forward

Uh, from the first time that I loved you
I told you from the start
Our love would come together
If we could stand to be apart
I never mean to break to you heart, no

The days I cope without you
I feel so all alone
I see you in my dreams at night
I feel your touch so strong (So strong)
I feel your pain and tears miles away
I surrender my soul to you, dear
