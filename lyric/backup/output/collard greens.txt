Oh, oh, luxury, chidi-ching-ching could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens, three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit, drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit, aye
Oh, oh, down with the shit, cop this, pop this, down with the shit

Oh, oh, luxury, chidi-ching-ching could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens, three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh,

Smoke this, drink this, straight to my liver

Watch this, no tick, yeah, I'm the nigga
Gang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots I deliver
Faded, Vegas, might sponsor the killer
Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter
Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object
Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiending
Give me, give me, give me some
Freak the freckles off your face, frenchy, freaking, swapping tongue
Click my link and spread your buns, loose your denim, make it numb
Blow it baby, no Saddam (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
