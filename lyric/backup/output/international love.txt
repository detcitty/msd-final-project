You put it down like New York City
I never sleep!
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy!
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Ohh, Miss International love
Ohh, Miss International love

(I don't play football but i touch down everywhere
everywhere?, everywhere
I don"t play baseball but i hit a home run everywhere
everywhere?, everywhere)

I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed
In Romania she pulled me to the side and told me Pit you can have me and my sister
In Lebanon yeah the women are bomb
And in Greece you've guessed it the women are sweet
