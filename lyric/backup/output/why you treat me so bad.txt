Why you treat me so bad
why you treat me so bad
why you treat me so bad
why you treat me so bad
why you treat me so bad baby
Oh girl i loved you but you turned and you walked away
i would love you for tomorrow though i know i do today
told me that you'd never hurt me, girl you just tore my life apart
tell me baby, why'd you do it, won't you bring me back my heart
I tried to understand it baby, i searched my heart inside my mind
i searched the depths of my soul baby
there was nothing there to find
you told me that you'd never leave me
girl you just went and told a lie
tell me baby, why'd you do it, why'd you make ah ma want to cry
