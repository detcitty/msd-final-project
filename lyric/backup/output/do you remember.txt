We never talked about it, but I hear the blame was mine
Id've called you up to say I'm sorry
But I wouldn't want to waste your time
Cause I love you, but I can't take anymore
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
If we could try like we tried before
Would you keep on telling me those lies?
Telling me lies
Do you remember?

Well, do you remember?
Do you remember?
There seemed no way to make up
Cause it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me
It's a look I know I'll never forget
