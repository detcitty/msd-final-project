Some things you do really make me mad I must confess
The way the street light silhouettes your thighs inside your dress
Wild child in the streets I think I see you but I really don't know (who
knows)
Goin' a million miles an hour headed out to where the down boys go

Whoa can we rewind to where we've been
ooh I wish you'd take a look and see the shape I'm in
