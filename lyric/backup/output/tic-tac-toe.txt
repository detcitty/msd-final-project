Tic Tac Toe is a game I used to play
When I was little I used to say
I got the X and I got the O
It don't matter 'cause it's Tic Tac Toe

Now I'm a little bit older
I like to play just a little bit bolder
I like gettin' girls and givin' 'em pearls
And their legs across my shoulders

I love to go to the disco
See a fly girl and say hello
They just look me in the eye and pass right by
With that booty shakin' like Jello

I like to speak 'cause that's bein' nice
It makes me mad when I have to speak twice
But that's the game that girls like to play
It's just Tic Tac Toe and roll the other way

X and O, as in yes and no
X and O, as in sex, maybe so
X is for yes and O is for no
X is for sex or maybe so

You might get some if you play this game
