I'm, I'm actually waiting on the bus now
He said we have some kind of special assignment or something
He's supposed to be calling me, like any minute now, any minute
Hold on, hold on, lemme get the phone

Hello? Jackson here
Ya, what, you found Manuel Noreaga in the Philippines?
He has a mansion?
Okay, we on it, on it, right now, right

What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
(What, what, what?)
What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
(What, what, what?)

What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
(What, what, what?)
What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
(What, what, what? Superstar)

What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
(What, what, what?)
What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
(What, what, what?)

What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
(What, what, what?)
What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
(What, what, what? Superstar)

Aiyyo, we light a candle
Run laps around the English channel
Neptunes, I got a Cocker Spaniel
We on the run now, yo, it ain't no fun now
And where I go, you niggas can't even come now

You hate the law, nigga, break it, I don't care
And when ya get caught, remember that I don't care
N.O.R.E., blow you off the atmosphere
Yo, for now, we on the run, yo, if that ain't clear

Weak niggas wanna stick you but that ain't fair
You we down in Vegas, money, skies too courageous
And yo, I'm on the run but still rip stages
And call me Animal Thug when I'm in cages

I used to proof phrases, rolled dice with no aces
Now I'm just included in the oasis
Gotta take faces, no time for car races
