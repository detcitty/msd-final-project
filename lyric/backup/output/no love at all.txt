Read in the paper nearly day
People breakin' up and just walkin' away from love and that's wrong
That's so wrong

A happy little home comes up for sale
Because two fools have tried and failed to get along
And ya know that's wrong

A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man
When neither one of them will love and understa-a-a-a-and
And take it with a grain of salt
Oh, now believe that

A little bit of love is better than no love
Even the bad love is better than no love
And even the sad love is better than no love at a-l-l
Got to believe that
