You make me wanna break my bank
Give everything I got, got just to get a shot, shot
Make it rain
Where my money at? Where my money at?

Break my bank
Forget about the tag, tag, throw it in the bag, bag
Make it rain
Shawty wanna break my, shawty wanna break my bank

Damn, girl, you look better than the videos
Think I wanna break my bank, hammer to the piggie, though
All them groupie girls getting jealous of what I spendin'
Tryna chop it up, but I ain't the karate kid

Jaded, everyday I'm spending more on her
I don't buy shit, like I barely hold the door open
Every time I say this, it always get her one more
When it's time for taxes, a nigga gon' be done for
