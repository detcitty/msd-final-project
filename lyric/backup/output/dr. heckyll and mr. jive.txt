Dr. heckyll works late at the laboratory
where things are not as they seem
dr. heckyll wishes nothing more desperately
than to fulfill his dreams

letting loose with a scream in the dead of night
as he's breaking new ground
trying his best to unlock all the secrets
but he's not sure what he's found

Dr. heckyll is his own little guinea pig
'cos they all think he's mad
