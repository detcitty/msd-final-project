I don't know what's going to happen to you, baby
But I do know that I love you
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky
And I do know that I want you

Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground

You tease me with your loving to play hard to get
