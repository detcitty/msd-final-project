I've been so many places, I've seen so many things
But none quite so lovely as you
More beautiful than the Mona Lisa
Worth more than gold
And my eyes have the pleasure to behold

You're my latest and my greatest
My latest, my greatest inspiration

Things never looked clearer, peace within never felt nearer
My burden's gone, it's turned to a song
Tender as a baby's touch, I needed you, oh, so much
At last the load is so light

You're the latest and my greatest
My latest, my greatest inspiration
