Go, go, go, go
Oh lover, don't you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, you're almost there now
So go lover, make mama proud
And when we're done
I don't wanna feel my legs
And when we're done
I just wanna feel your hands all over me, baby
You can't stop there
Music still playing in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you, baby
So close from here
