Yo, Yo
I want to dedicated this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
'Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he's my father cause my biological
Didn't bother

Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
I thought a child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but your not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad

So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from York to Jersey City
Women and child alone now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Odessa

Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall

She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal

She said you want me you gotta take my son
Or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
