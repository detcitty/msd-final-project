Girl I'm in love with you baby.
And I want you to know.
That I'm hooked on your body.
And I'm trying to be your's.

(Radio killa, killa, killa)
(Oh yessir, yessir)

We beat it up like gorillas
(Trick, where you at? Oh yessir)

She goin' right, she goin' left.
I had her here, to myself.
I got it on it, like I want it.
She rode the beat, like a pony
Cameras up, cameras flash.
I'm tispy, tryna relax.
I wanna change your name to Mrs. Nash.
Cause there's nothing left to say.
