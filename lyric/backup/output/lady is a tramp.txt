(Puck)
She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight 
She adores the theater, and won't arrive late 
She'd never bother, with people she'd hate 
That's why the lady is a tramp

Doesn't like crap games, with barons and earls 
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls 
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls 
That's why the lady is a tramp 

She likes the free, fresh wind in her hair 
Life without care 
She's broke; it's oke
She hates California, it's cold and it's damp 
That's why the lady is a tramp, oh

(Mercedes)
Oh...
