Aw, Cracklin' Rosie, get on board
We're gonna ride
Till there ain't no more to go
Taking it slow
And Lord, don't you know
We'll have me a time with a poor man's lady

Hitchin' on a twilight train
Ain't nothing here that I care to take along
Maybe a song
To sing when I want
No need to say please to no man
