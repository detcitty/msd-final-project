What's the time?
Seems it's already morning.
I see the sky,

it's so beautiful and blue.
The tv's on
but the only thing showing
Is a picture of you.

Oh I get up
and make myself some coffee.
I try to read a bit

but the story's too thin.
I thank the Lord above
You're not here to see me
in this shape I'm in.

Spending my time
