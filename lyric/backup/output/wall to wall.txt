I'm going to need you all to back away from the door
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown

I'm Back
(Pull up, pull up) can't believe the girls, club packed
(What up, what up?) shawty wanna lead me to the back (to the back)
Ain't been in here 15 minutes, got a pocket full of digits
And she just won't take no
(Hold up, hold up) now little mama wanna get mad
(Slow up, slow up) saying she doesn't wanna share what she have (she have)
Ain't no particular one that's getting the water gun
So many that I want

They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

Packed up in here wall to wall and
