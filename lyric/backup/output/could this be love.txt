Staring through the windows of time
Drying off the last year of our bind
Was it real or just a mirage
Love has its way of making you blind
I stared deep into your heart and your soul
And I feel what any woman would want
Why did I run? Why did I hide?
Because the memories bleed on and on

Time goes on and the feelings stay strong
Memories laugh and play with my heart
