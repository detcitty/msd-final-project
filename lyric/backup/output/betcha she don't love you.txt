Betcha` she don`t love you
Like you know I love you (ooh)
And I betcha` she would never do
All the things I do for you

Did she buy you those furs
Does she drive a new car
Have it ever occur to you baby
She might break your heart
Ooohhh,
It won`t be too long
Like the calm that`s before the storm
She`s gonna break your heart

Betcha` she don`t love you
Like you know I love you (ooh)
And I betcha` she would never do
All the things I do for you
