Sometimes in the morning, my coffee gets ice cold
And I'll burn up three cigarettes, before I have my first smoke
Miss my exit on the way to work every now and then
I always blame it on the traffic when they ask me where I've been

And in a crowded elevator, I'll start hummin' that ol' song
There's no way of knowin' when that urge will come along
I've been stuck in some meeting, looked down at my legal pad
