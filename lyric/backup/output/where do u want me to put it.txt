[Verse 1:]
Time to get off
Let's get it on
Anytime you're in the mood to groove give me a call
Just say the word
I'll be right there
Baby I'm gon fill you up with tender love and care
It's all to make you feel good
To carry you to ecstasy
If you give me directions
Communicate to me

[Chorus:]
Where
Do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do
Cause you're startin to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
