There will never be any peace
Until God is at the conference table
There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
(He? s at the conference table)

Men are runnin? from land to land
Tryin? to make things alright
Holding meeting after meeting, constantly reaching
For what they maybe thinking is right

Everybody has a plan
Ain? t that just a man
People can? t you understand?
We gotta tell? em

There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
(He? s at the conference table)

There will never be any peace
Until God is seated at the conference table
(He? s at the conference table)
