oOh ohohhoh
I feel like new sunglasses
Like a brand new pair of jeans
I feel like taking chances
I feel a lot like seventeen
ohoohhh
I feel like windows rolled down
New city streets and cabs
I feel like anything happen
Laughing you take me right back
to when we were kids
Never thought I'd feel like this
Like when I close my eyes
and don't even care if anyone sees me dancing
Like I can fly
