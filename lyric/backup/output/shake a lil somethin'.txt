Okay man, are you ready to go?
I'm ready to go, now c'mon now
Crank this motherfucker up
Yeah, it's ya boys back in the house
We want y'all to get y'ass on the motherfuckin' dance floor
All you raggedy-ass hoes, get y'ass out!

Pump, pump, pump, get it, get it
Shake, shake, shake, shake a lil' somethin'
That's the way, yeah
That's the way, you go girl

Pump, pump, pump, get it, get it
Shake, shake, shake, shake a lil' somethin'
That's the way, yeah
That's the way, you go girl

Bitch, I wanna see you shake it
Bend on over, butt-ass naked
Now pump, pump, pump, get it get it
I got 135 beats a minute

It's your brother, Marquis, callin' all the freaks
To show the pink and the booty-cheeks
Stick from the bottom, stick from the top
Show me a shot, lemme see what you got

Rub that ass and play with that clit
I'm still with that freaky shit
One time for the girls in Georgia
Detroit, Michigan and Miami, Florida

That's how we make our music fast
'Cause the girls down south like to shake that ass
They so fine, I can't take it
They gots to freak it, they gots to shake it

Pump, pump, pump, get it, get it
Shake, shake, shake, shake a lil' somethin'
