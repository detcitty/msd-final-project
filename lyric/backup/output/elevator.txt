Hey girl
You're coming with me
Coming with me

Hey girl
You're coming to me
Coming to me

Hey girl
You're coming with me
Coming with me

Hey girl
You're coming to me
Come on

Talk to me, girl
Let me tell you
Got you stuck
On my elevator
Get up
On my el-el-el-el-el

Hey, my first floor stuck
Wanna golddigga woman
Money cash flow all big faced honies
Fighting on the floor, got them b-boys running
Shorty got both broke can't see what's coming

With them apple bottoms, with them apple bottoms honey
Dolce and Gabbana and she get up on my money
Louis that bitch when she vindy in the money
See them karats on the bitch, now she pimp bugs bunny

Used to date Kanye, now she want me
While I got the juice wanna take my OJ
It ain't her birthday but her name on a cake
If I ever play for ookie grade A
