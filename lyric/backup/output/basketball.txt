Chours:
They're playing Basketball
We love that Basketball
They're playing Basketball
We love that Basketball

(Now rapping Basketball Number 1 Kurtis Blow)
Basketball is my favorite sport
I like the way they dribble up and down the court
Just like I'm the King on the microphone so is Dr. J and Moses Malone
I like Slam dunks take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley oop
