Oh except my guitar, baby
And some bump music
(A-okay, I don'play)
Oh unless you're playin' checkers, baby
And some bump music
(A-okay, I don't play)
Oh baby, let me teach you
And some bump music

If you're a freak for a beat
It drives you messin' into your seat
Oh turn me on, baby
I'm the show, you're the show

When we get through
You're gonna holler for more
Bump, bump, bump, bump, baby
Bump, bump, bump
You get up, we get down
Bouncing on the (?)
We'll bounce on, baby, it's all right

Drummer keep the thumpin'
The bass, an keep the booties bumpin'
Doin' it to a rhythmic kind of time
Drummer keep the thumpin'
The bass, an keep the booties bumpin'
