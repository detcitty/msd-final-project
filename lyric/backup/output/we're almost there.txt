No matter how hard
The task may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams

No broken bridges
Can turn us around
Cause what we're searchin' for
Will soon be found

Refrain
Cause we're almost there
Just one more step
(Cause we're almost there)
Just one more step
(Just one more step)
Don't give up
'Cause we're almost all almost there
('Cause we're almost there)

(Look at the lovers)
Look at the lonely lovers
That didn't make it
Life's long hard climb
(Life's long hard climb)
They just couldn't take it
(They just couldn't take it)

Don't let it happen to me and you
