Lately there seems to be some insecurities
About the way I feel where I wanna be
Boy you know it's with you
No one can do the things you do to me

Never to be mistaking long as it's love we're making
There'll be no hesitating you and me
And it always will be and I wont leave your side
'Cause you know

Love will be right here, be right here
Right here, be right here
No fear, have no fear
No tears love is here

True love some don't believe in
That's just what I'm giving
I'm gonna keep it strong I'll be holding on to you
No one can do me like you do it's true
