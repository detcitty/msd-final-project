V-Town, brother, check it out, I'm 'bout to throw down
Dick in hand, the shit that had you toked down
A little city, chillin' in the North Bay
Needless to say, my boyz don't play, fool
Yorker sidin', you know how the songs goes
In the back, sippin' purple chongos
Don't look for trouble, but it always seems to find us
Forty-grippin', panties, sippin', and these finks are right behind us
Quick left, one blow, K.O.
Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellas
Oh, what the hell, I guess I better tell ya
It's Friday night, I got a brand new kit on
A fifth of Hen, for me to get bent on
Hit the country club to pick up ML
