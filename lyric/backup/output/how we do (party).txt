And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit...
And party, and party

I stumbled up to the window
Opened the curtains to blinding light
Make up all over the pillow
What went on? What went on?
What went on last night?
You look so sweet while you're dreaming
Holding your bottle of Tanqueray
It isn't even the weekend
Baby that's, how I know, you're the one for me

I wanna party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit...
And party, and party

'Cause when the sun sets baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah when I'm with you
So put your arms around me baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do

We got that sweet hot loving
