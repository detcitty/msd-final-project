He spends his nights in California
Watching the stars on the big screen
And then he lies awake and he wonders
Why can't that be me?

'Cause in his life he is filled
With all these good intentions
He´s left a lot of things
He´d rather not mention right now
Just before he says goodnight
He looks up with a little smile at me
And he says

"If I could be like that
Well I would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes"
If I could be like that
What would I do?
