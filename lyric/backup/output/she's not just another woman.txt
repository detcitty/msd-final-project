She's not just another woman
She's not no, no
She's not just another woman
She's not no, no
She's given me a new born birth
I found sweetness on this bitter earth
She knows the things to say
To help my troubles away
And when the words she say won't do
She'll try a kiss or two
And if her kisses fail to move me
She'll take a little time to soothe me
She's mine, mine, mine
