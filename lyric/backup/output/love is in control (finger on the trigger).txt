(I've) hung around with big shots
never knew love was in the sights
I guess I missed the target
caught up in a different line of fire

But I know since I've been aiming
for the sweetness in your soul
your name is on the bullet
and it's gettin' ready to explode
there's been a change inside my life
and I just wanna let you know

I've got my finger on the trigger
love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go

Bass Line:
Baby, let's have some fun
