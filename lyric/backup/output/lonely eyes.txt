Across the crowded room
See her sitting all alone
Looking like an angel
With no place to call home

Stiking up a conversation
They begin by trading names
She begins to smile
And they begin to play the game

She's heard every line
They're a dozen for a dime
But tonight she's gonna listen
One more time

Lonely eyes say she's willing
Lonely eyes show her feelings
She's seen too many nights
