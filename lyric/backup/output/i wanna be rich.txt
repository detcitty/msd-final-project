Imagine
Cash cold, that's what I need

The bill collectors, they ring my phone
They bother me when I'm not at home
Ain't go no time to be fooling round
Feet hit the floor and I can't slow down, you see

I want money, lots and lots of money
I want the pie in the sky
I want money, lots and lots of money
So don't be asking me why

I wanna be rich, ohh
I wanna be rich, ohh
I wanna be rich, ohh
