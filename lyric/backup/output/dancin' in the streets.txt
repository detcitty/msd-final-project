With KC

Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street

They're dancing in Chicago
(Dancing in the street)
Down in New Orleans
(Dancing in the street)
In New York City
(Dancing in the street)

All we need is music
(Sweet, sweet) sweet
(Sweet, sweet) music
They'll be music (music)
Everywhere (everywhere)

They'll be swinging
Swaying and records playing
