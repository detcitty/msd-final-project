Well, East coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls, with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there

The Mid-West farmers' daughters
Really make you feel alright
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night
