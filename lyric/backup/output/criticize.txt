Ooh-ooh
(You don't realise)
(I just want what is right)
(Still the same)

(Criticise)

can't you find something not to talk about

Is this only when you sing

Makes you look better when you put things down
Value your opinion
Don't criticise my friends
Criticise my ideas
Don't crticise my lifestyle
I'm fed up cos all you wanna do is criticise

(Don't just close your mind)
Ooh-ooh
(You don't realise)
