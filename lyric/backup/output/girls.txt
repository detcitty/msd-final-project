Well, I've seen so many things
I've been all over the world
Well, I've had ups and downs
I've been over for a while
I thought I knew everything
Between the bad and the good
Guess I was wrong because
I misunderstood about
Girls, girls

Well, when I was young
My daddy sat down with me
He said a good life is hard
If you don't know what you need
Well, I guess he was right
Because the way that's it been
There's still one thing
I just can't understand and that's

Girls
They want you to tell
Them you love them
Girls
They're soft and
They're warm when you hug them
Girls
