Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again

Well I'm out to have a real good time
And now you want try to fling me
But friends of yours are friends of mine
Do don't be tryin to pling me
You don't have nothing good to say
The words will be witholding
The kinds of games a girl will play
Just like mother told me, so

CHORUS
Here we go
Going through the same thing
Here we go again
