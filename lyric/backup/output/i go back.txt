Jack and Diane painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song

An' I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levy
Livin' life with no sense of time
An' I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks

Every time I hear that song
I go back, I go back

I used to rock all night long to, "Keep On Rockin' Me Baby"
