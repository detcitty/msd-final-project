No One Else
(Featuring Da Brat)

There you are, looking at me,
Tell me what you want this to be.
It could be everything that your heart desires,
All you got to do is stick around for awhile.
There's so many things that I wanna do,
Take you all around, it's all up to you.
If you take my hand and just follow me,
There's no telling what we could be,
Just you and me.
