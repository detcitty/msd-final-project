Out of the blue, out of the night
You came along and you changed my life
I'm feeling things I swear I've never felt before, yes I am, baby
You looked at me; that's all it took
You read my heart like an open book

And it was true love right from the start
It was true love straight from my heart
It was true love, ain't no doubt about it, baby
True love, I can't live without it

Before I met you baby, I was alone
