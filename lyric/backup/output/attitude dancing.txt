(Carly Simon/Jacob Brackman)

There's a new kind of dancing
that's gonna be the rage
You just leave yourself behind
Like an actor on a stage

Cop a different pose
>From the pose you're in
Shine a different attitude
>From underneath your skin

Attitude dancing
Strut around the floor in a different attitide
Attitude dancing
Any attitude is the proper attitude
