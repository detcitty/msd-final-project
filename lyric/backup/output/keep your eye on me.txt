Am I real? Do the words I speak before you make you feel
That the love I've lay for you will see no ending?
Well if you look into my eyes then you should know
That there's nothing here to doubt nothing to fear
And you can lay your questions down 'cause if you'll hold me
we can fade into the night and you'll know
