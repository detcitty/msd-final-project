Hey Deb
Uh huh
Thank you for being woman enough to come
Whitney, what's this about?

I know he's leaving me for you
Who said that, who told you that is true?
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?

He told me that he loved me
I heard that
He told me I was beautiful
How did you know? How did you know?
'Cause I've played that scene before

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life

Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast
