Don't even like to think about it
I don't know what I'd do without it
I wouldn't know I live and not be for your love

Baby you came to me, in my time of need
When I needed you, you were there for me
Baby the love from you, is what got me through
It's because of you, I was able to
Give my heart again, you gave me

Someone to love, someone to touch
Someone to hold, someone to know
Someone to love, someone to trust
Someone to hold, oh, someone to know

I thought I'd never love again
I thought my life was over and
