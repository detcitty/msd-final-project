When dreaming, I'm guided to another world, time and time again
At sunrise, I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake
So let's go there, let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask "can we stay?"

Can you take me higher
