[Verse One]
Ah shit y'all done fucked up and let me in this bitch
I'm just your average hood nigga with dreams of gettin' rich (But
you don't hear me)
My crib big like a football field (football field)
You might fuck around and think I signed a football deal (But you
don't hear me)
I take 15 minutes to drop a track (yeah)
