No, come on, I said no
No means no now
I said no

[CHORUS]
I talk to myself
'Cause there is no one to talk to
People ask me why
Why I do what I do
I talk to myself
'Cause there is no one to talk to
People ask me why
Why I do what I do

People ask me why
I feel this way
Always alone
Day after day

Well, I used to be sweet
And I used to be kind
