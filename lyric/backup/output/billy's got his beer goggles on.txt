Billy's at the bar, he's been there all night
First ten beers, he's had since her goodbye
Hey, hey, she left him broke in his new truck

He don't smoke but he lights one up
Temporary fix for his heartache
He's hurting bad but he's feeling great

He's on the dance floor yellin' free bird
Singin' off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him a girl and he holds on tight
