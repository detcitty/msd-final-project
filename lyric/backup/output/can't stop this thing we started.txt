Yeah!
Baby!
I'm comin' to get ya
You might stop a hurricane
Might even stop the drivin' rain
You might have a dozen other guys

But if you wanna stop me baby don't even try
I'm goin' one way
your way
It's such a strong way
let's make it our way
Now baby,

I can't stop this thing we started

You gotta know it's right
I can't stop this course we've plotted
Yeah!
This thing called love we got it
