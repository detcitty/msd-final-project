I just wanna be everything
That you'd like so that we'd never part
'Cause you're the kind of girl that brings out
All the joy and happiness in my heat

You're a dream come true, my heart's delight
You make me wanna tell the world
'Cause you're the spark that lights up my life
So I just wanna let you know, I gotta let you know
Just wanna let you know

Anyway you want me baby
That's how you gonna get me
