Oh, I know that it's getting late
But I don't wanna go home
I'm in no hurry baby, time can wait
Cause I don't wanna go home

Listen to the man sing his song
But I dont wanna home
I dont mind if it take all night long
Cause I dont wanna go home

Listen, baby I know we had to try
To reach up and touch the sky baby
Whatever happened to you and I
That I dont wanna go home?

Lord, look at how the people stare
