Every time I turn the conversation
to something deeper
than the weather
I can feel you
all but shuttin'down.
And when I need an explanation
for the silence

You just tell me
you don't wanna
talk about it now.

What you're not sayin' is comin' in loud and clear
We're at a crossroads here...

If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
