Rain on my Sunday shoes
Pick up the daily news
Looks like tomorrows blues
But its better than none

Call on the telephone
knowin' that he's not home
I'll put on the Rollin' Stones
And I can have me some fun

Start up a flight of stairs
Stand up and comb your hair
Try not to change things
More than you can withstand

Get into something new
