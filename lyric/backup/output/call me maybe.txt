I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
and now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
but now you're in my way
Your stare was holdin', Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you
and this is crazy
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
It's hard to look right
at you baby
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
Hey, I just met you
and this is crazy
but here's my number
so call me, maybe?
