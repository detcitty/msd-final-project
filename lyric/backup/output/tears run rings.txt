On heavenly rain
You fell into my life
Unforgettable smile
Unforgettable lies

In the name of the cross
Or a banner of love
With the hand of a friend
Or under a blanket of trust

The angels sighed
A little girl cried
The tears run rings
Around my eyes

We're going to set fire
To the house in my heart
We're going to set fire
To the whole damn world

I don't understand
The wicked things we do
In the name of the good
In the name of the few

The angels sighed
The little girl cried
The tears run rings
Around my eyes
