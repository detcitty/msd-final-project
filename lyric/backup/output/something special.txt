I found a way to be everything I dreamed of
And I don't know what's in me that I will become who I wanna be
And I finally found it
And I'm taking the long way out
'Cause it's gonna be
Somethin' special to me
Somethin' special to me
Yeah, Yeah

Days go by (Days go by)
And I'll grow stronger (I'll still try)
It takes time but I'll never let go (Never let go)
Days go by (Days go by)
And I'll try harder (I'll still try)
To make it mine (Because I know)
It's somethin' special to me
