Better take a good look before I disappear
Because I'm just about to be your used-to-be
You might catch a glimpse of my tail lights in the dust
And if you notice somethin' missin' well it's me

'Cause I tried a new life,
I cried and you stood by
Well here's a little magic thing I do...

Chorus:
Now you see me, now you don't
