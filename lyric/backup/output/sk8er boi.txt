He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?

He wanted her
She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a skater boy
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

Five years from now
She sits at home
Feeding the baby she's all alone
