Hey, there's more to me than meets the eye

He wants my body
He wants my body
He wants my body
He wants my body
He wants my body
He wants my body

No... no... 

Ooh... ooh... ooh... 

I was lookin' for much more than just another one night stand
Hopin' to connect a little deeper
In a crowded room of cheap perfume, my eyes received his glance
Captured by the presence of this creature

Then we started to dance, I thought it was my chance
To display my inner message through the rhythm
I was mesmerized and tantalized, he told me with a smile
"Come on over, get into my system"

Then we talk and then he's into love
No more conversation, give it up, ow
