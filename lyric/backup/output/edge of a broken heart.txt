I can't believe I could've been so blind, but love is strange
I thought about it for a long long time, but the truth remains
I don't need another lonely night to dry my tears
The answer's plain as black and white, and I can see the picture very clear

I been living on the edge of a broken heart
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl
