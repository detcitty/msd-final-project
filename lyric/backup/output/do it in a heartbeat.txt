(Carlene Carter - Nick Lowe - John McFee) 

If there was something I could do
To capture you
I'd do it in a heartbeat
Some little trick that I could try
To catch your eye
I'd do it in a heartbeat
If I had to jump through a hoop of fire
Even that would be as easy as pie
If to fly like a Superman
Would win your hand
