Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8... (yeah)
Countin' them bands all way to the top, 'til they be fallin' over
Countin' them bands, on the way to the top, 'til we fallin' over

I don't really care if you cry
On the real you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said "Baby, I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Phantom that's all red
Inside all white
Like something you ride a sled down
