(Somebody...)
Told her that there was a place like heaven
Across the water on a 747
Yeah, we're living in,
In a modern world.

And pretty soon, she's really got the notion
Of flying out across the big blue ocean
Yeah, we're living in,
In a modern world.

Talk is cheap on satellite
But all I get is (static!)
Information, I'm still here
Re-dial on automatic.
