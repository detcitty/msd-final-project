South suicide Queens... all niggaz
gather up all your arms
and get ready for this new world order
shit is about to change-muther fucker

Verse 1:

I'm America's nightmare
young black and just dont give a fuck
I just want to get high and live it up
so fuck in '95
and why you tryin to slave us
with minimum wages
slammin my niggas up in cages
changing their behaivors
and spittin razors thats outraegeous
smoking moaches is hopeless
we want lazy sofas and sculptures
lady chauffers who fuck us
full house and royal flushes
roll with the rush
its the official nas
got bitches with pistols and cash
we living in the last
my theory is "fuck it"
sexy niggas get obducted
my corrupted
is conducted
through ghettos
sippin amaretto
hand on the metal
foot on the pedal
never settle
we wear Carolina Herrera
dirty Donna Karan sweaters
wrap over leathers and seudes
gold plated guns and grenades
to blow up
I got news from the informers
I'm trapped in corners
bustin shots at Time-Warner
