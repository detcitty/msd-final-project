Been preparin', 
All week long, 
To get it ready, 
To get it on.

The only thing, 
That's on my mind, 
Is drivin' it home, 
In 4-4 time.

1, 2, 3, 4... 

[Chorus:]
You gotta get it up, 
Get down, 
Get it on, 
Or get on out.

That's the only way, 
To make my baby shout.

You gotta get it up, 
Get down, 
Get it on,
