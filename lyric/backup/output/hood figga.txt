All the hoes jockin, beat steady knockin
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin
Nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin
Bet she cant do it on a dick, she poppin
We bottle poppin, you cock blockin
Told ya gurl you rap, but ya cd floppin
You say you gettin money man, we aint seen nothin
Ya gurl is persistant, she aint stoppin

(hook)
Man she say she want a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin, yall know we run the town
Hood nigga
And i keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
Hood nigga
And my chevy sittin on 24's
Flats look like flapjack, pancake you aint know
Hood nigga
Im a play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But im a keep it hood folk

(verse 2)
And i dont need a scale for the work
I can eyeball purp, i am not you jerk
