Fallen on hard times, but it feels good to know
That milk and honey's just around the bend
Running on bad lines we'd better run as we go
Tear up, tear up the overdraft again

Oh, dear Prime Minister, it's all such a mess
Go right ahead and pull the rotten tooth
Oh, Mr. President, you've been put to the test
