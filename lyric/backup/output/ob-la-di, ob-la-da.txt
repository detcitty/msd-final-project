Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, brah
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, brah
La-la, how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (rin-ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (sing)

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da (la-la-la-la la-la-)
Life goes on, brah (la-la la-la-la-laaa)
