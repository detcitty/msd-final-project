This is Headliner from Arrested Development, and I come here tonight
To give thanks to ithe rain, so brothers and sisters please put down your
Umbrellas, you won't be needing those today
Look to the clouds with the most rain coming from it, for without the
Rain there's no me and there's no you
I said a drip-drop, a drip-drop, drip-drop
Viva bum bum bum drip-drop
Let it rain, let it rain, let God's water feed me
The water of life, mentally rinsing me, physically drenching me
Most are frowning upon your arrival
But I need you for survival
And when you fall on my community
I run outside to properly
Greet you
Let it rain, take my pain, I'm glad to meet you
Fill my eyes with a colorful rainbow
Every drop hits me, fills me
With an unmeasurable amount of security
Knowing my God acknowledges me
As if each drop of rain is aimed toward me
My Lord Thanks for lifeThanks for my rain
