Another sad day in my life
Nothing is the same
since you`ve been gone
This old house
is not the same anymore
I`m sitting
and writing a letter to you
Knowing that you will
Probably never receive it
But I miss you
I walk by myself
I talk to myself
I sleep by myself
Ooh baby, I miss you

Dirty dishes in the sink, mmm hmm
Lots of time for me to think
Didn`t think,
didn`t think I knew the tear
It`s been a week,
But oh, it seems like a year
