I'm comin' up so you better get this party started

Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waitin' for me to arrive
Sendin' out the message to all of my friends

I got lots a style, got my
I can go for miles if you know what I mean

I'm comin' up so you better get this party started
I'm comin' up so you better get this party started

Pumpin' up the volume, breakin' down to the beat
