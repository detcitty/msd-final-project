I don't need nobody
Shaking my tree
Save all your love
Save it just for me

You kiss me but the feeling just ain't there
No, no you're saving the real thing for Jody
And you're using me just for a spare
I can see through that

You come running, running
Running, running, running to me
Each time Jody makes you cry
Lord, have mercy

You're nothing but a fool for Jody
But I'm a bigger fool to watch the
Tears as they fall from your eyes
All right, now

I'm gonna tell you something
I'm tired of standing in for Jody
