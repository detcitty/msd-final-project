You got me rollin' like a wheel on the road
Turnin' round and round, nowhere to go
I've got to find out if you're feeling it too
It's hard to tell, so here's what I do
And every time I want more
I'll take you out on the floor

I was made for dancin'
All, all, all, all night long
I was made for dancin'
