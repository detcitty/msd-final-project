(Ryan) Hey batter batter hey batter batter swing
(Chad) I've go to just do my thing

(Ryan) Hey batter batter hey batter batter swing
I'll show you that it's one and the same

Baseball, dancing, same game
It's easy
Step up to the plate, start swingin
(Chad) I wanna play ball now, and that's all
This is what I do
It ain't no dance that you can show me

(Girls) You'll never know if you never try
(Chad) There's just one little thing that stops me ev'ry time
(Ryan) Come on
(Chad) I don't dance

(Ryan and Girls) I know you can
(Chad) Not a chance

(Ryan and Girls) If I could do this, well, you could do that
(Chad) But I don't dance

(Ryan) Hit it out of the park
(Chad) I don't dance

(Ryan) I say you can
(Chad) There's not a chance

(Ryan) Slide home, you score, swingin on the dance floor
(Chad) I don't dance no
