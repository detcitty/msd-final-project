I'd love to know just what you're thinkin'
Every little river, runnin' through your mind
You give and you take
You come and you go
You leave me here wonderin' if I'll ever know
How much you care or how much you don't
Whatever you need, whatever you want

If you're gonna be somebody's heartbreak
If you're gonna be somebody's mistake
If you're gonna be somebody's first time
Somebody's last time, baby be mine
If you're lookin' to be somebody's 'just friends'
A little laughin', little lovin', never callin' again, that's just fine
