The Declaration of Independence
Think I could tell you that first sentence but then I? m lost
I can't begin to count the theories
I've had pounded in my head that I forgot

I don't remember all that Spanish
Or The Gettysburg Address
But there is one speech from high school
I'll never forget

Come on in boy, sit on down
And tell me about yourself
So you like my daughter, do you now?
Yeah, we think she's something else

She's her daddy's girl
Her momma's world
She deserves respect
That? s what she'll get, ain? t it son?
