They're tearing down the street
Where I grew up
Like pouring brandy
In a Dixie cup

They're paving concrete
On a part of me
No crime for killing off
A memory

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Can you find the Milky Way
Long Tall Sally and Tin Pan Alley
Have seen their dying day

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It'll never be the same
But we're all forgiven
We're only living
To leave the way we came
