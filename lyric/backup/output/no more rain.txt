No more rain in this cloud
No more rain in this cloud

My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
(There's no more rain)

My sunshine has come
(No more rain in this cloud)
(Let it go)
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
 (No more rain)

There's no hiding place
When someone has hurt you
It's written on your face and it reads
"Broken spirit, lost and confused
Empty, scared, used and abused, a fool, oh"

Ain't it funny that the way you feel
Shows on your face?
 (It's written all over your face, yeah)
And the smile you used to wear
Seems a little bit out of place
 (Tracks of your tears)
People, oh, hold on, in time
It gets a little better, oh yeah

My sunshine has come
 (No more rain in this cloud)
(My sunshine)
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
 (There's no more rain, no, no)

My sunshine has come
And I'm all cried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud
 (No more rain, no more rain)

So you want to live
And to you I shall give
All the space that you requested
