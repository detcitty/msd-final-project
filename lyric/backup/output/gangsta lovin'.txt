I just wanna rock you
All night long, ohh
I wanna rock you
I just wanna rock you
All night long, ohh

Yo, need you to understand me Daddy
I ain't ya average baby girl
Doin' it dawg, I'm well established
I ain't tryin to lead ya on
Just wanna ask if ya might wanna
Gimme ya name, explain your status
Ya know I see ya time to time
You seem available
Don't mean shit
I know these bitches wanna settle you
Gotta say you on my short list, a few
Them other dudes is OK
But I'm feelin' you
Want ya in the best way
So whatchu gone do about it
Why don't you just test me
You won't wanna do without it
No I'm comin' at you hard
Meetin' a thug
And I ain't givin' up
Till I get that gangsta love

I just wanna rock you
All night long, ohh
I wanna rock you
I just wanna rock you
All night long, ohh
