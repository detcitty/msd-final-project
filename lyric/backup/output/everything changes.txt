Well You came in my life like a ray of light
Shining through the clouds in my heart
I just looked at You and the world was new
It was right, right from the start

You came to me with a love so sweet
And I'll never, never ever be the same

Everything changes
Nothing looks the same through the eyes of love
Everything changes
When you love some, love some, love someone
Everything changes

Thought there never would be anyone for me
Then You came and changed everything
