Ridin' restless under broken sky
Weary traveler, somethin' missin' inside
Always lookin' for a reason to turn around
Desperate for a little peace of mind
Just a little piece of what I left behind
Well, I found it now, you're like comin' home

You're like a Sunday mornin', pleasin' my eyes
You're a midsummer's dream under a star-soaked sky
That peaceful easy feelin' at the end of a long, long road
