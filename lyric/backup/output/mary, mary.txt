Mary, Mary...Why ya buggin?
Mary, Mary...I need ya huggin

Had a fly girl Flo, called her honey
Next thing she spent up all my money
?? debt, you and your girl's dizzy
Stopped movin crack but you're still gettin pissy
You could call me everyday God sent
like you was Lois Lane and I was Clark Kent
I spend and I spend and you spent and you spent
Now my house with a mouse is a roach with a tent

Mary, Mary...Why ya buggin?
Mary, Mary...I need ya huggin
