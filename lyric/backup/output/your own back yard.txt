I've been sitting here, thinking
About when I started in drinking
I went on to dope
It surely did change my life

I cried a tear in a beer for me
I lost everything near and dear to me
Mainly my children and my wife

My idea of having a good time
Was sitting with my head
Between my knees

I knew everything there was to know
Everything except which way to go
I cried, oh, God, take me
Will you, please

Many a time
I swore up and down
I didn't need any of this junk
That was going round

I can quit
