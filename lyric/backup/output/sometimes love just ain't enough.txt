Now I don't wanna lose you
But I don't wanna use you
Just to have somebody by my side

And I don't wanna hate you
I don't wanna take you
But I don't wanna be the one to cry

And that don't really matter to anyone, anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door
