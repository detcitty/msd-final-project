I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows
We'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will i do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still i cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'cause i'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

(who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(who is it?)
Is it my brother!
(who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
