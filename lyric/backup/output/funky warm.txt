You're a little late
So step right this way
And we'll get started
Granny, what? Say it now

Oh, say it now, say it now, ahem
Me and the Ohio Players
Are gonna tell you about a worm
He's the funkiest worm in the world

Alright, sing it, Clarence
Clarence, theres' a worm in the ground
Yes, there is, Granny, that's right
