This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
I went from being broke to sleeping in Versace shirts
This is my story - money, cars, bad hoes
This is my story-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
And I'm, stickin', to it
And I'm, stickin', to it
And I'm, stickin', to it
And I'm, stickin', to it
And I'm, stickin', to it
And I'm, stickin', to it
And I'm, stickin', to it
And I'm, stickin', to it

Came from humble beginnings now I'm cocky with my spending
They say "life is just a game" and I thank God that I'm winning
Models roll my indo, I beat the pussy, Django
Them niggas talking money, I got more digits in my gate code
She make a pole disappear like hocus pocus
You're ain't never gon' find another nigga this focused
I got every block, every street corners sold up
Whatever club represent my city, throw it up
I own the game, coach last player shown up
Okay, haters throw fitted never showed up

This is my story, yeah, I'm from that Chi-town dirt
