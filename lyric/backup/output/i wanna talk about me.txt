Yeah, yeah...
That's right...
We talk about your work
How your boss is a jerk
We talk about your church
And your head when it hurts
We talk about the troubles you been having with your brother
about your daddy and your mother
and your crazy ex-lover

We talk about your friends
and the places that you've been
We talk about your skin and the devils on your chin
The polish on your toes and the run in your hose
And God knows we're gonna talk about your clothes

You know talking about you makes me smile
but every once in a while

I wanna talk about me,
wanna talk about I,
wanna talk about number one,
oh my me my
what I think,
what I like,
