Let's get it
Burrr

No, I ain't tryna flex, no ceilings you can see who's in it
If we're talking about sex, girl, you know that I invented that
And I'm onto the next, that's unless you bring a friend who with it

Oh, I'm sorry, oh, you mad that I came to the party?
Like, no no no
You took your girl to the club and now she gone, gone, gone
Now she asking me when I'm taking her home, home, home
I tell her "let's go" long as you know
