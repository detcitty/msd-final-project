It was this bitch that I knew back from '86
Graduated and made it from the college of dicks
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me
Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key

Nah, hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckas go
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well
How the hell you been since I had no job
Hum, why don't you give me some

'Cause you know I flow and run for Suave
Nah, all of that was on the couch
No doubt y'all records spin, y'all shippin' in gold
It's cold on the outside lookin in

You'd besta make yourself worthy
'Cause I got a click of niggaz ready to get their Johnson very dirty
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit
Ain't this a bitch

I remember when you would not give me shit
Now you down for them habits
Put your numbers on them naturals
Make it snappy 'cause I got to go to the bathroom

Hoes with no clothes sho nuff
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothes sho nuff
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?
