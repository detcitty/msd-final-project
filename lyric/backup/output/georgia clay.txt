Ain't it funny how some things take you back
And the here and now just fades to black?
When I pull that blue tarp off of that time machine
Man, it hits me

Seventeen years old, runnin' on dumb luck
Spent the whole damn summer livin' in that truck
Them old tires still covered in all that mud
Like it sticks with me in my blood
