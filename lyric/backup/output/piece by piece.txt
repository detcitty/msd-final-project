(Snow/Tubes/Rundgren)

She looks good
But she's not altogether right
All her parts are not screwed on tight
There's a touch of tragedy

When she moves
you can see the secret showing through
She'd deny it if she thought I knew
But she could never lie to me

Anyone would think there's nothing wrong,
she looks so satisfied
