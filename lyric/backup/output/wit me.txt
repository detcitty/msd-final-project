Bitch! Put my dick on yo face, put my gun in yo purse
Put my work in yo pussy, bitch don’t cum on the work
Pass the weed to your slime, these niggas greener than lime
So many knots in my pockets, the bitch need a massage
I was born in the drought, I hope I die in yo mouth
If you're a rat you should’ve died as a mouse
The weed louder than the opera house, til the fat lady sings
Drop codeine in my punch, I’m bout to take a swing
If niggas thinkin I’m soft, I’ll knock yo thinkin cap off
I get blood out these pussies, I’m a stinky tampon
This for my niggas back home, I’m so New Orleans regardless
Got bitches fallin like August could sell bullshit to a tourist
My bitch is badder than me, call that Adam & Eve
I do tricks on my skateboard, not up my sleeve
I kiss yo bitch on the neck, shoot your man in the head
Hit his mama address then send his parents his head
I play with pussy, not these niggas
Crucify these niggas
Kidnap em, call they boss, and ask 'em who gone buy these niggas
Got Lil Wayne on her ass, Lil Tunechi on her titties
To kill me you gotta die wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me
(wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)

We ain’t playin, got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
In the van got 100 gat (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
Streets (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
She's (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
He’s (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
(I’m wit you!)
We ain’t playin, got 100 racks (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
In the van got 100 gat (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
Strong (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
Gas (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)
Drank (wit me, wit me, wit me, wit me)

I ain’t never been dumb my nigga
Or a sucka neither, go ahead play around wit it
Cash on deck, they be layin round wit it
Got a K - fuck with us,, I’ll be sprayin' rounds with it.
I’m cold! Don't believe me, just ask yo bitch I swear she know her legs up high
