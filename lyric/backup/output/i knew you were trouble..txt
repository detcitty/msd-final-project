Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e

I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e-ee

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
