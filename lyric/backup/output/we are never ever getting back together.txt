I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)

Then you come around again and say, "Baby
I miss you, and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you" We break up, you call me, "I love you"

Ooh, we called it off again last night, but ooh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
