take a straight and stronger course to the corner of your life.
make the white queen run so fast she hasn't got time to make you a wife.

move me on to any black square,
use me any time you want,
just remember that the goal
'sfor us to capture all we want, anywhere,
yea, yea, yea.
don't surround yourself with yourself,
