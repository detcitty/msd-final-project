I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do

I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone

You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
