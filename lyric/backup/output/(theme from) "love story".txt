I am searching for the one I can't see anymore
I am listening for the one I can't hear anymore
I can see the tings I couldn't see
Can hear the things I couldn't hear
You've given me this power
Ever since you left me right here
Before I was selfish and I didn't care about you yeah
I didn't understand your heart I was a fool
Right now I'm trying to change who I am
And I know you're not by my side
But it's because of your love
