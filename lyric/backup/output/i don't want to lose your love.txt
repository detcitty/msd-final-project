Oh, I don't wanna lose you love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
(Take a deep breath)
Ohh... (B Angie B)
(B Angie B)
Dinner's ready
And the wine is chilled
My baby's coming over
Oh, you know just how I feel
Because I don't
Wanna lose your love
Think how it feels, baby
It's getting harder to conceal, yeah
Do I fit in the life that
You're living, boy (baby, say I do)
Do you feel all the love
I've been giving you
Oh, when I come home
Do you care to see me
Things ain't the way
They used to be, baby
I don't think you
Really wanna leave me
You've got to say
Just what's the reason
Don't take my love
For granted, boy
And then turn around
And do me, whoa
I don't wanna lose your love
(I don't wanna)
I don't wanna lose your love (ooh)
Don't wanna lose your love
