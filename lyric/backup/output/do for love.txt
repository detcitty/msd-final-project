Turn it up loud, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up

I shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start
Taught me so many lessons how not to mess with broken hearts
So many questions, when this began we was the perfect match
Perhaps we had some problems but we workin' at it

And now the arguments are gettin' loud
I wanna stay but I can't help from walkin' out
Just throw it away, just take my hand and understand
If you could see, I never planned to be a man, it just wasn't me

But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions

Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
