Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy (Whoa, whoa)
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Money's tight, he's workin' every night
It ain't easy to keep the flame alive
And when he finally comes home to ya
He's just too tired to do the things you want to

You can't help but wonder to yourself
How would it be with someone else
Just keep in mind, every storm ends in time
Love is forever, stay together

(Stay together) When you got something real
(Love forever) That you may never feel again
