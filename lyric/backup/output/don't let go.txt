Hear that whistle, it's ten o'clock
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Come on, baby, it's time to rock
(Don't let go, don't let go)

I'm so happy I got you here
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Keeps me grinning from ear to ear
(Don't let go, don't let go)

[CHORUS]
Ooh wee, this feeling's killing me
Aw shucks, well, I wouldn't
Stop for a million bucks
I love you so, just hold
Me tight and don't let go
