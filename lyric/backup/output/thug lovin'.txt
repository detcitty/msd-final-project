What up, Gotti, yeah

This is how it's goin' down
(All we need is a a stage, God
Ha-ha, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, come on, ha-ha-ha)
It's on and poppin', baby (It's on and poppin')
The Last Temptation, ha-ha
He's back
Y'all know who I'm talkin' ‘bout
To the world over, B. Brown
Come on, come on
I know you're gettin' bored

Dealin' with him
I know you miss my lovin', my thuggin'
Thug lovin'
And I know you're gettin' bored

Dealin' with him
I know you miss my lovin', my thuggin'
Thug lovin'
And I know you're gettin' bored

I know you're livin' your life faithfully, safely

away from me
But you miss bein' next to me, don't you
Don't let her love haunt you, lust for what you wanted
Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to
interfere or intervene on me
Peelin' your wide body out of them tight jeans
Wrist on freeze, see it's on me
Shoes 19, comin' through in that new Bentley thing
Talk of the town, tease of the city...
You and I make headlines like Lo and Diddy and Bob and
Whitney
It appears the Lord sent me a pound?
Real devilish and freak that
Forget the story, I know you're gettin' bored
And you ain't gettin' horny no more, is he
‘Cause when it's all said and done, it's me
