Girl you take my breath away

And when I'm with someone new
I'd rather be here with you
Baby, forever
My heart belongs to you
'cause I think about you all the time
I know my love is true
when we're together
I've played around girl and I made you cry

When I looked up, you were saying good-bye
I'm begging you please
I need you so bad
Don't leave me now, you're the best that I've had
