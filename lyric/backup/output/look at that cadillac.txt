Well, wake up in the morning, brush my teeth and comb my hair
Well, I wake up in the morning, I brush my teeth and comb my hair
There's a big black cadillac parked on the street over there

Well it's the finest lookin' car, that ever rolled of the line
Any other car would just be wasting your time
Ooh one fine day I'm gonna make a cadillac mine

I gotta get a cadillac
Look at that cadillac, look at that
