We left for Frisco in your Rambler
The radiator running dry
I've never been much of a gambler
And had a preference to fly

You said, "Forget about the airline
Let's take the car and save the fare"
We blew a gasket on the Grapevine
And eighty dollars on repairs

All aboard
(Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Hot summer night in Sausalito
Can't stand the heat another mile
Let's drop a quarter in the meter
