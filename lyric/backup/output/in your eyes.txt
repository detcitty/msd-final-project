Love
I get so lost sometimes

Days pass
And this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away
I drive off in my car

But whichever way I go
I come back to the place you are
All my instincts
They return

The grand fa√ßade
So soon will burn
Without a noise

Without my pride
I reach out from the inside
In your eyes
