I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good

Flash, we meet
Passin' in the streets
Words unspoken
Silence unbroken, hey

Just by chance
We fell into romance
The cry of success
Left no room to guess

Oh, no (Oh, no)
Love has knocked us down and scored
We've been twice around the block before
Know the changes you've been through
My promise is to you

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Better than before
You know I'll love you more
