s that India.Arie? What happened to her hair? Ha ha ha ha ha
Dat dad a dat da Dad a ooh

Little girl with the press and curl
Age eight I got a Jheri curl
Thirteen I got a relaxer
I was a source of so much laughter
At fifteen when it all broke off
Eighteen and went all natural
February two thousand and two
I went and did
What I had to do
Because it was time to change my life
To become the women that I am inside
Ninety-seven dreadlock all gone
I looked in the mirror
For the first time and saw that HEY...

I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations no no
I am not my hair
