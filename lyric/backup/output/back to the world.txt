I know you're thinking
I've been better off without you by my side
But baby, this season
I don't want another cold rainy July

You would think that I'd be better now
But I'm not 'cause I don't have you, yeah
You would think that I'd be better now
But I'm not 'cause I don't have you, yeah

Come back to the world, come back to the world
Baby, back to my world
Come back to the world, come back to the world
Baby, back to my world, yeah
