Don't need no money
Just call my name
And I'll be there honey
And I'll ease the pain
If you had a million I wouldn't take it it's simple

Can't you see cause you're worth than that
You can get it in a time girl
So came and get it from me
My love is my love is my love is
Free free free free
What a feel love is
