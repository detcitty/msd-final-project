Woo woo

Come on, ride the train, hey, ride it, woo woo
Come on, ride the train, hey, ride it, woo woo
Come on, ride the train, woo woo, hey
Ride it, woo woo

Come on, ride the train
Woo woo, hey, ride it, woo woo
Come on, ride the train
It's the Choo Choo, ride it, woo woo

Come on, ride the train, it's the Choo Choo train
Come on, ride the train, it's the Choo Choo
Ride it, woo woo
Come on, ride the train, it's the Choo Choo train

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I think I can, I think I can
I think I can, I think I can

Way deep down south, where we play this game
It's them Quad City DJs and you
We call it the train
So if you wanna ride your thing
Just come on down the train

We gonna rock, ooh, Lord, just jump aboard, baby
So get your next of kin, your sister and your friend
Pack it up now, Choo Choo, ride on this, Choo Choo
And, boo, you need to stop faking, and come on with me
