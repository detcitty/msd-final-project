The way you're bathed in light reminds me of that night
God laid me down into your rose garden of trust
And I was swept away with nothin' left to say
Some helpless fool yeah I was lost in a swoon of peace
You're all I need to find so when the time is right
Come to me sweetly, come to me, come to me

Love will lead us, alright
Love will lead us, she will lead us
Can you hear the dolphin's cry?
See the road rise up to meet us
It's in the air we breathe tonight
Love will lead us, she will lead us

Oh yeah, we meet again, it's like we never left
Time in between was just a dream
Did we leave this place? This crazy fog surrounds me
