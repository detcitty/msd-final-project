We get it on most every night
And when that old moon gets so big and bright
It's a supernatural delight
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight

Everybody here is outta sight
They don't bark and they don't bite
They keep things loose, they keep things light
Everybody was dancin' in the moonlight

Dancin' in the moonlight
Everybody's feelin' warm and right
