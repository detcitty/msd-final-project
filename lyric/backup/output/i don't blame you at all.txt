I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
You don't owe me a thing 'cause I played the fool
No no no no no
I'm only payin' the price for a trip I took to paradise
'Cause I looked into a pair of eyes
& what I thought was the look of love was only hurt in disguise
Too bad I didn't realize, oh but don't apologize, no, 'cause...
I don't blame you at all 'cause you played it cool
