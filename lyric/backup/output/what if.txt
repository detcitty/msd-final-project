(diane warren)

Sometimes I don't understand.
Feels like I'm living in a world gone mad.
Look around, all around it's just the same.
People just rush everywhere.
No time to ever take the time to care.
We're the ones.
We're the losers in this game.
So where is the tenderness we scarifice for progress.
And where is the love we need.
