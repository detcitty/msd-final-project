The United States dollar
Took another pounding
On German, French and
British exchanges this morning
Hitting the lowest point
Ever known in West Germany

It has declined there
By forty-one percent since 1971
And this Canadian thinks it's time
To speak up for the Americans
As the most generous and possibly
The least appreciated people
In all the Earth

As long as sixty years ago when
I first started to read newspapers
I read of floods on the
Yellow River and the Yangtze
Who rushed in with
Men and money to help
The Americans did

They have helped control floods
On the Nile, the Amazon
The Ganges and the Niger
Today the rich bottom land
Of the Mississippi is under water
And no foreign land has sent
A dollar to help

Germany, Japan and to a lesser extent
Britain and Italy were lifted out of
The debris of war by the Americans
Who poured in billions of dollars
And forgave other billions in debts
None of those countries is today
Paying even the interest on it's
Remaining debts to the United States

When the Franc was in danger
Of collapsing in 1956
It aas the Americans
Who propped it up
