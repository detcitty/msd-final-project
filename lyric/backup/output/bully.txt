It's 8 AM, this hell I'm in
Seems I've crossed a line again
For being nothing more than who I am
So break my bones and throw your stones
We all know that life ain't fair
But there's more of us we're everywhere

We don't have to take this back against the wall
We don't have to take this we can end it all
