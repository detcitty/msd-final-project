If I'm a bad person, you don't like me
I guess I'll make my own way.
It's a circle. I mean cycle.
I can't excite you anymore.
Where's your gavel? Your jury?
What's my offense this time?
You're not a judge but if you're gonna judge me
Well, sentence me to another life.

Don't wanna hear your sad songs!
I don't wanna feel your pain!
When you swear it's all my fault
But you know we're not the same.
We're not the same! Oh, we're not the same!
That the friends who stuck together
We wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept
That the change is good.
But it's good, it's good!
