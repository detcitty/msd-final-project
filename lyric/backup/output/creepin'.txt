Like a honeybee beatin' on my screen door
I got a little buzz in my head and it's sore
And from the my bed I can feel the sun
Lord, 'round here the mornin' come
Justa creepin'
Creepin'
Creepin'
Creepin'

You shot outta hell like a bullet from a gun
A flip of a switch
a thief on the run
And since the day you left me, baby
I can feel the lonely
I can hear the crazy
Justa creepin'
Creepin'
Justa creepin'
Creepin'

Head for the future
Run from the past
Hide from the mirror
