Y'all know what this is
This is what you need to do girl
Let me hold you

I been watching you for a minute
Come through here so sweet scented
In life girl you need me in it
I'm determined to win it

I know what you need
I know what's wrong
I know how to make it tight
Everything'll be all right
If ya let me hold you

And introduce you to my world
And introduce you to the better side of life
That you ain't been seein' girl
I'ma show you where it's at
And I'ma show you how to get it
All you got do is be wit it
And let me hold you

Down like a real man's supposed to
I never would have approached you
If I ain't have intentions on doing good
See dude you wit is so fooled
To me girl you're so cool
And all I'm asking you to do is
Let me hold you

Down like a best friend and two homies in the game
When you cry I wanna feel your pain
No secrets, no games
All excitement, nothing plain
Keep you happy that's my aim
And all you gotta do girl is
Let me hold you

In my arms, in my mind, all the time
