There was a time, not too far gone
When I was changed by just a song
On the radio and in the car
The pounding of an electric guitar

Then the time came to make our stand
We started up a four-piece band
And the heat felt like spotlights
In the heart of a hot summer night, yeah

wooo.ooo.ooo .oooooo... ooo... ooo... oooh
