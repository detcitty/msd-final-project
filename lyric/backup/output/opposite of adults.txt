Fresh Kid Z, Fresh Kid C, Fresh Kid P, Fresh Kid T, Oh yeah we back!
Oh and Xaphoon got a little, yeah Jones,
Yeah, Chiddy Bang and We Pretty Much Amazing
Can we hear the song please? I got you

Ay yo I once was a kid all I had was a dream
Mo money mo problems, when I get it imma pile it up
Now I'm dope Wonderbread we can toast
So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us
Ay yo I once was a kid with the other little kids
Now I'm rippin' up shows and 'em fans goin' wild with us
Tell mommy I'm sorry

This life is a party

Remember you was a kid
Reminisce days of the innocence
Now it's Chiddy Bang, google me in the images
Follow me, follow me I'm the leader
And when I park cars I don't pay for the meter
I remember I was younger as a kid it was the best
I used touch on all the pretty girls at recess
I'm at my peak yes, I won't leave yet
