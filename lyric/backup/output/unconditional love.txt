What a man
You know it's a bright and shiny day
I want to say something to you
I love you just like Ja do

We know a place
Where Ja's people can run free
A new kind of love
And we call it agape

Don't take too long to find
True love transcends all time
That non-reacting, everlasting love

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return
