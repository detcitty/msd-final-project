Go, hey little mama
I can transform ya
No I can't dance, but I can dance on ya
Swiss on the beat, Chris move your feet
Maybe I can transform a him to a me
I can change ya life, make ya so new
Make ya never wanna go back to the old you
So rock in the line, give it a Lil time
She gonna transform like Optimus Prime
Need a ride? I can rig you up
Money? I can change you up
You can have your own, no longer be the passenger
Swag? No? I'll build you up
Knees you got spend you up
Red lips, red dress
Like 'em like a firetruck
What you need?
You can have that
My black card
