Ah
Here we go again
It's time to get down
Sexy mama

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Do it to me now, baby, yeah

Come on sexy mama
Come on lay back and let me soothe you
Take it easy, baby
Let me do what I wanna do to you

I wanna open up them love gates
To my heaven
This afternoon I know you'll like me
By tonight you're gonna love me
