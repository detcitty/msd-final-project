The moment was custom made to order
I was ridin' with my daughter on our way back from Monroe
An' like children do she started playin' twenty questions'
But I never would've guessed one could touch me to my soul

She said, "Daddy, when we get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way?
Are we goin' there to visit or are we goin' there to stay?
Am I gonna see my Grandpa? Can I have a pair of wings?
