Ayah: nak, hati-hati lah dalam melangkah
Anak: tidak ayah, ayah yg berhati-hati, karena aku akan mengikuti langkahmu
If your dream house
Is a double-wide trailer sitting back in the holler

On a country road
Then, baby, that's where we'll go
If you don't wanna settle down
We can bounce around from town to town

And that's fine with me
If you wanna just ride the breeze
I'll go anywhere, West Virginia, baby I don't care
