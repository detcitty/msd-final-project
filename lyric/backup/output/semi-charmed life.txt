Doo doo doo, doo doo-doo doo...

I'm packed and I'm holdin'
I'm smilin', she's livin', she's golden
She lives for me, says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile, like a drug for you
Do ever what you wanna do, comin' over you
Keep on smilin' what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said...

I want somethin' else, to get me through this
Semi-charmed kinda life, baby, baby
I want somethin' else, I'm not listenin' when you say good-bye
