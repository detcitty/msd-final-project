She's addicted to nicotine patches
She's addicted to nicotine patches
She's afraid of a light in the dark
6.58 are you sure where my spark is
Here, here, here

She's convinced she could hold back a glacier
But she couldn't keep baby alive
Doubting if there's a woman in there somewhere
Here, here, here

You say you don't want it again and again
