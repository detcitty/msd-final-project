Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She's a girl I used to know

I saw you standing in the corner
And I pretended not to see
You were looking over your shoulder
Then you turned away from me

My friends all asked me if I knew you
I did not know quite what to say
So many reasons to forget you
Cause I can't bring back yesterday
