You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can pull all the cards

But I won't back down, oh, no
I won't back down, oh, no

Cadillac Sevilles, Coupe De Villes
Brain dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth and nails
Try to fight it, try to deny it

Stupid you will feel, what I do, I do at will
Shooting from the hip, yeah boy shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my death bed
Screaming F that yeah super Ill

Baby, what the deal, we can chill
Split half a pill and a happy meal, fuck a stank slut
I cut my toes off and step on the receipt before I foot the bill
Listen garden tool don't me introduce you to my power tool
You know the fucking drill

How you douche bags feel knowing you're disposable?
Summers eve Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal, baby, crank the shit
'Cause it's your God damn jam
You say that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shawty, I'm that man

These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said
Settle ya fuckin ass down I'm ready for combat, man
Get it calm Batman?

Nah, ain't nobody whose as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like mum's cat scans
Cause they fucking dope bananas, honey I applaud that ass
Swear to God man these moms can't dance, ma show 'em how it's done
