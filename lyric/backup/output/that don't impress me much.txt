I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius
you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original know-it-all

Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
