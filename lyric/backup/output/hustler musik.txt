Missed and hit a nigga in his head with this one

I'm gonna paint the city red with this one
I'm ahead with this one
See you fucking with the boys who tote toys way before Christmas.

No assistance just That persistence with That commitment if - I don't get it somebody gonna die tonight -
I know my vibe is tight - And I deserve the throne - if the kid ain't right - then let me die in his souls.
I'll be riding

Riding alone
with my daddy on my mind like you gotta be kidding

How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king
Shall be
So I be who I be
That's me, that's Weezy F. Baby and
Please say the motherfucking
So I be who I be
That's me, that's Weezy F. Baby and
