This is the tale I'm afraids unfolding
Mini earthquakes and a gun unloading
Volleys of thoughts into the back of my brain
Taking me over like rock cocaine
I don't do junk but I'm familiar with the feeling
The ghosts are so close I can hear them breathing
Spitting their bile down the back of my throat
Ain't you ever wondered why they call it dope?
I used to run around with a head like soup can
Like a train, popping pills like Pac-Man
But beneath my skin and along my spine
I could feel a fleet of cockroaches prying
Waiting for me to take my first hit
I knew right then that I didn't need that shit
Like a window reflecting time
Livin' on a planet of my own design

Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say
Yeah, whoah,
I can feel the sugarcane flow,
Every time I change my mind.
Hear all the people say

It's like the man said, you gotta move on up
