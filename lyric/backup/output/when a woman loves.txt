When a woman loves
She, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real

She took me back
After I broke my heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl she raised me
And I'm forever indebted, and I'm forever indebted
I'm forever indebted to her cause

When a woman loves
