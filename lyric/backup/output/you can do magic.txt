Since you've been gone, since you've been unglued
It's hard to figure out your next move
One minute here the next you're gone
Let's make an end to this sad, sad song
For you it's hard to take
'Cause the pill has an awful taste
Just open up and swallow down
Once it hits bottom things may turn around
