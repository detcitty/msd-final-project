Can't you see that I am all for your love
Now, Now -
Can't you see
Can't you see
How much I need some more love
Baby
Can't you see
Can't you see
Ever since we kissed that night
Ever since I held you tight
I just don't want nobody else
So put your lips on mine
Leave them there 'til the morning time
Lord don't leave me by myself

Lay a little lovin' on me
Lay a little lovin' on me
Honey doggone it
I depend upon it
