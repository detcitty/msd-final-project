An empty room can be so deafening
The silence makes you wanna scream
It drives you crazy.
I chased away the shadows of your name
And burned the picture in a frame
But it couldn't save me.

And how could we quit something we never even tried

Well you still can't tell me why.
We built it up
To watch it fall.
Like we meant nothing at all.
I gave and gave the best of me
But couldn't give you what you need.
