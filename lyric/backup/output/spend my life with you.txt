(Eric)
I never knew such a day could come
And I never knew such a love
Could be inside of one
And I never knew what my life was for
But now that you're here I know for sure

(Tamia)
I never knew till I looked in your eyes
I was incomplete till the day you walked into my life
And I never knew that my heart could feel
So precious and pure
One love so real

(Eric and Tamia)
Can I just see you every morning when
I open my eyes
Can I just feel your heart beating beside me
Every night
Can we just feel this way together
Till the end of all time
Can I just spend my life with you
