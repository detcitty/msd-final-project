I've had a bad day
And nothing ever seems to go my way
I've got a heartache
Don't wanna think about it

And every time I try to smile, I cry
So, I'll just hide my face
Get out of my way
Don't wanna talk about it

And I'll be fine
I just need some time

I'm hanging on today
And nothing's gonna stop me anyway
I'm holding on, I'm strong
I'm the only one who can make it change

I don't want advice
I've gotta live my life
I'm gonna make it alright
