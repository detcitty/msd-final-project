How I wish you could see the potential
The potential of you and me
It's like a book elegantly bound
But in a language that you can't read just yet

You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love
I will possess your heart

You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find love
I will possess your heart
