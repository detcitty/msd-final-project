Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
You just save me when my life came tumbling down
And I know you're gonna leave me
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time

Yeah, like a charm, baby
Brighter than this thing on my arm, baby
It's a party every time you come around, baby
Now if you're down, baby
I can be the ground, baby, hear me running
Ain't nothing looking better than when I see you coming
Ain't none other feeling better than when I'm blowing money
You can tell that I'm an addict, I'm addicted to money
I'm addicted to balling

I got the sip of Patron, I bought a ticket to Rome
And by the end of the evening, forget a weekend
We won't even know what planet we're on
Cause Monday, so many, goddamn it
