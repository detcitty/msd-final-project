Someone's sleeping on the sidewalk
As the winter sun goes down
Someone's drinking cold champagne
In another part of town
And the only thing he thinks about
As he sips his glass of wine
It sure feels good sitting here tonight
Now that I've got mine
I've got mine, I've got mine
This isn't such a bitter world
Cause I've got mine

Someone's wandering the streets tonight
