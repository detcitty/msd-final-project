I was dealin' up and down the highway

Till they caught me with a heavy load

They sentenced me to hard labor
Workin' on the side of the road

Now I don't deny I was guilty
And I know I broke the law
I was hungry and broke and couldn't see no hope
And my back was up against the wall

Now I'm right outside your window
Honey open up and let me in

I broke out of jail this mornin'
And I ain't never goin' back again
