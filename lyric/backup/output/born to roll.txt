Braniac, dumb-dumb, bust the scientifical
Approach to the course and the force is centrifugal
Can ya find ya way through the lyrics that be cathcin em
Throw another rhyme across the room they be fetchin em
And they take a loss, take a loss to the master and i
Throws crazy blows and they knows i be plasterin
All across the room on the ceilings and the walls to
Punk little suckers didn't know i had the gall to
Come around they block with my cocked diesel system and
Turn it up to 10 and then start to dis em and
They didn't wanna battle if they did when they saw me
They'd a open up they trunk but they try to ignore me
Hey little suckers i know you hear me callin you
Cause you wanted some but i see that you ougta do
Frontin ain't no future and you're frontin so let's get i on
Like marvin gaye, take the cash and siti it on
The hood of ya wick-wack low-ridin cadillac
Back up ya boys and let's start the battle
