'Til we get it
I'mma get it... 'til we get it...
'Til we get it

I'mma get it... 'til we get it...

You say all you need is consistent love
When I try I swear it's never enough - I messed up
Maybe this thing here just ain't meant for us
Baby you let go and I pull you back

I let you go, you ain't having that

We do it like we're rock stars

Sexing in my hotel room, I be so loud

Higher than a smoke cloud
Shades on doing 95 with the top down

I might sound crazy
