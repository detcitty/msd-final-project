Monday morning was the first time
That I noticed something strange
Going on with you, your kiss was not the same
Was it all just in my mind
Or was it something I should pay attention to?

Then on Tuesday
Having lunch with friends I thought I saw your car
Leaving from our favorite restaurant but too far
For my eyes to see what I feel
Would be heartbreaking if what I saw was true

Wednesday evening
Every time the phone would ring you'd say, "Hello"
But when I'd come around you'd say, "I gotta go"
Your friends never called line two before
And I don't know nobody named Tyra

Ho, now it's Thursday
You left the house to go to work an hour early
Said you had some papers for your boss to sign
But you left your briefcase home and when I called your job
