Saturday morning, jumped out of bed
And put on my best suit
Got in my car, raced like a jet
All the way to you

Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man
Yeah, yeah

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing till the day I die
"Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is no!"

Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway

Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
