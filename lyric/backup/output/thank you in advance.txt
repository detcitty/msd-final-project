Excuse me, i know we just met
but may i have this dance?
Sitting here with a drink in my hand
your presence i can't ignore
i must admit i like watching you dance
but it seems like i've seen this before
girl, you look like my first wife
though i've never been married before
so i kiss your hand and tell you "thank you"
you turn and ask me what for
For our first kiss, oh, next week
for when we make love, in six weeks
for the ring you wore probably three months from now
for when you said "i do" next march
