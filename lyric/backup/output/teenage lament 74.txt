What a drag it is
These gold lame' jeans
Is this the coolest way
To get though your teens
Well, I cut my hair weird
I read that it was in
I looked like a rooster
That was drowned and raised again

What are you gonna do
Tell you what I'm a-gonna do
Why don't you get away-ay
I'm gonna live today-ay

I ran into my room
And I fell down on my knees
I thought that fifteen
Was gonna be a breeze
I picked up my guitar
To blast away the clouds
But somebody in the next room yelled
"You gotta turn that damn thing down"

What are you gonna do
Tell you what I'm a-gonna do
Why don't you get away-ay
