When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son?
One more son
If you can't hold on

If you can't hold on, hold on
I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know, you know, no you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on, in the hearts of men

I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand
Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well it comes and goes

I need direction to perfection, no no no no
Help me out, yeah
