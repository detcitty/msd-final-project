You ready?
Let's go!
Yeah...
For those of you that want to know what we're all about
It's like this y'all, c'mon

This is 10% luck, 20% skill
15% concentrated power of will
5% pleasure, 50% pain
And 100% reason to remember the name

Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else
Alone in spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality and makin' some noise
Makin' the story
Makin' sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin' it up, let's go

Who the hell is he anyway?
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin' them star struck
