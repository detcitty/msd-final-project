After all of this time that we tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same

The way that I love
The way that I love you
The way that I love
The way that I love you
The way that I love
The way that I love you

I woke up kinda early today
And something told me from that moment it wouldn't be the same
It felt like you were hiding something
But I didn't push it, I didn't complain or say nothing

I tried to act like I didn't see it
'Cause deep down I knew I didn't want to believe it
But there it was, it was you and her
You left your Sidekick on the nightstand and I read

Everything you bought and everything you said
And now I'm standing here looking like damn
