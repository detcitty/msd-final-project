(William "Smokey" Robinson)

Now there's a theory
That everybody has a love somewhere
(Somewhere) Yeah (Somewhere)

But I had begin to believe
That mine wasn't there, oh, oh
Oh but then, you came to me and proved the theory
And all of my days
I wanna have you near me with a...
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love
That's all I need now
Your wonderful sweet, sweet love

Oh, oh I'd be searching here and there
