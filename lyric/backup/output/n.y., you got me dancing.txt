Baby, baby with your hard luck story
You need a place to show to win
You'd still be waiting for me at the airport
While my ship was coming in
And New York, you're keeping me dancing
So don't you beware, don't you beware
Keep on dancing
Don't you beware, don't you beware
Keep on dancing
So don't you beware, don't you beware
Keep on dancing
So don't you beware, don't you beware
Keep on dancing
New York, New York, you keep me dancing, dancing
New York, New York, you keep me dancing, dancing
I'm so glad I saw your ad on every avenue
