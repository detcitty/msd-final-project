Wild like wild life

Yeah, no telling what I might do
When I'm the right mood, you know me
I'm all up in the party like a V.I.P
And everything is looking better from my POV
Nocturnal animals, we don't sleep
And I'll probably forget you,
Cee lo green (cee-lo)
I'm saying like the amazon
A hundred degrees and that backsides bigger than a family tree.
So drop that thing like a fumble
Like ya talking to the king of the jungle
We got lions, tigers, bears oh my!
Every single ones turnt up, yo
I don't want anybody bringing the vibes down
So if you wanna wind down
Oh look what I found
A little something that will keep you awake until the break of dawn
Don't be afraid to get ready

I'm not done yet
