I got your back boy

When we're were high, when we're were low
(From when it's all good, to when it's all bad)
When I promise I will never let you go
(Now what you call that?)

Said I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy

(Yeah, you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(I know you got my back, right?)
Keep my swagger, keep it looking good for ya
Keep it looking hood for ya, and, shawty, if you don't know
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy

(Yeah, you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy
(Of the world though, you got my back, right?)

Hey, it's whatever shawty, you ain't gotta ask
Yes, Valentino blouses, summer houses, cash, check
You can get it, you deserve it, flawless diamonds, Louis purses

My mission's to purchase earth for her, present the gift without the curse
Her pleasure is my purpose, pleasure to be at your service
We front row at fashion shows, as well as Sunday morning service
For better days or for worse, if I'm paid I'm hurting in my pocket

She still got a nigga back, know that's for sure
