Fortunately you have
Got someone who relies on you
We started out as friends
But the thought of you just caves me in The symptoms are so deepIt is much too late to turn away
We started out as friends

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady
