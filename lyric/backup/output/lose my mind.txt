Why y’all trip, I’m just fine
Twelve forty five, ‘Bout that time
Ain’t done it all week time to unwind
Trend like tank, lose my mind

This shit crazy, way to bad
Rozay baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can’t spell sober, lose my mind

I’m hearin’ voices in my head think im schizoprenic
I swear they sayin’ lets get it from another planet
Thirty six thousand times I’m doin’ summer salts
Do it right and you can leave ya whole summer off
I’m out my mind, yeah a nigga seein’ double ya’ll
Tell me what’s the chance of jeezy fuckin’ both of ya’ll
She sad as long as we can do it with ya ice on
You dedicated my will, Leave the lights on
I’m out my mind, just blew a thousand swisher sweets
In my black and orange charger, call it trick or treat
It ain’t nothin’ to a boss, my goons got goons
How stupid dumb big, my rooms got rooms
