What would the music be without the sounds?
Young Boss, Miss Trina, Pitbull
Let's show 'em how we get down

I party like a rock star
Look like a movie star
Play like an all-star
Fuck like a porn star

Baby, I'm a superstar
Always posted at the bar
Always with a couple broads
Maybe I'm just that, that raw

Dawg, check your resume
I hit somethin’ every day
Ask about me and they'll say
That chico run MIA

Pitbull, Young Boss, that’s fire
Go girl, work it out ‘til you tired
Just tryin’ to pay tuition? Liar
My corner is like HBO's Wire

So please don't play no games
And, baby, don't say no names
And we can do this one more again
Next time you can bring your friends

So get your friends
And I’ll get my friends
And we can be friends
Do this every weekend

We can hit your place
We can hit my place
She’s on my top 8
