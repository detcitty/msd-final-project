I've always been one of them boys
Rollin' around in jacked up toys
Making noise on small town Friday nights

Red light running, good time chasing,
Guess I've earned this reputation
Probably never shake it but that's alright

I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fightin' side after a few
If they wanna see my sweet side
