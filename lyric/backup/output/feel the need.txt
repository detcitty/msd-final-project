Ee how I'm walking
See how I'm talking
Notice everything in me

Feel the need, oh
Feel, feel the need in me

I need you by my side
To be my guide
Can't you see my arms
Are open wide, mm hmm

Feel the need, oh
Feel, feel the need in me

(I need your love)
Every day, I need it
(Love) every day, I want it
(Love) without your sweet
Sweet love, I'd rather die

(I need your love)
I need it constantly
(Love) your love takes care of me
(Love) your love is better
