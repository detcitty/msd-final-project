It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more love
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'
It's a shame to complain, but we got to have a lot more lovin'

Inside this world there's lots of casul lovers
Unselfish lovin' they leave to the others
They got to have it
They can't do without it
But ain't just a shame the way that they go about it

[Chorus]
