Is this a dream
Or could it be that I'm just imagining
Is there some chance for our romance
To become reality

Did I hear you say
There was a chance for our love
A chance for us to play the game
Or to play the game

All night long I tried to remember
What is some thing that you said
Did you say that to me, baby

Ooh, just one touch from you (One touch from you)
Little girl, I come unglued
I lose all trace of time
And everything seems to slip my mind

Got to find the right solution (The right solution)
Got to find a way to end all this confusion
In my mind
