Kiss me hard before you go,
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know,
That baby, you're the best

I got my red dress on tonight,
Dancing in the dark in the pale moon light
Done my hair up real big,
Beauty queen style

High heels off,
I'm feeling alive
Oh, my god
I feel it in the air,
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare

Honey, I'm on fire
I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore. (One, two, three, four)
