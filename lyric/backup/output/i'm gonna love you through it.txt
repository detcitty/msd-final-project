She dropped the phone and burst into tears
The doctor just confirmed her fears
Her husband held it in and held her tight
Cancer don't discriminate or care if you're just 38
With three kids who need you in their lives
He said, I know that you're afraid and I am, too
But you'll never be alone, I promise you

When you're weak, I'll be strong
When you let go, I'll hold on
