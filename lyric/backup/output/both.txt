Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

I got so many felonies I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings
So let me check my calendar
I just popped one of them one what-you-call-its
And it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister
Guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all red drop tarantula
Fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners bruh
Where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up
Ho pull your panties up
