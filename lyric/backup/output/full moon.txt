Boy, I saw you soon as you came bouncin' through the door
You and your mans and them just look over the floor
Started doin' your thing and it made me notice you even more
The way, you turned around and looked at me it seemed as though
You must have somehow felt me starin' on the low
Somethin' tells me you're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know

I ain't even gonna front, I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club, I've been givin' you the eye
We can dance if you want, get it crackin' if you like
Must be a full moon, feel like one of those nights
