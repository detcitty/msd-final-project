Darling, these last few days
Have been almost unbearable
I mean, nothing is going right
Since you've been gone

Nothing to do
No place to go
Nothing good comes
On the TV anymore
Since you've been gone
My whole world is
Just one big drag

Uh huh, baby
I've been missing you
Uh huh, baby
I've been missing you
