Three years come
I'm still alone and you're so lonely
I look in the mirror
I see those lines on my face
All of my dreams are gone
Flyin' with the starlings
But they were not stolen gems
Colored glass I can replace
You've got a restless heart
Restless change is blowing
through your life
Tears in your eyes
Tears in the books that I've been reading
I don't understand you now
And I never did
