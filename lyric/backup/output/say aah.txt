Let's go!

Hey, when I give you these keys homboy don't move my car man
I'm right in the front ya dig
Don't move my shit man
Whoa baby what's your name

Go girl its ya birthday
Open wide I know you're thirsty
Say ahhh
Say ahhh
And we don't buy no drinks at the bar
Pop champagne cause we got that dough
Let me hear you say ahhh
You want me say ahhh

Pocket full of money
club don't jump
Till I walk inside the doorway
Bottles of that Ros√©
