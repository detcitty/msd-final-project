Oh I drink and take a sip of it
Feelin' like a hypocrite
Go for more and I won't give a shit
I never used to talk, I never used to talk like

I'm sorry I named the album Montevallo
And I'm sorry people know your name now
And strangers hit you up on social media
I'm sorry you can't listen to the radio
And drive out to the place where we used to get peaches down in Pelham
I know you want your privacy
And you've got nothing to say to me
But I wish you'd let me pay of your student loans
To these songs you gave to me
Remember the first time you stayed with me
Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMA's with me
Two years later it felt like you were a million miles away from me
And I was the one on stage, drunk
