Your wardrobe's purchased
At the latest boutique
Your place is furnished
Like the President's suite

Your freezer's filled up
With the finest of meat
Somehow you manage
On a hundred a week

They say you like to feel
White gold on your neck
They say when you make love
You like to direct

And that new sports car
