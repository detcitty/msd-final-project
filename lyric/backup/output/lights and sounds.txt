Hello you, how was the rest?
You made it through, but nevertheless,
I got you out on a wire.
You be love and I'll be a liar.

Tell it all and fill up the air,
But make it loud cause nobody's there.
And nobody's there.
And nobody's there.

Stop, turn, take a look around,
At all the lights and sounds.
Let them bring you in.
Slow burn, let it all fade out,
And pull the curtain down.
I wonder where you've been?
