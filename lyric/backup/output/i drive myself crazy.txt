(CHRIS) Ohh... ohhh...
Lying in your arms
So close together
Didn't know just what I had
Now I toss and turn
Cause I'm without you
How I'm missing you so bad
Where was my head
Where was my heart
Now I cry alone in the dark...

(CHRIS & ALL) I lay awake
I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
(CHRIS) Thinking of you
(CHRIS & ALL) Made a mistake
When I let you go baby
(CHRIS) I drive myself crazy
(CHRIS & ALL)Wanting you the way that I do...
(JOEY) Wanting you the way that I do...

(JUSTIN) I was such a fool
I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me... (just how good you were to me...) oh yeah
You confessed your (you confessed your love) love
Undying devotion
I confessed my need to be free...
And now I'm left
With all this pain
I've only got myself to blame... ohhh...

(ALL) I lay awake
I drive myself crazy (JUSTIN-oh yeah...)
Drive myself crazy
(JUSTIN) Thinking of you...
(ALL) Made a mistake (JUSTIN-ooh yeah)
When I let you go baby (JUSTIN-you go)
(JUSTIN) I drive myself crazy
(CHRIS & ALL)Wanting you the way that I do...
(JUSTIN & JOEY) Wanting you the way that I do...

(JC) Why... didn't I know it
(ALL) (How much I love you baby)
(JC) Why... couldn't show it
(ALL) (If I had only told you...)
(JC) When I had the chance...
Oh I had the chance... ohh...

(ALL) Oooh... oooh... oooh...
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
(LANCE) la, la, la, la
(ALL) la, la, la, la

(JC & ALL) I lay awake
I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy
(JC) Thinking of you
(ALL) Made a mistake (JC-made a mistake...)
Let you go baby
(JC) I drive myself crazy
(CHRIS & ALL)Wanting you the way that I do...

(JC & ALL) I lay awake (I lay awake...)
I drive myself crazy (I drive... myself...)
Drive myself crazy (crazy... crazy, crazy, crazy, yeah...)
