I spent fifteen hundred dollars on your damn dog's collar
Put new spinners on your Escalade
I swear I almost started cryin' when you brought up buyin' diamonds
Lord, I'm spendin' more than I'm gettin' paid

You got more purses than Versace, got more rings than Liberace
Fill your closet full of fancy shoes
All my credit cards are cookin'
Girl, you don't know what you're puttin' me through

It's a business doin' pleasure
A business doin' pleasure with you
