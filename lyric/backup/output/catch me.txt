Before I fall
Too fast
Kiss me quick
But make it last
So I can see
How badly this will hurt me
When you say goodbye

Keep it sweet
Keep it slow
Let the future pass
And don't let it go
But tonight
I could fall too soon
To this beautiful moonlight

But you're so hypnotizing
You've got me laughing while I sing
