My motorcycle needs an oil change
Fence needs mending, house needs paint
I got a million things that need to be done but
Baby I can only focus on one

The way you're looking back at me right now
I'm thinking about everything I shouldn't be thinking about
You're playing with my mind, baby ain't no doubt
