We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, its like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

Ya boy gettin' paper (Money), I buy big cars (Foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (Choose one)
Stay sky high (Twisted), Fly wit the stars (Twinkle, Twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (Ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missing (Flossin')
I'm sitting clean with the bottom kitted (do it)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistening (Ballin'!)
But I spent bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doing the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (What else?)
