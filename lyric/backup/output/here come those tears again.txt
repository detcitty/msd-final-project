Here come those tears again just when I was getting over you
Just when I was going to make it through another night without missing you
Thinking I might just be strong enough after all
When I hear your footsteps echoing in the hall

Baby, here we stand again where we've been so many times before
Even though you looked so sure as I was watching you walking out my door
