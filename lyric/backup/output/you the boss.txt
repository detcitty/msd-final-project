You the boss (boss)
You, you, you the boss, man
You, you, you the boss, man

You, you, you the boss, man

Rozay a born stunna
I can blow money (uh)

I need me a dime
Livin this fast life
Just show me a sign

To the condo on the beach
All she needs
A, a, a, all she needs
Is a boss on my level
Who provides her every need (need)
