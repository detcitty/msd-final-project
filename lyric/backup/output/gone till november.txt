I dedicate this record the carnival to all you brothers takin' long trips
Down south, Virginia, Baltimore all round the world
And your girl gets this message that you ain't comin' back
She sittin' back in her room, da lights is off
She's cryin', and then my voice comes in pow
And in the middle of the night and this is what I tell her for you
Every time I make a run, girl you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why?
See you must understand I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone till November
Said I'll be gone till November, I'll be gone till November
You tell my girl I'll be gone till November, I'll be gone till November
I'll be gone 'til November, you tell my girl yo I'll be gone till November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin' but girl I can't stay
