I've spent too much time
Waiting for you in vain
I can't hear your voice
Although I call your name
I can't go on but I still hang on just the same

I've spent endless nights
Crying you name out loud
But still remain
Alone in an empty crowd
As time goes on I realize you'll never change

I say a prayer
