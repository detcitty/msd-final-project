It's hard to stop doing something
That's good to you, yeah, yeah
It's hard to stop doing something
That's good to you

It's hard to stop doing something
That's sweet to you, ooh
It's hard to stop doing something
That's good to you

I love a man
Who never stays at home, no
He's always out on the street
