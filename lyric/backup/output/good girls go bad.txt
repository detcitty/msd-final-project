I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go
Good girls go bad, good girls go bad

I know your type, you're daddy's little girl
Just take a bite
(One bite)
Let me shake up your world
'Cause just one night couldn't be so wrong
I'm gonna' make you lose control

She was so shy till I drove her wild
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go bad

When hanging in the corner
With your five best friends
You heard that I was trouble
But you couldn't resist
