Rock Mafia

For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way, yep
24 hours a day 'cause I'm hot like that
Every guy everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always get a ten 'cause I'm built like that

I go through guys like money flying out their hands
They try to change me but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never planned
If you're gonna be my man, understand

I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
