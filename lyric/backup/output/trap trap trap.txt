Beep
Beep
I'm sittin' at the red light
My ankle monitor beepin'
Hadn't been charged
I think I see the beeper
Bounce

I took my roof off at the red light
I took my roof off at the red light
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Brown bag legend 'cause it's all cash
Brown bag legend when it's all cash
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap
Trap, trap, trap, trap, trap, trap

First one on the block, woah
I need mine off the top, uh
Over town, he got shot
Muddy died in Opa-locka
Couldn't save one lung
Hit 'em up, hmm, hmm
See the look on my face (woo!)
Like Carol City one state
Niggas hate on my sound
'Til I went the first round
Then I earnt the Lombardi
Ain't no fuckboys allowed
Only fuck if she exclusive
Her favorite rapper Lil Boosie
To tell the truth I didn't ask
When it come to bitches I'm Gucci
I'm the wrong one to rob
In the jungle I'm Nas
In the label I'm Russ
In the trap I'm Rick Ross
