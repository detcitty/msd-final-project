Lay down your funky weapon.
Yeah y'all, here we go
pumpin' the big noise in the 90's.

Pardon me 4 living, but this is my world 2
I can't help that what's cool to us might be strange to u
Pardon me 4 breathing, can we borrow some of your air?
the problem with u and your kind is that u don't know love is there

Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
making love and music's the only things worth fighting 4.
We r the new power generation, we want 2 change the world.
The only thing that's in our way is u.
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
we're sick and tired of u telling us what 2 do.
