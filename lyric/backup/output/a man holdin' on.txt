Two young lovers
With their bodies on fire
Achin' to swim
That river of desire

Leavin' innocence there
On the bank by their clothes
A man holdin' on to
A woman lettin' go

There's a man with a bottle
On the other side of town
Swimmin' with a memory
That he can't drown

Lord, it ain't sunk in
That she ain't comin' home
