Me no conversate with the fake, that part
All my bitches independent bitches, that part
I just want the paper, that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part

Ayy! That part
Bang this shit in the hood one time
Lil bitch I'm back and poppin'
Tell that ugly bitch to move away, I need more options
Broke? Then fix your pockets, all I do is profit

Quarter million, switchin' lanes... that part
Bet my bitch move the same old thing... that part
405 with the gun off safety... that part
Ayy I'm still tryna make that plate
Rich or poor, nigga, choose your fate
Style on top of style, nigga
Five years I've been rich, nigga
Drove Beamers down Fig, nigga
Pushed Porsches down Broadway
I've been doggin' different hoes, nigga
Got a chain that's worth the Rolls, nigga
Got an engine back with the top in it
Nigga drivin' it like it's a bomb in it

Me no conversate with the fake, that part
All my bitches independent bitches, that part
I just want the paper, that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part
