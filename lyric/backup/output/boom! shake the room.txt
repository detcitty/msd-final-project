Boom! Shake the Room
Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince


yo back up now and give a brother room
the fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom
mercy mercy mercy me
my life is a cage but on stage I'm free
hyped up syched up ready for wil'in'
standing in a crowd of girls like an island
I see the one I wanna sic come here cutie
I flip 'em around and then I work that booty
work the body work work the body
slow down girl you're 'bout to hurt somebody
oh and yo let's get just one thing clear
there's only one reason why I came here
ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)
ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)
ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go

Chorus:
Boom! shake-shake-shake the room
Boom! shake-shake-shake the room
Boom! shake-shake-shake the room
tic-tic-tic-tic Boom!
