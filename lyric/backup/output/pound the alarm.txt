Oh, oh, oh, come fill my glass up a little more
We 'bout to get up and burn this floor
You know we getting hotter and hotter
Sexy and hotter, let's shut it down

Yo, what I gotta do to show these girls that I own them
Some call me Nicki and some call me Roman
Skeeza, pleeza, I'm in Ibiza (whoa)
Giuseppe Zannotti my own sneaker
Sexy, sexy that's all I do
If you need a bad bitch
Let me call a few
Pumps on and them little mini skirts is out
I see some good girls, I'm a turn 'em out
Ok bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, what?
