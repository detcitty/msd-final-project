Hear the night music playing?
Don't you know what it's saying?
We should feel it together
Forever

Feel the beat and just hold on
To the sweet midnight flowing
Feel the music inside you
I'll be there too

Now's the time our dreams are finally coming true
Feels so good we're crying
Now's the time when it's down to me and you
Spread these wings, we'll be flying

Don't you know what the night can do?
Don't you know when it's touching you?
Don't you know what the night can do?
