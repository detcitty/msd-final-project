(written by Andy Gibb)
Without you, stood alone on the edge of time
Out of sight, but forever mine, without you
Sometime's there's no forgetting the night
When you reach for the stars, just to be where it's bright
But you left me behind, what a crazy goodbye

Without you, there ain't no love at all
