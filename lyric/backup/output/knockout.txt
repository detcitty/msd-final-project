Hey Barbie, ah, ah, ah, are you into black men?
He- hey hey hey Barbie! Hey I can be your black Ken
Wow! 'Cause once you go black, you never go back
She wore her hair black, with curls in the back
Then she threw that ass back, back, back
Then I fell to the mat, and after that
Everything went black

Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can, get the knockout
get the telephone please
It's emergency
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the knockout

Hey Barbie, can I call you Barbara? Haha
