Makin' love to you
Wasn't the right thing to do
What a price to pay
For the friend I could lose

Did you think you were misled
By the words you thought I said
When you know that I never meant to harm you

I could never be
What you want me to be
What a price to pay
To lose a friend this way

Did you think you were misled
By the words you thought I said
I never meant to harm you
What a price it is... 
... To pay

Gotta know?
The way the sun shines on your hair
