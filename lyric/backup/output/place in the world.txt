Searching every day to find my
Place in this world
Place in this world
I can't seem to remember what I've lost on the way
Fighting everyday to find my
Place in this world
Place in this world
I am starting to lose control

Show me the way to the light
Everything is turning black
Reminisce the days when I felt the joy
and it's
One last chance to get myself out
Only I can't believe what it is to come.

Feel the pain
I have kept to myself
Fly again
For one last time
Can't go back
To what I was
