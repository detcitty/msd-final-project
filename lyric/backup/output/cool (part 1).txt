I got a penthouse in Manhattan
Two more in Malibu
I bought a '87's Cadillac Seville, girl
I got a Mazarati too

I wear diamonds on my fingers
I got a couple on my toes
I wear the finest perfume money can buy
It keeps me smellin' like a rose

If you wonder how I do it
There's just one simple rule

I'm just cool, oh, oh, honey
Baby, can't you see?
Girl, I'm so cool
Ain't nobody bad like me?

COOL
What's that spell? COOL

I might dine in San Francisco
Dance all night in Rome
I go any freakin' place I want to
And my Lear jet brings me home

I got ladies by the dozens
I got money by the ton
Just ain't nobody better
Heaven knows that I'm the one

And it's all because of something
That I didn't learn in school

I'm just cool, cool, cool, cool
Honey, baby, can't you see?
Girl, I'm so cool, cool, cool, cool
Ain't nobody bad like me?

Sing it, baby, COOL
What's that spell? COOL
That spells cool
Cool, cool, cool, cool
Cool, cool, cool, cool

What time is it? Cool

Listen baby, it takes a lot of lovin'
