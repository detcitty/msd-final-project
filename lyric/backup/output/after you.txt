Raining again
I ought to get out from under
Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I don't wonder at all
And as for loving again
Somewhere somebody might need me
But where would it lead me?
I'd just be rising to fall
Love was easy to believe in
When you wanted me yesterday
But I couldn't feel the touch of time upon tomorrow
After you
What am I gonna be?
You took a part of me
As you were passing through
