You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh huh, that's right
I took your words and I believed in everything you said to me
Yeah huh, that's right

If someone said three years from now, you'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out, 'cause they're all wrong
I know better, 'cause you said forever and ever
