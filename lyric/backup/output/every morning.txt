Every morning there's a halo hangin'
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand

Couldn't understand how to work it out
Once again, as predicted
Left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out

Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
You know I wanna do it again

(Sugar Ray say) Ah
