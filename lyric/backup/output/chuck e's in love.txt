How come he don't come and P.I.P. with me
Down at the meter no more?
And how come he turn off the TV
And hang that sign on the door?
Well, we call, and we call
"How come?", we say
Hey, what could make a boy behave this way, yeah?

Well, he learned all of the lines now
And every time
He don't, uh, stutter when he talks
And it's true, it's true
He sure has acquired
This kind of cool and inspired sort of jazz when he walks
Where's his jacket and his old blue jeans?
