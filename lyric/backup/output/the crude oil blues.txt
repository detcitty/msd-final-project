Well, now listen people let me tell you some news
I’ll sing a song called the crude oil blues
We’re low on heat and all, we’re low on gas
And I’m so cold I’m about to freeze myself

We got the crude oil blues
‘Gon the winter time sure gettin' cold
To the bottom of my shoes

Well, my hands are shakin’ and my knees are weak
But it ain’t because of love, it’s from lack of heat
I've got the crude oil blues

I’m gonna tell you a story about this drunk I knew
