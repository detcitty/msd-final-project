"Oh... ho... ah...
Come on and rock me, ooh, girl
Oh... ooh... oh... ooh... ooh... oh...
Come on and rock me, ooh, girl

Hey, girl, long time no see
Do you have a little time to spend with me
I wanna know what's been going on
In your life, huh, talk to me, baby

Your hair, perfume you wear
Brings back memories, oh, of you and me
You look so fine, you blow my mind
All over again, ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...

So much has happened in my life
Since we parted
What about you
Now I've got myself together
And I know just what I want
And right now I know that it's you, you

Rock me tonight for old times sake
Would you, baby, hey
Roll with me tonight for old times sake
Ooh... ooh... ooh... oh... oh...
