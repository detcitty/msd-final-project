Ooooooh...
My mind has been blown to bits
I was just about to call it quits
An everyday problem, I didn’t stand a prayer
And you came along, and hope was there
There have been times when I thought that I
Could tune right up and break down and cry
You gave me your hand, you made me stand
You said be a man, yes I know you can
And each and every day, (yeah) you never fail to say
With me always stay, please don’t go away
And in return you I never will, you know I never will
And yes I never will, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Never, never let you go (Never let you go baby,)
(Never let you go baby,)
Never let oh, oh, oh (Never let you go baby,)
Ne-ver! (Never let no never, never, never, never let you go!)

I’d count rain drops on a rainy day
