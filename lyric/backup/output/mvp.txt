Yea lets take em back
uh-huh
[Game]
I need a real love Mary hollar at me if you need a real thug
we could ride through Compton to see real blood, real crypts,
and imma always hold you down thats real shit
I'm the Los Angeles King and you remind me of Mary the R&B Queen
I got the 411 whats crackin what I owe you for helping me go 4 times platinum
I had a kid to my life he's almost 2 i guess wat im tryin 2 say
is thank you for over ten years in the ghetto gospel
you paved the way for young black women of prosper
how you paint pictures
you deserve grammies and oscars
congratulation from me Aftermath and the "Dr"
so you could go ahead envy me
I'm Billboards top ten featuring 'MJB'

'91 i stepped in this game
After 'whats the 411' things aint been the same
and i cant complain but with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
but im so glad to be here
and my music's still sincere
lets get back to the story
all of this pain and glory
and '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
