I can't light
No more of your darkness
All my pictures
Seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired
And time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life
Too late to save myself from falling

I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Close the door and left me blind by the light
