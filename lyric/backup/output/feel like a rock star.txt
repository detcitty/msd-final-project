Do you smoke, do you drink
Do you yell out, Hank
Do you fold it in your pocket
Do you lock it in the bank
Jack it up, drop it down to the ground
Put the juice in the goose
Or the Coke in the Crown

Whatever makes you feel like a rock star
Yeah, you can kick it back chillin'
Or you can rock hard
You busted your butt all week
And now, it's your time to be
Whatever you wanna be
You can dress to kill, you can shoot to thrill
Try to seal the deal
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star
