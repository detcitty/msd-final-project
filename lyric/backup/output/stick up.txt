Help! I been robbed! 

Oh oh oh... 

Stick-up
Highway robbery
It's a felony
Heartbreak in the first degree

He walked into my life
Hungry for love
So sweet and cautiously
He cased my love

A devil in disguise
He fooled my heart
Tricked me into the dark
(Hold Up! ) I was shocked

Pulled his charm
Took me in his arms
Stole my love
