This is Gospel for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

Oh Woah-oh
(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)
Oh Woah-oh
(This is the beat of my heart This is the beat of my heart)

The gnashing teeth and criminal tounges
Conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet
