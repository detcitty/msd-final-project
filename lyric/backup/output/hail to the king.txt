Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets now orphans of war
Bodies hanging in the streets to adore
Royal flames will carve a path in chaos
Bringing daylight to the night
Death is riding into town with armor
They've come to take all your rights
Hail to the king. Hail to the one
Kneel to the crown. Stand in the sun
Hail to the king
