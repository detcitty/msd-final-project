Yo, I ain't a player, I just fuck alot
Jump on top of my dick and work them hips
Until I bust a shot

It doesn't stop, I'm only beginning
I'm boning your women, while you home all alone
I'm going up in 'em

Sending them back to you, mad at you
Don't catch a motha' fuckin' attitude, I'm just showing you
How this rapper do

Capital Punishment, when I'm up in there
Suckin' it, bustin' it out, nice blouse
Let me unbutton it

You fuckin' wit King Papi Chulo
And knockin' culo, poppin' mooners out the socket
Tryin' to ride wit the sumo

You know my rhymes is high
Word I be thrillin' 'em bitch be tryin' to ride
But the curb be killin' 'em

Fillin' 'em with the gas
My G's premium unleaded, come get it, first work the tongue
Then let the Pun hit it

Split it in half
