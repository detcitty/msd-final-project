I warned ya, baby
From time to time
But you just wouldn't listen
Wouldn't pay me no mind

So I'm movin' on
I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow
And it's all over now
I'm movin' on

That big eight wheeler
Movin' down the track
Means your true loving daddy
Ain't comin' back

I'm movin' on
I'm rollin' on
You're flyin' too high
For my little sky
