Nice legs, Daisy Dukes,
Makes a man go...
That's the way they all come through like...
Low-cut, see-through shirts that make ya...
That's the way she come through like...

'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up to knock them down,
'Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them to knock them down them down

I think I should know how
to make love to something innocent
without leaving my fingerprints out,
Now, L-o-v-e's just another word
