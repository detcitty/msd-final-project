Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be than with me-ee, uh
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
Ahaaw, I love to love you, baby
