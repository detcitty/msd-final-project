Hey yo Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper

And let that real shit provoke

So you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about playin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre, motherfuck Snoop, motherfuck Death Row
Yo, and here comes my left blow
Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid you found a pup and now you're dapper
But tell me where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper
Talkin' bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
Damn E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his old album cover he was a she-thang
So nigga please, nigga please, don't step to deez
Motherfuckin' real G's
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless

Yo Dre, what's up
Boy you should have known by now

Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
