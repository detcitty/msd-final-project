Are you listenin'?
Hear me talk, hear me sing
Open up the door
Easy less, easy more
When tell me to beware
Are you here, are you there?
Is there something I should know?
Easy come, easy go
Noddin your head Don't hear a word I say.
I can't communicate. when you wait.
Don't relate.
I try to talk to you
But you never even knew
So.what's it gonna be? Tell me.
Can you hear me? (hear me? can you hear?)

I'm so sick of it.
Your attention deficit.
Never listen
never listen
I'm so sick of it
so i'll throw another fit
Never listen
