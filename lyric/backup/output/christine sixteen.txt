She's got me dizzy
She sees me through to the end
She's got me in her hands
And there's no use in pretending

Christine, sixteen
Christine, sixteen

She drives me crazy
I want to give her all I've got
And she's hot every day and night
There is no doubt about it

I don't usually say things like this to girls your age
(Christine, sixteen)
But when I saw you coming out of the school that day
That day I knew, I knew, I've got to have you, I've got to have you
(Christine, sixteen)

She's been around
But she's young and clean
