Baby it just took one look at you
For me to change my one drink order to two
Like we already knew each other
Like we've been talking all night
About a minute into our first dance
We got blindsided by your friends
All in a hurry like you had to go
Didn't they know, you can't leave someone
Girl you can't leave someone

In the middle of a Dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
