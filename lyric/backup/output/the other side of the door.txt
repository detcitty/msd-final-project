In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying trying to make me stay
I said this time I've had enough
And you've called a hundred times but I'm not pickin' up
'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles, screaming I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pourin' rain, come back for more!
And don't you leave 'cause I know all I need is on
