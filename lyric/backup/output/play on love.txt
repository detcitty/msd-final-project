Now when you open your mouth, what comes out
What's the first word, what's the first line?
When you open your mouth and love comes out
Then you know, you just sang the clear line
I've heard people say it a thousand times
In a thousand different ways
I've heard people play it a thousand times
And they know, they know that's the only way
To play.

You got to
Play on love
Play on love
Play on love
Play on love.
