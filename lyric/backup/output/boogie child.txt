Boogie, ah, you sexy, sexy (boogie child)
Boogie, the situation wrecks me
Boogie, I can't stand the way you do it (boogie child)
Boogie, bad girl don't put me through it
Boogie, right to the limit (boogie child)
Boogie, you're a bad girl you got me in it
Boogie, a man could die for the way I'm thinking (boogie child)
Boogie, and I'm in too deep and I just keep sinking

When you move it like you really know how to move me
