The wind is in from africa
last night i couldn't sleep
oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here carey
but it's really not my home
my fingernails are filthy, i got beach tar on my feet
and i miss my clean white linen and my fancy french cologne
Oh carey get out your cane
and i'll put on some silver
oh you're a mean old daddy, but i like you fine
Come on down to the mermaid cafe and i will buy you a bottle of wine
