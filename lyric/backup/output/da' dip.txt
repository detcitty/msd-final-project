This goes out to all the women in the world, especially her
You know it don't even matter your age; it don't even matter your color
Yo, fellas, I ain't forgettin' 'bout y'all
This is for everybody who like to dance
Just listen to what I'm sayin' and do it, and take a chance

I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put your hand upon my hip, when you dip, I dip, we dip
I put my hand upon your hip, when I dip, you dip, we dip
You put yours, and I put mine, and we can dip down low and roll and grind

Just get on the floor like I said befo'
Y'all remember that "Down Low"!

Just put a little dip wit' it
Now roll those hips wit' it
Pop it, push it, rock it, roll it
Can't control it? I'll come hold it
It's all in fun so take a chance
Just get on the floor and do that dance, y'all
I know you like this so, don't try to fight it
Turn around, baby, let me see you from the back
Yeah, I like it like that

Get up now, roll those hips
Drop down, double-up on those dips
