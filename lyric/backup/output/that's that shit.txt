R. Kelly

I pull up, whip low in the Phantom
With the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like
That's that shit

I'm in the back of the club
Blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like
That's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing video style
I'm like

That's that shit
Snoop Dizzle (Hey)
Your boy Kells (Hey)
Let me hear you say

That's that shit

Snoop
Let's get this party jumpin'
Me and Kel gone get it bumpin'

They humpin'
Like when it's over

We gone all get into somethin'
The Dog is fresh
Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest
But these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess
That in the Chi is so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind

But Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test

You fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago
Let me get you to this real west
It's real strong
Real fat and real long
Doggies in the building

Holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it

Something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home
