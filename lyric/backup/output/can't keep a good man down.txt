I can see where I'm going
although the road's not clear,
sometimes it don't seem so, but I know:
you can't keep a good man down!

I buy the paper nearly every day, but I-
ain't got time to read it, you know-
ain't no jobs for me in there now anyway but I know-
you can't keep a good man down!

You can't keep a good man down
