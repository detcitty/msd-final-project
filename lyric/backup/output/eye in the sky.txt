Don't think sorry's easily said
Don't try, turnin' tables instead
You've taken lots of chances before
But I ain't gonna give anymore

Don't ask me
That's how it goes
'Cause part of me knows what you're thinkin'

Don't say words you're gonna regret
Don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take any more

Believe me
The sun in your eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing

I am the eye in the sky, looking at you
I can read your mind
