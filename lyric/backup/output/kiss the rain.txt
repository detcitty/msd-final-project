Hello...
Can you hear me
Am I getting through to you

Hello...
Is it late there
there laughter on the line
Are you sure you're there alone

'cause I'm
trying to explain
something's wrong
You just don't sound the same

Why don't you
Why don't you
Go outside
Go outside

Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long
