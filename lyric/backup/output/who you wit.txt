Uh-huh, yeah hah
Never sprung huh?
Jigga, Roc-a-Fella y'all
Never sprung huh?
Yeah, peep the repertoire
Peoples, feel me on this one
Peoples, feel this
Never sprung huh? Know my style

I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches
Rough bitches, don't matter you my bitches
Gold diggers witcha eyes on my riches
Can't knock your hustle for real, exotic bitches
I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum French
Frames with the French name in the same night
Pull you and your tight friend
Lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in

You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U.S.S.R.
Sexin' in a Lexus car
Match wits with the best of y'all the rest of y'all
Is like vegetables in my presence, check it
Reminescin' to nuttin' you ever heard, Iceberg
Slim baby ride rims through the suburbs
Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred
Get money like I'm down south, Wednesday the 3rd, it's on

Dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
