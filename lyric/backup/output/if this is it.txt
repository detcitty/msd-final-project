I've been phoning
Night and morning
I heard you say
"Tell him I'm not home."

Now you're confessing
But I'm still guessing
I've been your fool
For so, so long

Girl don't lie
Just to save my feelings
Girl don't cry
And tell me nothing's wrong

Girl don't try
To make up phony reasons
I'd rather leave
Than never believe

If this is it
Please let me know
If this ain't love
You'd better let me go
