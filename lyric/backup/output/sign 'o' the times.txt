Oh yeah
In france a skinny man
Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys
And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called the disciples
High on crack, totin a machine gun

Time, time

Hurricane annie ripped the ceiling of a church
And killed everyone inside
