I couldn't wait to turn sixteen
And drive all the boys around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel
Was all I could think about

A little rust in the bed of that truck
And a four speed on the floor
Five hundred dollars it was mine, all mine
And I never wanted nothing more

I took Katie down by the river
With a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool tryin' to play it cool
Hopin' she'd let me cross the line

And I was prayin' that she couldn't tell
