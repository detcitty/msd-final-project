Little somethin' for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corinne

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then, the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare

Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uhh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block, brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up

Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'cause sista you don't need him

And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy, (what's that)
When brothas make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy

And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?

I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
