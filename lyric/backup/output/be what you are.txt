Oh man, you heard enough
Trying to live a risking life
Don't go out and buy a Cadillac
If you know your money ain't right

Fun is so much easier
When within your mean
If you can't afford caviar
Don't be ashamed to eat pork and beef, yeah

I'm not trying to tell you how to do it
I'm only saying put some thought into it

Be what you are, my friend
And live the life
Be what you are, my friend
And live the life

Just because you made this child
Attend some private school
You try to send yours
