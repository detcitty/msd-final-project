I confess, I messed up.
Dropping "I'm sorry" like you're still around.
And I know you dressed up.
"Hey kid, you'll never live this down."

'Cause you're just the girl all the boys want to dance with.
And I'm just the boy who's had too many chances.

I'm sleeping on your folk's porch again, dreaming.
She said, she said, she said, "Why don't you just drop dead?"
