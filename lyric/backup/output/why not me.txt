WHY NOT ME
Fred Knoblock


I'll take another wedding in stride
Here's another June wedding
I'm sittin' on the bride's side... again
Why do they always have to play that song?
You know the one
It's funny, but we never get to sing along

Her daddy's got her by one arm
I used to have her by the other
At least until she found another lover and then another
