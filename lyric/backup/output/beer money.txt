When the lights go down
When you're stuck here in this town
With nowhere to go
So you escape through the radio
And you worked all week
To barely make ends meet

Well, I gotta a little cash burning holes in my pocket
Foot on the gas, taking off like a rocket

So come on, come on,
Baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
