I hear you just got married
Took a month long honeymoon
and you were all smiles at the wedding
and you cried when you kissed the groom
I got no invitation
I guess the mail man didnt bring it to me
but I see the whole thing in slow motion every night as i try to sleep
my buddy john said you looked real pretty
and you acted like you were in love
He said the preacher asked for objections
and he thought about standing up
I told John he must have been crazy
cuz you were just about to say I DO
He Just gave me a wink and said all he could think
