Ohh, whoa (whoa)

You are fine, you are sweet
But I'm still a bit na√Øve, with my heart
When you're close, I don't breathe
I can't find the words to speak
I feel sparks
But I don't wanna be into you
If you're not looking for true love, oh whoa
No, I don't wanna start seeing you
If I can't be your only one

So tell me when it's not alright?
When it's not ok?
Will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright? (say alright)
Will you say OK? (Say OK)
