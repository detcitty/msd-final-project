Good morning! Today's Forecast calls for Blue Skies!
Sun is shining in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped raining
Everybody's in the place
And don't you know, it's a beautiful new day
Hey hey hey!

Running down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city
All the streets where once was pity
Mr Blue. Sky is living in today!
Hey hey hey!

Mr Blue Sky
Please tell us why
