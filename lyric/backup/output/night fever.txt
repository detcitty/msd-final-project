Listen to the ground
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it

On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
It's somethin' we can't share
We can steal it

And that sweet city woman
She moved through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me, yeah
And the feelin' is right

Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
