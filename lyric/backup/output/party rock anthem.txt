Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
We just wanna see ya shake that

In the club party rock, ya lookin' for ya girl? She on me
Nonstop when we in the spot, yo i'm runnin' through these girls booty movin' weight like she on the block
Where the drank? I gots to know, tight jeans, tattoo 'cause I'm rock 'n' roll
Half black, half white, domino, game the money, op-a-doe

Yo, I'm runnin' through these ho's like Drano
I got that devilish flow, rock 'n' roll, no halo
