Como puede ser verdad

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday not far away

Tropical (ah-ah) the island breeze
All of nature (ah-ah-ah-ah) wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when (ah-ah) the samba played
The sun (ah-ah-ah-ah) would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea he called to me
Te dijo te amo
