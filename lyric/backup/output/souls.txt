It all started here, she was a girl from the Midwest
He was a stranger in a strange land, same old story
He came for the glory
She came looking for a young man's hand

But they found bright lights, endless nights
And men just used her innocent ways
He found it all so pretty, hypnotized by the city
They lost sight of the reason, they lost count of the days

And they were two souls searching for each other
One spirit looking for the other
Caught between a hard
Hard place and a rock

Two souls searching for heaven
