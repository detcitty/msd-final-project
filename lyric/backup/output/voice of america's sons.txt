You better wake up, little Johnny
Better wake up real
soon
The time has come now
For me and you

Spent
those years dreaming
But the dreams didn't
last
Time is moving much too fast
Turn the radio
on

Well they built those factories
With blood,
sweat and steel
Coming down fast under
The weight of the
wheel

Hey, little Johnny
There ain't no room
