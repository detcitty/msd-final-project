Brr, I look up
So many
(On my don shit)
So, so many
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

I done made sacrifices, so many sacrifices
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain't free
Fuck it I sacrificed it
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices
And if it's real, real love then you make sacrifices
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices
Fuck it though that's how hungry my appetite is

Fuck what you telling me, I sense the jealousy
I got telepathy, I got the recipe
I got the streets and I don't got no felonies
Forward thinking yeah my mind is ahead of me
Momma said it's gonna be whatever you let it be
It's some homies I grew up with that's dead to me
It's some niggas that I just met in debt to me
What's in common is they both pay respect to me
I get it my way from Friday to Friday
My girl is a mix of Aaliyah and Sade
I came a long way from that Marvin Gaye and chardonnay
I pull out the driveway like I'm in a car chase, speeding
And if my bitch cheat she know I'm leaving
No text no call, boy that bitch airplane mode code
No peacoat no time to change clothes, same clothes
Love if you living by the same code, G code, leave ho
Fuck it you dead to me, back to my destiny
Penthouse, birds eye view that's a nest for me
I got myself out of debt
