(Andy Pratt)

They ran through hills and forest
As two under a spell
He was a city boy Floyd the outlaw
And she thought she new him well.

Long after that great summer
When she first came into her fame
And the avenger from Oklahoma
Was added to her name
The avenger she became.

Well they call her avenging Annie
The avenger of womanhood
She spends her whole life telling lies
These on a mess and over good
She'll take all these spoilt young hippies
Running around playing games
They're surrounding your bed, she'll blow your head
