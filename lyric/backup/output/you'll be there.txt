Hope is an anchor and love is a ship, time is the ocean and life is a trip
You don't know where you're going, â€˜till you know where you're at
And if you can't read the stars, well you better have a map
A compass and a conscience, so you don't get lost at sea
Or on some lonely island, where no one wants to be

From the beginning of creation, I think our maker had a plan
For us to leave these shores and sail beyond the sand
And let the good light guide us through the waves and the wind
To the beaches in a world where we have never been
And we'll climb up on a mountain, y'all we'll let our voices ring
Those who've never tried it, they'll be the first to sing
