(Tone Loc)
Attention all ladies
The Candyman is on the prowl
And for those that wanna get busy
You gots to speak up now

(Candyman)
This rhyme, this time
Is one of a kind, blowing yo mind
Like only the Candyman can
Like a heavyweight champion
Knockin'em out, another bout without a doubt
Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill
(Candyman telling'em the truth)
Will still end up knockin the boots

Ooh boy I love you so
