Why does it hurt so bad?
Why do I feel so sad?
Thought I was over you
But I keep crying when I don't love you

So, why does it hurt so bad?
I thought I had let you go
So, why does it hurt me so?
I gotta get you outta my head
It hurts so bad, oh, it hurts so bad, babe

My life's been better since the day I left you boy
I must admit life's been kind to me
I went and did the things I said, "I would do, boy"
I found someone who loves me for me, yeah yeah

Haven't had much drama since the day that we split, boy
My heart's never been more at ease
And when I think of all the things you put me through
Leaving you has been the best thing for me

So why does it hurt so bad?
Why do I feel so sad?
I thought I was over you
But I keep crying when I don't love you

So, why does it hurt so bad?
