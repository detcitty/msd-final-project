He is my King, He is my one
Yes he's my father, Yes he's my son
I can talk to him, cuz he understands
Everything I go through and everything I am
That's my support system, I can't live without him
The best thing since sliced bread,
Is his kiss, his hugs, his lips, his touch
And I just want the whole world to know, about my..

Black Brotha, I love ya, 
I will never - try to hurt ya
I want ya, to know that, 
I'm here for you, forever true
Black Brotha, strong brotha, 
there is no - one above ya
I want ya, to know that, 
I'm here for you, forever true
