Baby, the place is rockin'
It's a disco night
Baby, the place is rockin'
It's a disco night

It's gonna be one on one
Let everybody know
We gonna be havin' fun
Gettin' down all night I know

Everybody's dancin'
Dancin' to the music
Lookin' for some action
Tryin' to find a new thing

But I know what's happenin', baby
I've been lookin' for you, yeah
I wanna give you somethin'
That you just can't lose

Hey, baby, the place is rockin'
It's a disco night
Baby, we're gonna be thumpin'
It's a disco night

We gonna be all night long
Let everybody know
It's gonna be one on one
Gettin' down at the disco

Ooh, baby
Rock on, girl
Ooh, baby
Rock on, baby

Ooh, baby, the place is rockin'
