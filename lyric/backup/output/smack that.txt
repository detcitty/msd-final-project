Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, 'cause she be that lady, hey!

I feel you creeping, I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh

Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the â€ lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardobe intact now

I feel it, don and crack now
Ooh I see it, don't let back now
I'ma call her then I put the mack down
Money? No problem, pocket full of that now
