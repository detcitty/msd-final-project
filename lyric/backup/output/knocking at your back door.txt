Sweet Lucy was a dancer
But none of us would chance her
Because she was a samurai
She made electric shadows
Beyond our fingertips
And none of us could reach that high

She came on like a teaser
I had to touch and please her
Enjoy a little paradise
The lock was in my pocket
When Lucy met the rocket
She never knew the reason why

I can't deny it
With that smile on her face
Oh it's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase

Feel it coming
