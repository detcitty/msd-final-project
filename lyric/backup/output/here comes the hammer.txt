Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Here comes the hammer
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Here comes the hammer

Yes this is a mission
that I'm on taking out the weak
on the microphone
cause I'm hype so don't talk
about the hard hitting hammer
when you can't even
walk on the stage after me
and if you do you're a catastrophe
happens just like that
I rock em all from white to black

OH OH OH Punch it

Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Here comes the hammer
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Here comes the hammer

Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh Oh-oh oh-oh oh oh

naw no is what I say
when I came to see a show
I look and it's dead dead you know
like a body in the ground
Will your show ever grow
let me know if not the gloves come off
cause you sure ain't hot
it needs work like a car in a wreck
they call me hammer yeah earn my respect
