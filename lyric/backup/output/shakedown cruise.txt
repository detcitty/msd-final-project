It was thirty days around the horn
The captain says it's a thirty-five more
The moon looks mean and the crew ain't staying
There's gonna be some blood
Is what they're all saying

It's a shakedown cruise
And I was just another tool
There ain't no easy way out
They're gonna shake you 'til you shout

They treat you like a dog
But you're only human
You miss your home Lord,
