Don't send me no postcards
Don't send me no letter
No, no, baby

Ain't nothing you
Can do now, girl, no
That'll make things any better
What I'm trying to say is

Baby, if you can't come yourself
No, no, girl, oh, yeah
If you can't come yourself
No, girl, don't send nobody else
No, baby, come yourself, yeah

While you're out there
Having your fun, baby
Don't forget about number one, yeah
