Given any day there's a jet flyin somewhere
Ah, she bought a ticket and she vanished in the sky
And how was I to know she was leavin in the mornin
I never heard her go, she never said goodbye
I learned to love the light, cause the lights gonna get ya
Right between the eyes, in the mornin like a gun
You're reachin out your hand and she's not there beside ya
Oh, what can I say
