gelled up weaved up

need to get bout' a hustle mission
get up on loot run to beautician
run game until the game is gravy

(bwok bwok) on a stalk stalk for a bootleg
(bwok bwok) pretty walk walk givin out head
ain't a thang eat a chicken wang
got some gold teeth
at da club tryin ta shake that thang
tryin ta get piece
chicken chicken always into some dumb shit
shoulda paid ya light bill

and keep a smart mouth

so pass tha dro-dro and we gone stay kickin
full of that mo mo holla at a chicken

[Chorus]
