Silhouette of a perfect frame
Shadows of your smile will always remain
Beginners love, soon fades away, oh, baby
We go on, I will always

(Long as I live)
Long as I live
You will be my
(My first love)
Oh baby, you and only you

(Long as I live)
Long as I live
You will be my first love
(My first love)
And I choose you again
