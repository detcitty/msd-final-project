Sick tape, volume two!
Believe it!
Hoh! Hoh!
Let me switch up the game

On the flo' I fall back
Step back? cause I might put it on ya
I go deep, so deep then I sleep
So sweep cross the floor
Like a broom with my feet

You don't want me have to show ya
How I hop on the beam, flip it over
What up? I'm tore up, sho nuff
I ain't scared to take it off
(Misdemeanor take it off)

Tipsy and I feel good
(Feel good)
Stop a track put on your woods
Into it, I do it, I dud it
If you really, really want it
Then playas stop frontin'
(Stop frontin')

Hey boy you know I'm your type
(Your type)
5'2 and wear my jeans real tight
My curves they swerve so superb
My word is my word and I came to serve

Cause we what?
We run this
What?
