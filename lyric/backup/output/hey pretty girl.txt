Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way?
Love's in the air tonight
Bet you could make this ol' boy stay
Hey pretty girl, won't you look my way?

Hey pretty girl, can I have this dance?
And the next one after that
Gonna make your mind there's a real good chance
Hey pretty girl, can I have this chance?

Hey pretty girl, it feels so right
