Easy now no need fi(as in for) go down,
easy now no need fi go down,
rock that run that, this where we from
(repeat 2x)
Whoop Whoop
When you run come around,
Cu(z) I kno ur the talk of the town yea
(repeat 4x)
Easy now no need fi go down
Just walk it gently and no break nah bone,
Cool end-it-ly, you have a style of your own,
Me never kno you saw ya master the saxsaphone
cause u sound like the talk of the town yea,
imma lock u when u run come around yea,
make me wobble, make me whole body bubble,
