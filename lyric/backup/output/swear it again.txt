I wanna know
Who ever told you I was letting go?
The only joy that I have ever known

Girl, they were lying
Just look around
And all of the people that we used to know

Just gave it up, they wanna let it go

But we're still trying
So, you should know this love we shared was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one way street, just you and I
Just you and I
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I
