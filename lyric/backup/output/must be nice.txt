Ayo you
You that just flipped on this CD player
I just wanna inform you that
When you got somebody good

You hold on to em'
Mmm...
Must be nice
Having someone who understands

The life you live
Must be nice
Having someone who's slow to take
And quick to give

Must be nice
Having someone who sticks around
When the rough times get thick
Someone who's smile is bright enough

To make the projects feel like a mansion
