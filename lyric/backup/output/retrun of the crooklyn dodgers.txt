Straight from Crooklyn
Better known as Brooklyn
Never taking shorts
Cause Brooklyn's the borough

We did it like that
And now we do it like this
We did it like that
And now we do it like this

Heh heh heh, yeah

Now clock, kids
Who got the cocaine
Don't tell me it's the
Little kids on Soul Train

The meta-force it
I put my brain to my jaw
It comes from other places
Not the tinted faces

Journalistic values are yellow
And then of course falters
You watch Channel Zero
With that bitch Barbara Walters

She'll have you believe
Black invented crack
When President Lyndon
Had the formula way back

In sixty-three with Kennedy
Yes, the double cross
Remember that's when they
Blew his fucking head off

Vietnam vets come back
Looking like one-armed pests
Nixon bombs, here attached

No picket fence, no job
No Hazel in the car
Blue collar turns to bourgeoise

Depressed in your chest
Demarol for sess
Low dough, crack in veils
Much less

White, he can sell
On the corners of Bushwick
White, he can sell
On the corners of Flatbush
Whiteys can sell
On the corners of Bed-Stuy
Pass the torch to that nigga guy
