Yeah, Sha-dy, Aftermath - G-Unit!

Damn baby all I need is a lil' bit
A lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Get it crackin in the club when you hear the shit
Drop it like it's hot, get to whippin that back
Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up, and, down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round

I step up in the club I'm like "Who you wit?"
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin to beef, I'm tryin to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'mma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'mma get in shorty ear and I'mma let her know
