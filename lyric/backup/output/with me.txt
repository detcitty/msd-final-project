Sometimes I feel just like a fly in a soup bowl
Sometimes I feel like I'm on top of a heap
Sometimes I feel like I'm the king of the castle
Sometimes I feel like just a bump on a street

I got my highs and lows
Some days it's touch and go
But baby, this I know

When you're with me, I feel like singing
