A good song and a love affair
Go hand in hand together
When you think you've gotten over one
The other holds on to your forever

I've tried hard to forget (To forget love)
Ever lovin' you
But just when I've convinced myself
It's over with, then I hear

That old song that they used to play (That old song)
On the radio just about every day
And whenever I hear it all I can do
Is reminisce about lovin' you

That old song that they still play (That old song)
