Just out of spite,
I confess I've ruined three lives
Now don't sleep so tight
Because I didn't care till I found out
that one of them was mine.

Night after night time time after time.
Done too much of both types of w(h)ining.
Still wasn't right fight after fight
Till "Get out of my life get away from me
get away from that gun"

"No it's not a joke it's cards on the table time
Yes I could have phoned
I could have wrote
But how to break the news
without beaking your heart
Being dead don't hurt,
No only dieing
Cards on the table time,
Sometimes it's right to say goodnight."
