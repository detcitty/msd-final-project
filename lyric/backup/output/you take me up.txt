I work on the front line
I work to survive
I sleep in a fever
So this is my life

I cry in my sleep (Cry boy, Cry boy)
Just makes me weep when I try, how I try
Know what it means to work hard on machines
It's a labour of love so please don't ask me why

Working for reason (Day in, Day out)
Trying to hard (He's trying too hard)
Moving in circles (Too hot, Too hot)
Don't get very far (Don't get very far)
