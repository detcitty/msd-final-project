Break 'em
Just wakin' up in the mornin' gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog

And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog

I got my grub on, but didn't pig out

Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'
Thinkin' will I live another twenty-fo'
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
