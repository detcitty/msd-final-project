Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screaming that's nothing
What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting
Repping my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow

I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow
Black stripe, yellow paint, them niggas scared of it but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club look at them hoes face
Hit the pedal once make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roaring
It's the big boy, you know what I payed for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
I got you niggas checking game I'm balling out on every level
Hear them haters talk but there's nothing you can tell 'em
