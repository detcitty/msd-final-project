The second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peeking through the shades
I can't help but laugh cause I kind of like feeling this way

I woke up, up still drunk, drunk
On your love, love, on your love, love
