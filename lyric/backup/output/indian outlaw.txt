I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and choctaw
My baby she's a Chippawa
She's a one of a kind

All my friends call me Bear claw
Village chieftain is my paw paw
He gets his orders from my maw maw
She makes him walk the line

You can find me in my Wigwam
I'll be beatin' on my tom tom
Pull out the pipe and smoke ya some
Hey, and pass it around
