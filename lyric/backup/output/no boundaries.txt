Seconds, hours, so many days
You know what you want, but how long can you wait
Every moment lasts forever when you feel you've lost your way
What if my chances are already gone
Started believing that I could be wrong
But you give me one good reason
To fight and never walk away

So here I am â€” still holding on!

With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing

Just when you think the road is going nowhere
