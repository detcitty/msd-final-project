Baby, I know you are hurting
Right now you feel like you could never love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you

From the first day that I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would be together forever
Ooh, when I asked you out, you said, "No"
But I found out darling that you'd been hurt
You felt that you'd never love again

I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey, he's nothing like me
