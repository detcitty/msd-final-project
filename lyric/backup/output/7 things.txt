I probably shouldn't say this but at times I get so scared

When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome but we lost it it's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain but nothing's ever gonna change until you hear my dear
The 7 things I hate about you

The 7 things I hate about you oh you
You're vain your games you're insecure you love me you like her
