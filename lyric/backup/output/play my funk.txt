Chorus x2
Now everybody wanna play my funk
Now everybody wanna play my funk
Now everybody wanna play my funk
Now everybody knows me

I was walkin on the railroad
I sat my booty on the track
I saw this kid with the gap sack
So i snatched my booty back
I said looka here, partner
You know you can't be me
I be the one, it ain't two now
And you know it's true

Now move on
I got the fellas jealous cause i flows like none
I got the whole nine, need not pack a gun
