Well a man come on 6 o'clock news
Said, "Somebody been shot, somebody's been abused
Somebody blew up a building, somebody stole a car
Somebody got away, somebody didn't get too far"
Yeah, they didn't get too far

Grand pappy told my pappy back in my day son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he'd done
Take all the rope in Texas find a tall oak tree
