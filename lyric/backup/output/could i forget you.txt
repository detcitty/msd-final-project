Oh, I guess this is the end of the line
My mind is completely made up
Oh, because only a fool would say
Knowing one day he might get hurt

But even when things for me
Was looking bad
Girl, I held my head up high

And then I asked myself
(Then I asked myself)
And then I asked myself
(Then I asked myself)
