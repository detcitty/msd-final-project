To all the girls I've loved before,
Who traveled in and out my door
I'm glad they came along,
I dedicate this song
To all the girls I've loved before

To all the girls I once caressed,
And may I say, I've held the best,
For helping me to grow, I owe a lot, I know,
To all the girls I've loved before
