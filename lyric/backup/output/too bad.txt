Fathers hands were lined with dirt
From long days in the field

And mothers hands are serving meals
In a cafe on Main Street
With mouths to feed, just trying to keep
Clothing on our backs
And all I hear about is
How it's so bad, it's so bad
It's too bad, stupid

Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that
We had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

(Let's talk)
