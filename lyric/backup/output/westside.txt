This is going out, to the whole wide westside...
Know what I'm sayin?
Break it down for me.
Steadily mobbin,
rock rock on.

I was just the young boy,
Living in the hove city.
East Side Compton G
Back in the days when Ice Cube and Eazy
Had every nigga talkin bout
Boy you can't fuck with me
Remember Ice-T had the power
hearing gunshots licking by the hour.
When Too short bumping every super spot
And told us all how to ride for the West Coast

To my peoples if you with me where you at
Throw your dubs in the air,
and wave 'em like you just don't care
From L.A. to the Bay, what you say, all day every day any damn day
Take a look around, we got the whole world locked down, going on an on
It don't stop, won't stop, can't stop, nigga ride or die.
That's why I put it down for the West side

Didn't seem that long ago, (oh no)
We was stealing 40s out the liquor sto (oh no)
Mama started tripping so it's time to go
