Walk around (Shake)
Not havin’ fun (Shake)
I’m mavin’ hard times y’all (Shake)
But I make the run (Shake)

Gotta go to work (Shake)
Each and every day (Shake)
Hardly no money (Shake)
Comin’ my way (Shake)

Ain’t got no car (Shake)
Gotta ride the bus (Shake)
All the way home, y’all (Shake)
Gotta listen to Gus fuss (Shake)

Rent is due (Shake)
But my loan didn’t come through (Shake)
Got me a couple of dollars (Shake)
Guess what I’m gonna do (Shake)

Shake, shake, shake, shake my booty
At the disco, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
