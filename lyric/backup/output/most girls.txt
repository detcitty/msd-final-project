I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush
That I just did not want.

Paid was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game.
Couldn't be more fly
Gettin' paid was everything.

But I'm not every girl.
And I don't need that world
To validate me.

'Cause shorty got a job
Shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent.
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart...

Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling
Got my own thing
Got the ching-ching.
I just want real love...

Most girls want a man
With the mean green
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love.
(A-ha, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha. Ah... ah.)

Uh...
