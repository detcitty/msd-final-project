Dancing, romancing
But no second chancing
Nothing more
Running and hiding
Slipping and sliding
Across the floor

She comes alone every night
On her own looking for romance
She stands there watching
While everyone's touching
She'd take a chance
Standing there waiting, anticipating

How could this go wrong
So many lovers holding on
How could this go wrong
Another night goes on and on
