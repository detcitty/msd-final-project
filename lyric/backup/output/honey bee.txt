Girl I been thinkin' 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
But these feelings piling up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me
But I'll do my best

You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee
