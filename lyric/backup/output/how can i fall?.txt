Give me time to care
The moment's here for us to share
Still my heart is not always there
What more can I say to you?

Could I lie to you?
I'm just too weak to face the truth
Now I know, I should make a move
What more can I say?

How can I fall? How can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons at all

When all faith is gone
