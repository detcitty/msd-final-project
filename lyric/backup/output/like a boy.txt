C-I-A-R-A

Pull up your pants (Just Like Em')
Take out the trash (Just Like Em')
Getting ya cash like em'
Fast like em'
Girl you outta act like ya dig
(What I'm talkin' bout')
Security codes on everything
On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring
(Joint Account)
And another one he don't know about

Wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that
Tell you I love you
But when you call I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me?
Like where you be at?
Cause I'm out 4 in the morning
On the corner rolling
Doing my own thing
Oh

What if I
Had a thing on the side
Made ya cry?
Would the rules change up
Or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Can't be getting mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!
Can't be getting mad!
What you mad?
Can't handle that!

Girl go head and be (Just Like Em')
Go run the streets (Just Like Em')
