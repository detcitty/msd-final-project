"Wrecking balls, downtown construction
Bottles breaking, jukebox buzzing
Cardboard sign says â€˜The Lord is coming'
Tick tick tock

Rumors turn the mills back home /
Parking lot kids with the speakers blown
We didn't turn it on,
but we can't turn it off off off

Sometimes I wonder how did we get here
Seems like all we ever hear is

Noise,
