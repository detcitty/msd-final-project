Oh my god, I love this song
This is my jam
Where is my peanut butter?

2 PM, getting out of my bed
Trying to get Friday out of my head
It's all so hazy
Got a little too crazy
You know I'd do it all again

Call everyone you know
Turn up the radio
Cause this is our song
We can do no wrong
Are you ready, are you ready to go?

This Saturday we're gonna party all night
