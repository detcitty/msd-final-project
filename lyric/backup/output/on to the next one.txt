I got a million ways to get it, choose one
Bring it back, bring it back
Now double your money and make a stack

I'm on to the next one, on to the next
I'm on to the next one, on to the next
I'm on to the next one, on to the next
I'm on to the next one, on to the next

Hold up, freeze, hey
Somebody bring me back some money please, hey

Hov' on that new shit, niggaz like, "How come?"
Niggas want my old shit, buy my old album
Niggas stuck on stupid, I gotta keep it movin'
Niggas make the same shit, me I make "The Blueprints"

Came in the Range, hopped out that Lexus
Every year since, I been on that next shit
Traded in the gold for the platinum Rolex's
Now a nigga wrist match the status of my records

Used to rock a throwback, ballin' on the corner
Now I rock a Teller suit, lookin' like a owner
No I'm not a Jonas Brother, I'm a grown up
No I'm not a virgin, I use my cojones

I move onward, the only direction
Can't be scared to fail, searchin' perfection
Gotta keep it fresh, girl, even when we sexin'
But don't be mad at him when he's on to the next one

Freeze, hey
Somebody bring me back some money please, hey
