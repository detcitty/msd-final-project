24, 34, 46, good and thick
And once you get it she'll work wit it
Pretty face and some cute lips, earing in her tongue
And she know what to do wit it

Make a name for herself and she do her shit well
And know how to keep her business to herself
Come over anytime a nigga call chick
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock and she right there
(Ding dong)

And she know why she came here
And she know where her clothes suppose to be
(Off and over there)
Sniff a little coke, take a little X, smoke a little weed

Drink a little bit., I need a girl that I can freak wit
And wanna try shit, and ain't scared of a big dick
And love to get her pussy licked
By another bitch 'cause I ain't drunk enough to do that
