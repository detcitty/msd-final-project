A million miles away
Your signal in the distance
To whom it may concern

I think I lost my way
Getting good at starting over
Every time that I return

I'm learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?

I'm learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
...
Do you remember the days
We built these paper mountains
Then sat and watched them burn
