You should have treated me right
But you left me lonely and cold at night.
Since you won't, someone will
Treat me better and be for real.

If you didn't want it you shoulda let me know
But since you didn't want it, then girl you got to go.
You left me sad and lonely, and ran away from home
So since I'm not your only, then go and fetch your bone.

Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, ooh, you're a dirty, dirty,
Dawg, dirty dawg, dawg, dirty dawg,
Dawg, oh, you're sow damn dirty.
