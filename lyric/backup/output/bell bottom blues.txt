Bell bottom blues, you made me cry
I don't want to lose this feeling
If I could choose a place to die
It would be in your arms

Do you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?
Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?
I'd gladly do it because
I don't want to fade away
Give me one more day, please
I don't want to fade away
In your heart I want to stay

It's all wrong but it's alright
The way that you treat me, baby
