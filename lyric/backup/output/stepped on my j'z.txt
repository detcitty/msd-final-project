Uh, ooh, uh
Y'all know what this is

We used to ditch school and head straight up to the mall
Just so we could be the first ones with â€ em on
Return to school by lunch time, like nigga, "What now?"
But today we in the club, like nigga, "What now?"

You better look down â€ cause I
I know you see â€ em, say what?
I know you see â€ em, say what? I know you see â€ em
A thousand for the jeans, two hundred for the shoes
And uh, fuck a shirt I'ma rock these tattoos

You see my fitted man, I represent the crib
â€ Cause even at the crib, I represent the crib
Might pop my grill in, might let my chain hang
Might wrap my wrist
(Down dirty, do the damn thing)

I get â€ em free, say what? But I payin'
If I want I rock a different year o' J'z e'ery day
A different style, different color is a must
But uh, it's all good until I get my first scuff
And I'm like

Hell naw, ain't no way!
(What's wrong?!)
Man, he just stepped on my J'z!
(What?!)
Stepped on my J'z! He done stepped on my J'z!
These just came out! He done stepped on my J'z!

Hell naw, ain't no way!
(What's wrong?!)
Man, he just stepped on my J'z!
(What?!)
