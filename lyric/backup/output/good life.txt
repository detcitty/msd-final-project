Let me take you to a place I know you want to go
it's a good life

I wanna stand around and beg you
just don't say no
no no
no no.
I have got a feeling that you're gonna like it

what I'm doing to you
And I know what I'm doing

I'll be doing what you want to me to do.
Love is shining
life is thriving in the good life

good life
Good life
good life
good life

good life
in the good life
