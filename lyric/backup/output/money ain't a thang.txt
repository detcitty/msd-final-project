Uh uh
So So Def
Yeah, yeah

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard in the double R, flashin' the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to Hell with the price 'cause the money ain't a thang
Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit' us
'Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin' on your pimpin', turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside

Tryin' to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it

Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up

Multi 'til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy, where you at haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
