Like strawberries, you're like my strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me
Like strawberries, you're like my strawberries
Sometimes you're bitter, sometimes you're sweet
I feel the same way about you and me
You're talkin' me through changes
'Cause you know I'll do anything for you
Couldn't stop it if I wanted to
So I never know which way my heart is gonna go
How could someone so good make me feel so bad
Sometimes I wish I never had
