Got my mans that put me on, you know what I'm sayin
Want a shout out to the uptown, know what sayin
Word up

Pretty lou, my man, spigg nice
We be gettin' down representin
So this is how we go
Let me let you know, how
It be, in da, g-h-e, double t-o
Ryhme name ho
They be runnin' shit down the line
Hey, if you hear a mistake rewind

Whose the best whose the worst in this here rap game
For those who claim to be the best
I tear them out the frame
I'm representin' puttin' queens on the map (you wear)
Double springs, wit some baggy jeans when I rap
Come up with a style to make con-versital
