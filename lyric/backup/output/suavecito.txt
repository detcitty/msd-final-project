Never, I never met a girl like you in my life
I never, no, no, yeah, I never met a girl like you in my life
The way that you hold me in the night
The way that you make things go right
Whenever you're in my arms
Girl, you're filling me with all your charms

Suavecito, mi niña
Suavecito, mi niña (The feeling that I have inside)
Suavecito, mi linda
Suavecito
