When I get off of work on Friday
After working like a dog all week
I go to meet the boys for a cold one
At a little joint up the street

They got a jukebox in the corner
Full of old country tunes
Feed it five dollars worth of quarters
Is the first thing I always do

'Cause I need a little twang
A little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings
