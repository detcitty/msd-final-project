Cruisin Down The Street In My Six-Fo"
Jockin The Bitches, Slappin The Hoes
Went To The Park To Get The Scoop
Knuckleheads Out There Cold, Shootin Some Hoops
A Car Pulls Up, Who Can It Be
A Fresh El Camino Rollin Kilo G
He Rolled Down His Window And He Started To Say
Its All About Makin That G.T.A.

Coz The Boys In The Hood Are Always Hard
You Come Talkin That Trash, We'll Pull Ya Card
Knowin' Nutin In Life But To Be Legit'
Dont Quote Me Boy Coz I Aint Said Shit

Yo Man
"Get The Fuck Out"
Pump That Beat
"Muthafucka, Say What"

Down On B's Is The Place To Give Me The Pace
He Said Ma Man J.D. Is On Freebase
The Boy J.D. Was A Friend Of Mine
'till I Caught Him In My Car Tryin To Steal The Alpine
Chased Him Down The Street To Call A Truce
The Silly Muthafucka Pulls Out A Deuce Deuce
Little Did He Know I Had A Loaded 12 Guage
One Sucker Dead, L.A. Times Front Page

Coz The Boys In The Hood Are Always Hard
You Come Talkin That Trash, Well Pull Ya Card
