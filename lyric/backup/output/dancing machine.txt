Dancing, dancing, dancing
She's a dancing machine

Ah baby
Move it baby

Automatic, Systematic
Full of color, self-contained
Tune that channel to your box

Captivating, Stimulating
She's such a sexy lady
Filled with space age design

She's moving, she's grooving
Dancing untill the music stops, now

Yeah

Rhythmatic, acrobatic
She a dynamite attraction
At the drop of a coin she comes alive, yea
She knows what she's doing
She's super bad now
