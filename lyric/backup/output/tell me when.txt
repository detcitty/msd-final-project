Tell me when
Will I?
Tell me when
Will I?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when

Kelly took a lifetime
Searching for the bottom line
I wasn't into searching
'Cause I was doing fine
I wasn't into fighting, chasing
Sweating, slaving, fretting, racing
Any waste of effort
Isn't part of my design
Billy was an inspiration
Positive and kind
Until he let confusion
Overcome his youthful mind
Common sense dictated
I could never be so blind
And then
Then I see you

Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
