You should hear what they're sayin' about you
You should see the way they talk behind my back
They say that you've found another and that you're gonna leave
But you wouldn't do that to me . . .
So

Say it ain't true
The things that they've been saying
They say that you've found
Someone new
But don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
Cos your baby never looked good in blue
Your baby never looked good in blue
