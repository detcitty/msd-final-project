Cold late night, so long ago
When I was not so strong, you know
A pretty man came to me
Never seen eyes so blue

I could not run away
It seemed we'd seen each other in a dream
It seemed like he knew me
He looked right through me
Yea

Come on home, girl
He said with a smile
You don't have to love me yet
Let's get high awhile
But try to understand
Try to understand
Try, try, try to understand
I'm a magic man
