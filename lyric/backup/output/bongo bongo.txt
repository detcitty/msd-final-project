She likes it, she likes it
My baby she likes it
My baby she likes to dance
She loves it, she loves it
My baby she loves it
My baby she loves to dance

Puttin' her rouge on
Slippin' her shoes on
My baby's gettin' ready to dance
It's so calculated and anticipated
When my baby gets ready to dance

I said baby, baby
You were born to dance
I said baby, baby
You were born to dance
