Where can I run to find an escape
I've had a very busy day
I need some fun, some private space
I want to get away

To someplace where
There isn't a care or a worry
But it must be some place near
'Cause I wanna go in a hurry

Do you wanna get away, do wanna escape
I can help you, I'm your lover, oh
Do you wanna get away, my love can take you some place
Where you'll never be discovered (Do you)

I wanna get away, yeah
I wanna get away, yeah
