She'd rather wear a pair of cut-off jeans than a fancy evening dress
And with her windows rolled down
And her hair blown all around
She's a hot southern mess

She'll take a beer over white wine
And a campfire over candlelight
And when it comes to love
Oh, her idea of a romantic night

Is listenin' to old Alabama
Drivin' through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight at the Right Time of the Night
