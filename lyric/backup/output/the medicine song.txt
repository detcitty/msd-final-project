Danger eyes are no surprise
In stayin' wise to you
Shady walks and midnight stalks
Have showed me what to do

Kept my cool, this ain? t no fool
You think you? re messin' with
I know how to keep you? round
? Cause I know where you been

You think that they really want just you
(Better think again, better think again)
I? m the only one knows what to do
? Cause you? ve been bad, baby, oh, so bad, baby
And there? s only one thing can be done

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Just a little touch up)
Mama? s gonna give you some medicine

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Just a little touch up)
Mama? s gonna give you some medicine

Every time I think you? re mine
You? re up to somethin' new
I? ve done almost everythin'
To try to get to you

All my friends are just dead ends
In helpin? me alone
I just keep on wonderin?
What am I doin? wrong
