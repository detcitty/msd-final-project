I came to see her daddy
For a sit down man to man
It wasn't any secret
I'd be asking for her hand

I guess that's why he

me waiting
In the living room by myself
With at least a dozen pictures of her
Sitting on a shelf
She was playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike

Bouncing on the bed
And looking for a pillow fight
