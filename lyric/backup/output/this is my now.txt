This is my wish
My wish for the world
That peace would find his way
To every boy and girl

There was a time, when i was so afraid
I thought I'd reached the end, baby that was then
I am made of more then my yesterdays
This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment

As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
