You're the kind
When you love, you love with all your might and
You're the kind
I would dream about at night
Now I'm the lucky one
Baby I'm the lucky one

You're the kind
That I want to be with in the dark and
You're the kind
Who is capturing my heart
And I'm the lucky one
Baby I'm the lucky one

And I have never been the one to fall in love so soon
