Fish were made to swim in the ocean
And boats were made to sail on the sea
As sure as there's stars above me
I know you were made for me
(You were made for me)

A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple was made to grow on a tree
As sure as there's stars above me
I know you were made for me
(You were made for me)

We'll have our quarrels
And you will upset me
(But what can I do)
But what can I do
