The other side
The other side
The other side of me

By day, I play
The party in every way
Of simple sweet, calm and collected

Pretend, to my friends
I'm a chameleon
Can make a girl feel disconected

Feel like a star
A super hero
Sometimes it's hard to separate
(Got too much on my plate)

If could see
The other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell
I hold the key (the key)
To both realities
The girl that I want you to know
