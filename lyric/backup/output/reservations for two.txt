It's been so long
Since I last saw you
We're always running
No time for loving
Let's take some time out
To know each other again
You know I miss you
You're my best friend

I don't want to lose you
You're the one I'm living for
And I need you here beside me
Can't be without you anymore

[Chorus]
Let's make reservations for two
