One big happy family
Together the rest of our lives
As far as our friends were concerned
Everything seemed right

But that's when she told me
She said me it was time to move on
Just something that she kept inside
That told me the thrill was gone

And now I can't believe
I can't believe it's over
Suddenly it's plain to see
She's leaving me and

Even a fool can see
