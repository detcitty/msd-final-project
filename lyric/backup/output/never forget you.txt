I used to be so happy
But without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's very deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you

And you will always be by my side till the day I die
