(CHORUS)
You are a child of the universe
No less than the trees and the stars
You have a right to be here

Desiderata
Desiderata, Desiderata

Go placidly amid the noise and haste
And remember what peace
There may be in silence

As far as possible without surrender
Be on good terms with all persons
Speak your truth quietly and clearly
And listen to others

Even the dull and ignorant
They too have their story
Avoid loud and aggressive persons
They are vexations to the spirit

If you compare yourself with others
You may become vain and bitter
For always there will be greater
And lesser persons than yourself
