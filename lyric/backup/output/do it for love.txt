Chorus:
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do it for love?

Do you feel the same connection, make it right some way some how
Does it come from your emotions, open up the door a little wider now
Do you try to find the feeling, that should never go away
Can it really be so easy, just to make the feeling stay
