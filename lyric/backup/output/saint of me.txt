Saint Paul the persecutor was a cruel and sinful man
Jesus hit him with a blinding light and then his life began
I said yes
I said yeah

Augustin knew temptation
He loved women, wine and song
And all the special pleasures
of doing something wrong
I said yes
I said yeah

I said yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
You'll never make a saint of me
