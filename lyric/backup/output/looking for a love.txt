Somebody help me
Somebody help me now
Somebody help me now

Somebody help me
Find my baby
Somebody help me
Find my baby right now

I'm looking for a love
I'm looking for a love
I'm looking here and there
I'm searching everywhere
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

Gonna get up in the morning
And rub my head
I'm looking for a love
To call my own

Fix my breakfast
And bring it to my bed
