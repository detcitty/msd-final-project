I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl
Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor?
I don't know how you feel can you tell me
I won't know how you feel 'til you tell me
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy

Is it cause I'm a star
It maybe could be my star status
I got my chain and ring
My Rolex watch it got 50 carats
It could be QC or even maybe it's me
It could be that 4 hour flight, shopping in Beverly
What's on your mind?
I'm not Ginuwine
Ain't tryna spend no time
I know my bitch she so fine
But I don't know what's on her mind
Gotta pay that cost to be a boss
I put on my Louboutins playing golf
