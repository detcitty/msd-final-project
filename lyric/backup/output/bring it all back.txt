Girl you know that this is wrong
Got to go one way or the other
I can't keep turning my love off and on
If we really love each other
I've said enough for both of us
And i'm starving for your touch

Baby bring it on back
Bring your sweet love back to me girl
Baby bring it on back
I'm so lonely, can't you see
