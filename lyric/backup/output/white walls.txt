I wanna be free, I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac, that is my shit
Now throw it up (now throw that up)
That's what it is (that's what it is)
In my C A D I L L A C bitch (bitch)

Can't see me through my tints (nah ah)
I'm riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint wet dripping shining like my 24's (umbrella)
I don't got 24's (nah ah)
But I'm on those Vogues
That's those big white walls
R-r-round them hundred spokes
Old school like old English in that brown paper bag
I'm rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello, haters, damn y'all mad

30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, lean back, taking my time

I'm rollin' out, roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Man I'm lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would've been proud of
