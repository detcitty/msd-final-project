Do it again, do it (Do it)
Let's do it again (Do it)
Mmm (Do it again, do it again)
Gonna do it again (Do it)
Do it, do it
Let's do it again (Do it)
Do it again

Sometimes the rain
Groovin' when I hear the sound
Like you and me, baby
Gettin' down with the sounds around
Oh, the smell of the mornin' flower
As we pass away the hour
I wanna do it again, do it again
Do it again (Do it)

Let's do it in the mornin'
Sweet breeze in the summer time
Feeling your sweet face
All laid up next to mine

Sweet love in the midnight
