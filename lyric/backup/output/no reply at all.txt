Talk to me, you never talk to me.
Ooh, it seems that I can speak.
I can hear my voice shoutin' out.

But there's no reply at all.

Look at me, you never look at me.
Ooh, I've been sittin, starin', seems so long.
But you're lookin' through me
Like I wasn't here at all.

No reply. There's no reply at all.

Dance with me, you never dance with me.
Ooh, it seems that I can move.
