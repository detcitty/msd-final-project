This is... This is
This is... AND HE GOES BY THE NAME OF

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah you got the right one, It's Weezy fuckin baby
And if your woman lookin, I'll let the woman taste me
Okay now I'm with Khaled, we whylin in Miami
We got a bunch of bitches, we pile 'em in the phantom
They follow us to Mansion but I don't mean the club
I'm talking bout my crib, mama I'm trying to fuck
It's Cash Money Baby, It's Young Money Biatch
Now you can swallow that or you can suck a dick
Okay, tell me shit, Lil Wayne fuck a bitch
Lil' nigga, big money, big gun full of that shit
Nigga I ain't Will Smith, nah, I ain't a Fresh Prince
Nigga I'm a young king, nigga I'm a Bun B
Yup, I go hard, ask my broad
Miss Stevie Wonder, she ain't lookin at y'all (She can't see)
The rest goes without me having to say
I say, go, go, go, go (DJ)

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
Holla at me, what it do, what it is
You ain't never seen a playa like this (Holla at me baby)
I'm a pimp, I'll show her how I live
Take her back then I put it in her wrist (Holla at me baby)
I'm a monster, I do it real big
You ain't never seen rocks like this (Holla at me baby)
You can see me from a far I'm the shit
