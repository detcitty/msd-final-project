Konvict, konvict...

I met her on the walk way
Staring as she walked pass
She looked back at me side ways and said
I can't help but to ask

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' something

We end up going back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
We hit it off until the morning
Until you hear her say

Ama ma se,
Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa,
Ma ma coo sa Billie Jean is always talkin'
When nobody else is talkin'
