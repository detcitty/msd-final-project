Ow, yeah
Check me out on the good side here

Well, my baby's on the corner and she's lookin' so fine
Put one and one together and it blowed my mind
Ah, a man needs love to live, I'm the living proof
Catch that smile and I hit the roof

We'd double check but you keep on walkin'
I'm in love
Once over, I'm overdone
