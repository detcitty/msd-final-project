When I met you, oh
You know at first you had me so confused
We used to lay awake at night
Strugglin' with the feelings I so long refused
When I surrendered my love
I saw you turn your heart too cold to ice, darlin'
I put my heart on the line for you
Oh I did, I put my heart on the line, yeah
First you take me to the highest ground
Then you keep me hanging like some village clown

CHORUS:
