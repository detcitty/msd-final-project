See, I learn to keep that mask on
I'mma keep that cash on me
I'mma keep that cash on me
I'mma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya
I'm gon' drop a bag on ya
I'm gon' drop that bag on ya
Don't make me drop that bag on ya
I learn to keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask
Gotta learn to keep that mac on me
Gotta keep that mac on me
Gotta keep that mac on that rap-pap-pap-pap, target

Side (?) old car
Niggas gon' pull up and spray in broad
Got that yapa on him right now
And he ready to pull up right now
Shot up a nigga with the scope
Fuck that pussy shit, we sellin' dope
