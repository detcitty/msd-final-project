(Robin Lerner/Franne Golde/Steve Booker)

Hope, everybody needs hope
Some kind of peace of mind
That they can call their own
And everybody needs love
Just a little trust
'Cause sometimes eatin', sleepin', breathin'
Just ain't enough

As long as the truth is on the table
As long as there's kindness down the line
Like the little babies in the cradle
We'll be fine
