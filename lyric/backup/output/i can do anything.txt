We can do an album
Or we can do a viral
Spread it like a STD you got back in high school
I can run for president
O just run the block
I can be a stoner
Or shit I just forgot

I can be an athlete
I can be a New York cabbie
I can be your boyfriend in the back seat
Pass me a beer or a bottle of gin
Shit! I can be your best friend

I ain't gonna take no shit from no one
I ain't gonna take no lip from no one
You ain't gonna try to get me to hold on
It's golden now
Why would I slow down?

I can do anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything I want
