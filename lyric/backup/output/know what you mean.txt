What do you mean? Oooh
When you nod your head yes

But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Heeey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Oh oh oh What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart.
Don't know if you're happy, or complaining.

Don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
