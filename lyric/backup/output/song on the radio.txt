I was making my way through the wasteland
The road into town passes through
I was changing the radio stations
With my mind on you

Oh, your friends call you 'Lily Paloma'
But that's not the way that you are
It's too much of a gentle misnomer
For a shooting star

But you and me, baby
I saw you there, straight away I knew
There's really no hiding
I tell you right now what we're gonna do

We'll go collecting the days
Putting the moments away

You're on my mind
Like a song on the radio
