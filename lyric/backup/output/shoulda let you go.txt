Just to think about it, I would do things that I would regret
Tryna get you to understand how I felt for you
I tried real hard, time and time again but I
Didn't know our love wouldn't grow, I shoulda just let it go
But I, stayed around thinkin' you would learn to love

And we both know you're wrong
There's nothin' you can do to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you deep in my heart I know you couldn't love me
But baby, I just kept holdin' on, I shoulda let you go

Shoulda let you go
I shoulda let you go
You know I shoulda let you go

Couldn't do without it, I thought I needed you in my world
To get me by, but, more and more I looked out for you
You try and play me like a fool, so I
Didn't care that love wasn't there, had to just let it go
