I hope that I ain't callin too late baby
Hope you ain't closesd those pretty blue eyes
Have you looked out your window lately?
The moon's taken up half of that sky
whoa whoa!
I'm a little bit restless, can't get you off of my mind
oh
I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss, your lips on a night like this
