Oh oh
just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to show me the light
Not just for the meanwhile
for a long long time
Better believe it
Oh oh
whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings
Yeah
So I sleep through the daylight
stay awake all night
'Til you're back again
oh yeah yeah
You think I'm biased
