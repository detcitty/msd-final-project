When you said it was over
You shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Oooh, I was so mad

I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart
Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say "be real" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (funny right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)

One time don't change everything

She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

When you said it was over
