It sure is hot out here, ya know?
I don't mind thought just glad to be great
Know what I'm saying!
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise you ...
I just wanna praise you ...
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise you, I'm gonna praise you!
In the corners of my mind I just can't seem to find a reason to believe
That I can break free, cause you see I have been
Down for so long, feel like the hope is gone, but as I lift my hands,
I understand that I should praise you through my circumstance
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise you ...
I just wanna praise you ...
