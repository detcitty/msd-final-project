Ah-ah, he-ey
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, he-ey
Ah-ah, ah-ah

He knows
Dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killing me?
He knows, he knows

D-d-does he know
Another's hands have touched my skin
I won't tell him where I've been
He knows, he knows, he knows

It's tearing me apart
She's slipping away (I'm slipping away)
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone
She's not coming home (I'm not coming home)
Coming home, coming home

I know what you did last summer (Ah-ah)
Just lied to me, "there's no other" (He-ey)
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
I know what you did last summer (Ah-ah)
Look me in the eyes, my lover (He-ey)
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been

I know (Ah-ah)
(He-ey)
I know (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
