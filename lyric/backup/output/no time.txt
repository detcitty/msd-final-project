I got no time for fake niggaz
Just sip some Cristal with these real niggaz
From East to West coast spread love niggaz
And while you niggaz talk shit we count bank figures

Yeah, I Momma, Miss Ivana
Usually rock the Prada, sometimes Gabbana
Stick you for your cream and your riches
Zsa Zsa Gabor, Demi Moore, Prince Diane and all them rich bitches

Puff Daddy pump the Hummer for the summer
I follow in the E-Class with the goggles
96 models, Bad Click on the stroll
Tell 'em how we roll, cruise control

Nuttin' make a woman feel betta
than Berrettas and Amarettas, butta leathers and mad cheddaz
Chillin' in a Benz with my ami-gos
Tryin' to stick a nigga for his pe-sos

If you say so's, then I'm the same chick
That you wanna get with, lick up in my twat
Gotta hit the spot, if not don't test the poom poom
Nanny nanny, punanny donny, hey

No time for fake niggaz
Just sip some Cristal with these real niggaz
From East to West coast spread love niggaz
And while you niggaz talk shit we count bank figures

I got no time for fake niggaz
