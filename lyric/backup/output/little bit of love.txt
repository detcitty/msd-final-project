Used to say it was a passing thing
Didn't mean anything, but we wrong
We used to play it was a harmless touch
It didn't mean that much and we'd be gone

There's a little bit of love going on here
Slipping through the window, scratching at the door

I used to think you were sweet and coy
But like a broken toy you'd be around
