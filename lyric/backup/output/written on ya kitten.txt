Miscellaneous
Thug By Nature
(L-Burna)
I'm callin' my shots just how I see it, believe it
My nigga, I G it
Got a few things that's on my mind
So nigga gon' listen up while I free it
Whatever's needed, I'ma get it
And if I wanna get weeded, I'ma hit it
All of these dramas, niggas ain't sayin' they did it
Lil Lay commited (damn right)
Niggas is bucklin' up under pressure
Nevertheless still screamin' they thugs
If crap don't work for the number 1
I'm packin' my heat, sellin' more drugs
Ain't a damn thing ceasin, if my bankroll decreasin'
Open up shop at the first of the month
nigga, continue my creepin' on a come up
until I'm done up, dead and gone
You can look at my life and call me bad
But nigga, you read me wrong
And, nigga, I be head over heels 'til I get fifty mill or mo'
If it's this dough these niggas wanna kill me for
Well I refuse to be broke
I'm contemplatin' murder on the government
Desporito be the motto
All shit be hard to swallow be ready for war if you follow
Atend hut, two, three, fo'
Soldiers get your paper
Nigga, you die if you a hater
Take it from a thug by nature, by nature

(Chorus)x4
