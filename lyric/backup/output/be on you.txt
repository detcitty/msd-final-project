I said excuse me little mama if I may
Take this thought and send it your way
And if you don't like that, then send it right back,
But I just gotta say
I wanna be on you (on you)
I wanna be on you (on you)
And if you don't like that, then send it right back
But I just gotta say, I just gotta say

Hey, shawty with no limits, that's what I need all the time,
I'm wit with with it, she with it, she not sure she put it down
