Turn up the bass, turn up the treble
I'm about to take you to a whole other level!
Dj turn off what you're playing
I want the whole club to hear what I'm saying!
Because this girl means so much to me
And now we're on the floor and she touching me.
And if I wanna take her home
It's gonna be better than what they do on the radio!
It's gotta be the crunkest

It's gotta be the loudest
It's gotta be the best
the best love song she ever heard in her life
I gotta tell her how I feel
I gotta let her hear, the best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it
