Wake me up before you go, ooh I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
Wake me up before you go, ooh I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love

Oh I need a jumpstart, when you call me, I'm running to ya
Gimme a headstart, thank God, gonna have me like hallelujah
Even though I'm a man girl, you making me feel like a baby
Oh girl when you lay in my arms, I'll take advantage of the moment
