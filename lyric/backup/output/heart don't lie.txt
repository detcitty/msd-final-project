No bother trying tee hide
From what you feel inside

Five long months? we've been going steady
I know it seems like a long time
When I ask the question, you say you're not ready
I'm not sure it's time for this right now
Don't try to hide it
With words that just aren't true
It's showing in your eyes
I see it, and so do you

But your Heart don't lie
You can tell me any old thing
Heart don't lie
It won't let you be deceiving
You know your heart don't lie

I don't want your life, just want to share it
Want the same thing? though I just don't know
