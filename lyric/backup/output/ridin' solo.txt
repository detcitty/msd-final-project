I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine
I'm lovin' cloud nine, my head's in the sky
I'm solo, I'm ridin' solo
I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridin solo, solo

Yeah, I'm feelin' good tonight
Finally doing me and it feels so right, oh
Time to do the things I like
Going to the club everything's alright, oh

No one to answer to
No one that's gonna argue, no
And since I got that hold off me
I'm livin' life now that I'm free, yeah

Told me get my shit together
Now I got my shit together, yeah
Now I made it through the weather
Better days are gonna get better

I'm so sorry that it didn't work out
I'm movin' on
I'm so sorry but it's over now
The pain is gone
