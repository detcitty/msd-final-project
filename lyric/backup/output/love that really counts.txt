I used to think that
The best things in life
Were the things that
Only money could buy

So I hustled instead
Never took time to pray
There was nothing new
That I wouldn't try

Hey, then one day I found
There was no love around
I was feeling kind
Of empty inside

Without the love of someone
Living just ain't no fun
That's when I first realized

That it's love that really counts
Everything else can run out
And if you find a love that's true
Better try your best to
