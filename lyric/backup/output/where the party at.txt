C'mon, c'mon, yeah, c'mon, yeah

Uh, oh
(Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

(Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Uh, oh
(Uh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh
The parties where you're at then let me know

[Incomprehensible] don't be trippin' when you see us in the club
Just show a little love, represent your side like me
'Cuz round here if you slip you catch a hot on
Twelve shotgun, couple of 'em got one

Belvedere in the rear of the club, pulled up on dubs
And we 'bout two go and buy the bar up
So, so, for sure we ain't playin', hang with no lames+
If you bumpin' say it

A, where the party at?
Girl's on their way where that Bacardi at?
Bottles and models talkin' all of that
You know I can't forget about my thugs

(Where the party at?)
And all my girlz
(Where the party at?)
Off in the club
(Where the party at?)
If the parties where you at, let me hear you say

Uh, oh
(Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Uh, oh
(Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Uh, oh
(Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
