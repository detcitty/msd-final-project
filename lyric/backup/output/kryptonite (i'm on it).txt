(Verse 1: Rock-D)
Time an' time again I gotta turn back round an' tell dese hoes
Dat I'm the H-N-I-C, bitch dats just the way it goes
I be on dat shit dat have you on it I don't want no mo
At dis time I'll need all my freak hoes to get down on the flo'
If you came to rep yo set break dat nigga I let 'em kno'
If it's jail I get for stompin' hatas to sleep, f**k it I go
Freak I'll be off in yo sheets straight geeked swervin' down yo street
In a stolen Bonneville wit 23's on the feet
Collection while he do brown, back in town to do re-bag
Give me face, I love the sound
Slap the taste they hit the ground
Back in the A
Hooked up, clicked up wit sum people dat don't play
On dat Kryptonite stay
So high we might fly awwwaaayyy

(Chorus)
(Rock-D)
I be on dat Kryptonite
Straight up on dat Kryptonite
