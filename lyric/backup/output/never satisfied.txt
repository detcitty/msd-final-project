(Chorus)
Never Satisfied
Never Satisfied
Never Satisfied
Never Satisfied

I know I've given you all that I've could
No matter what I do to you it never good
I'm always doin' the best that I can
The way you make me feel I never understand

You don't appreciate anything I ever do (No you don't appreciate the things I do)
