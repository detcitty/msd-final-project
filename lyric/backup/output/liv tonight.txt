[Keri Hilson:]
I just wanna live tonight*
I just wanna live tonight away
I just wanna live tonight
I just wanna live my life, ay

I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I just wanna live tonight
I just wanna live tonight away
I just wanna live tonight
I just wanna live my life, ay

New York, LA, Chicago, VA, Saint Louis
I just wanna live my life, ay
Hey Vegas, Miami, hey London
Chicago, hey Providence
(I said, I said, I said)
I just wanna live my life, ay

Top down there's a road on the backstreet
Shot gun with a twin in the backseat
No one with them two, it's just me
Pull up to the club like a pimpsy
Shouts out to the players in the VIP
Hey DJ, yeah you remember me
It's the nigga with same proof from outta suit
And we be, we be

Poppin' bottles, making noise
On the tables, on the bars
And at every bar
Tell them girls to freak them boys
I feel the patron jello shots
I'm throwing one hundred dollar rain drops
I live it up, yo, and they not, they not
