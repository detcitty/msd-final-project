(Bridge) 50 Cent
I Like the Way she do it
I Like the Way she do it
I Like the Way she do it
I Like the Way she do it

(Chorus) 50 Cent
I Said
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the doe
I said I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64
I Said
I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the doe
I said I Like the Way she do it, She put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64

(Verse 1)
Im suppose to blow, you suppose to know
Not to go against me or it R.I.P
I'm stupid rich, got retarded money
I'm special Ed, I got special bread
It's easy now, please believe me now
I dismiss a hoe, bitch leave me now
I f**k when I want, I do what I like
She want the same chick I want, the bitch is a dike
She a super freak, the freak of the week
I give her something a suck, she give her something to eat
It never enough, she like it rough
We keep it going and we switch positions, listen

(Bridge) 50 Cent
I Like the Way she do it
