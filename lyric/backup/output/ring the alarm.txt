Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Getting the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'bach or the Rolls
If I let you go

She gon' profit everything I taught

If I let you go

I can't let you go
Damn, if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,

And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?

People told me 'bout the flames

I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
