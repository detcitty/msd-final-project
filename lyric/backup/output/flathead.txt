Well just because she feeds me well
And she made me talk dirty in a pink hotel
It doesn't mean she's got eyes for me
She might just want my bones, you see

Hey, flathead, don't you get me
She's the second-best killer that I ever have seen
They don't come much more sick than you
I could go on, if you want me to

It's just so wrong, so very nice
And I told you once, but you killed me twice
I saw you one time at the back of the club
Chewing on glass and a ticket stub

Said I heard they kicked the boy 'til he bled
And you stood and said, "Oh my God" 'til she said
