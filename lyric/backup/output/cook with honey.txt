Everything is fading away
I'm looking forward to my final daze
To the end of my horrid life
At the end of my table
Sits my butcher knife
Can't stand your lies
Or your twisted truth
Can't stand your logic
Can't stand your views
I've been through your twisted maze
And i'm still waiting for my final daze
