You're not sure what you want to do
With your life
But you sure don't want me in it
Yeah you're sure the life you're
Living with me
Can't go on one single minute
And there's a new one waiting
Outside this door
And now's the time to begin it

You found a new world and
You want to taste it
But that world can turn cold and
You better face it
