Are you ready boots?
Start walkin'
Yee Haw
come on
Let's go

You keep sayin you got somethin for me
Well officer I don't mind to say you do
Now your lookin right where I thought you'd be looking
Legs come handy when law's in front of you

These boots are made for walkin
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You believe you've stopped me for a reason (uh)
Now I'm pretending my bendings just for fun
You keep playin where I got you playin (yeah)
These double - D initals work to run

These boots are made for walkin
