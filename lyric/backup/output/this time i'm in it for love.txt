I heard the weatherman
Predict a sunny day
He did not mean to lie
I look outside it's raining anyway
I guess I can live with a rainy day

Cause in the scheme of things
You're bound lose a few
Even your best-made plans
Before you know it, they are falling through
But that couldn't happen to me oooh and you
