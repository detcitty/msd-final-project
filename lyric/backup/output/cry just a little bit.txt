Everytime you have to whisper good-bye

Well
I cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit.
I know it's crazy and I don't know why

But I die just a little bit
die just a little bit.
I need to be the one that's by your side
you are the beat in my heart.
My love for you is something I can't hide

And I cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit

Cry just a little bit
cry just a little bit.
Every night before I'm fallin' asleep
