Hey, up in the backwoods, down in the holler,
Old boys feelin' like a dog on a collar,
Keepin' that chain pulled tight,
Waitin' on Saturday night.

Put on the smell-good, put on skinner'n,
Head into to town like a NASCAR winner.
Cruisin' back an' forth to the Tasty-Freeze.
Everywhere you look, all you see...

Is hillbilly deluxe, slick pick-up trucks.
