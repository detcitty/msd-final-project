You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love

The space between
The tears we cry...
Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The space between...
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again

These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing
