Yo this is Nappy Boy Radio live
With your boy T-Pain, we love rap music
Listen, uh, we got a caller on line one
Caller, what's your problem?

Hello, I'm on the radio with T-Pain
How's it goin'?
It ain't goin' good
My girl ain't doin' her things she used to do and oh

I got just what you need
Brand new Chris Brown, T-Pain
You heard it here first Nappy Boy Radio
We love you

Hey, she want that lovey dovey
(Lovey dovey)
That kiss, kiss
(Kiss, kiss)
In her mind she fantasize 'bout gettin' with me

They hatin' on me
(Hatin' on me)
They wanna diss, diss
(Kiss, kiss)
Because she mine and so fine, thick as can be

She want that lovey dovey
(Lovey dovey)
That kiss, kiss
(Kiss, kiss)
In her mind she fantasize 'bout gettin' with me

They hatin' on me
(Hatin' on me)
They wanna diss, diss
(Kiss, kiss)
Because she mine and so fine, thick as can be

I'm a country boy from Tappahannock, VA is where I reside
So shawty understand it and I know I just turned 18
And I get a little mannish and you see this bandana hangin'
That means I'm like a bandit like, like a bandit, bandit

I got paper girl, the Lamborghini
