My nigga on the road
You never told me
Montana

It be hard to watch a cab when the van keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets
And the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me cause my jaw keep lockin'

I chew your lil' one up
I boot a nigga up
Got the snipers in the dually truck and we tooly'd up
I be tryin' change my life
But a monkey on my back
I've been rollin' all night
I got a monkey on my back
(skrrr, skrrr)
All about the mula
Throw a hundred chains on, tryna cool her
