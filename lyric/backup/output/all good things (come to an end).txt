Honestly, what would become of me?
Don't like reality
It's way too clear for me
But really, life is dandy
We are what we don't see
We miss everything daydreaming

Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?
Flames to dust, lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end?
Come to an end, come to en end
Why do all good things come to an end?
Come to an end, come to an end
Why do all good things come to an end?

Travelling, I only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay, young and restless
Living this way, I stress less
