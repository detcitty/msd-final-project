Write a letter, write another letter
Write a letter, write another letter
I´m sealing up this letter
I just finished signing your name
My friends would all be surprised
If they knew I was playing this game
I´ll pretend it´s a special delivery
And just to give me a hint
I´ll use your favorite color
Smear it with your favorite scent
I know you think that i´m crazy
