I've been a Bad Boy
Now I wanna come back home
I've been a Bad Boy
Now I wanna come back home

I admit that I was messin' around
Playin' Macho Man and bein' cool
But all along you knew right from the start
She was just playin' me for a fool
Now that the love affair is over
Here I come runnin' to you
So go ahead girl and punish me
