When you're ready come and get it
Na na na na

When you're ready come and get it
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
When you're re-e-e-e-e-e-eady
When you're re-e-e-e-e-e-eady, ready
When you're ready come and get it
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
You ain't gotta worry, it's an open invitation
I'll be sittin' right here, real patient
All day, all night, I'll be waitin' standby
Can't stop because I love it, hate the way I love you
All day, all night, maybe I'm addicted for life, no lie
I'm not too shy to show I love you, I got no regrets
I love you much, too much to hide you, this love ain't finished yet
This love ain't finished yet
