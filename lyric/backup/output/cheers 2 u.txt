If I had a wish
Baby, I wish he never left you feeling like this
'Cause I can feel your pain
But if you just could get over him

Maybe some wine will empty your mind
Girl, I'ma make it better
Now can we dim the lights
Let's make a toast, that it will be alright

Cheers 2 U for givin' me a chance
I'll be your angel your guardian man
Cheers 2 U for givin' me a chance
I'll be your angel your guardian angel

I know we can win and you can depend on me
