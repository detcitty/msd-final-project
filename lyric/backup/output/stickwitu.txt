I don't want to go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybody is breaking up
And throwing their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say, hey

Nobody gonna love me better
I'mma stick with you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'mma stick with you

You know how to appreciate me
I'mma stick with you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'mma stick with you

I don't want to go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
See the way we ride in our private lives
Ain't nobody getting in between
