Keep bustin'!
Dig if U will the picture
Of U and I engaged in a... kiss
U don't have 2 be beautiful 2 turn me on
If we can not make babies
Maybe we can make some time
(Baby, U're so creamy)

She said how'd U like 2 waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind
Nikki, oh

Don't worry, I won't hurt U
I only want U 2 have some fun
Baby, baby, baby I'm a star (Star, ooh)
Might not know it now
Baby, but I are, I'm a star, eh (Star, ooh)
I don't wanna stop 'til I reach the top, oh
Ow!

If I gave U diamonds and pearls
Would U be a happy boy or a girl?
All I can do is just offer U my love
All I can offer U is my love

I never meant 2 cause U any sorrow
I never meant 2 cause U any pain
I only wanted one time 2 see U laughing
Only want 2 see U laughing in the purple rain

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here 2day 2 get through this thing called life

Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body
Sexy dancer, dance
Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body
Sexy dancer, dance
Ahhh!

Work it baby, work it
Let's work {x2}
I've had my eyes on U
