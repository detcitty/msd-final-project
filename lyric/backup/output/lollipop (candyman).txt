I am the candy man
Coming from bounty land
I am the candy man
Coming from bounty land

I wish that you were my lollipop
Sweet things, I will never get enough
If you show me to the sugar tree
Will you give me a soda pop for free

Come with me honey
I'm your sweet sugar candyman
Run like the wind fly with me to bounty land
Bite me, I'm yours if you're hungry please understand
This is the end of the sweet sugar candyman

Oh my love I know you are my candy man
