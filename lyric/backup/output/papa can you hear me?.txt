[Rachel]
God... [our heavenly Father]
Oh, God... [and my father, who is also in heaven]
May the light... [of this flickering candle]
Illuminate the night the way your spir't illuminates my soul...

Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you hear me in the night?
Papa, are you near me?
