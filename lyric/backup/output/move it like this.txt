[Intro:]
Smooth!

Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)(hold me, squeeze me)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)(hold me, squeeze me)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)

[Verse 1:]
In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
He stepped into the streets and walked up to this girl
He had a cap tooth made of gold
He had an earing in his nose
And her looks, that a night he liked to twirl
And he says:
? I love the way you look at me, I love your smile
Why don't you come and talk to me just for a while?
Give me your love, oohhh give me your love
Why don't you come and talk to me, give me your love?
And we can move it like this?

Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)

[Verse 2:]
And now the hours go by fast
And memories come from the past
As he tells the girl the story of his life
You see a long long time ago
He fell in love, but let her go
And if he had the chance again, she'd be his wife
