Pour me, pour me
Pour me, pour me another shot of whiskey
Bartender hit me one more time
He left, I cried
I'm lost inside, won't ya help me
Fill it to the top 'cause I hit rock bottom this time

Well I don't want to listen to the old jukebox
So don'tcha put no quarters in the slot
I don't wanna talk and I don't wanna dance
I dang sure ain't lookin' for romance
