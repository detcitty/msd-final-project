I've been out on this highway now
Five days in a row
My words all run together
My feet are movin' slow
Ive got to stop and eat
While its still light
There's a local angel sitting on my right
Do you believe in love at first sight
Baby, you look good to me tonight

I'm ordinarily very shy
And I'd be polite if I had time
Baby, you look good to me tonight
Tomorrow, Ill be good and gone
Please don't make me wait that long
