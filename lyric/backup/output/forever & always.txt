Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something, I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye & told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak, I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened?
Please tell me 'cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low, you can feel nothin' at all
And you flashback to when he said forever & always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
