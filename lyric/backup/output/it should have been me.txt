I saw my love
Walking down the aisle
And as he passed me by
He turned to me and
Gave me a smile

Then the preacher
Then the preacher
The preacher joined their hands

And all the people
The people began to stand
When I shouted

It should have been me
Oh, it should have been me
You know it should have been me
Baby, how can you do this to me
