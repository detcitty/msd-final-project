She leads a lonely life...
she leads a lonely life.

When she woke up late
in the morning light
and the day had just begun...

She opened up
her eyes and thought
oh, what a morning.

It's not a day for work,
it's a day for catching tan
just laying on the beach
and having fun
she's going to get you.

All that she wants
is another baby
she's gone tomorrow, boy...
all that she wants
