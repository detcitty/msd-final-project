I ain't no hater or nothing
But he can't love you like I can
Trust me

As the clock strikes twelve
I'm sitting here wondering how the hell
Did I let you leave
And baby I know that I did my share
Of things to deceive you
I'm just trying to get an understanding
Of what to do
'Cause I'm halfway going crazy
Girl they can't fade me

He can't love you like I love you
Baby you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man
If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can

He can't love you like I love you
