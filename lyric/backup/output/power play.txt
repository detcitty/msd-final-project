What you gona do
When you're feelin' blue
You think you're lookin'
At some river run dry
Well, it's nothing new
Still the same old dues
There ain't no reason for asking why.

Chorus:
'Cause it's a power play
Just like yesterday
There ain't no second-guessing now
Well, you had your way
So what can you say
One shot is all you're allowed.

There's a catch-22
Just waitin' on you
Try talkin' your way out of this
For all those lies
