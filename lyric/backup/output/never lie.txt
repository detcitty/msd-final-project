Friends come a dime a dozen, Ooh
but I know that I will never find a friend like you, Ooh
And that's why I wanna sing this song, wherever you are
Wherever (I will never lie again, Ooh)
I just want to let you know
that I will never lie again (I will never lie again)(I promise)

I will never lie again, Ooh
Cause you'll always be my friend (you will always be)
I will never lie again (I will never lie)
Cause a friend like you, will last forever
