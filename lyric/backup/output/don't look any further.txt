Whoa, oh, well, well, well, well, well
Ooh, hmmmm

Someone to count on
In a world ever changing
Here I am, stop where you're standin'

What you need is a lover
A man to take over
Oh girl, don't look any further

Strange, when you think of the chances
That we'd both be in a state of mind
Too cool to be careless
Lookin' for the right thing
Oh baby, don't look any further
