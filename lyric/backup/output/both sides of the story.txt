'Though we might hate to admit it, there are always two sides to every story...'

Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town
where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down
sleeping with an empty bottle, he's a sad and an empty hearted man
all he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can

We always need to hear both sides of the story
