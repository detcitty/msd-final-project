Haha, yeah
Whattup ma? How you been
Yeah I know, I know, hehe
It's all good (Murder Inc.)

Girl your stare, those eyes I (love it when you look at me baby)
Your lips, your smile I (love it when you kiss me baby)
Your hips, those thighs, I (love it when you thug me baby)
And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm witchu baby)

I, got a fetish for fuckin you witcha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin so long? I'm gettin anxious
But patiently waitin for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin to G you, ma I'm tryin to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin the dick game is potent
Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin, lovin the way you be moanin
Grippin the sheets, lookin at me lickin at me
Cause every woman just wanna be happy
