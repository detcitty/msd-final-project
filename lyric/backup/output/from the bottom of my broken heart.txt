Ooo-Hoo hoo hoo
Na na na na na na
Never look back we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead
Emptiness behind, where do I go?
And you didn't hear all my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears, did you know?
Still I miss you somehow

From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
