My daddy taught me that in this country everyone's the same
You work hard for your dollar and you never pass the blame
When it don't go your way

Now I see all these big shots whinin' on my evening news
About how they're losin' billions and it's up to me and you
To come running to the rescue

Well pardon me if I don't shed a tear
Cause they're selling make believe
