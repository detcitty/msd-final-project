She got the call today, one out of the grey
And when the smoke cleared, it took her breath away
She said she didn't believe, it could happen to me
I guess we're all one phone call from our knees
We're gonna get there soon

If every building falls, and all the stars fade
We'll still be singin' this song, the one they can't take away
