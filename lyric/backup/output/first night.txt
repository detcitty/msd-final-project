We will remember this first night forever
After all the songs fade away
And the stage fades to gray

And we will remember this first night together
We'll recall the things that we said
All the foolish dreams in our head
On the night we met

I'm searching your eyes, have I seen you somewhere
You're filling my thoughts with a strange intrigue
I rivet my glance to your every movement
I got a notion your love's in a whole different league

Tell me your name
What's your persuasion
Your first impression
Of this whole occasion
