Reporter: 'Excuse me mam, what do you think about all the
Protests in America today?'
Lady: 'Well, my advice to all the a demonstraters would be
Either love it or leave it.'
Reporter: 'Pardon me sir, what do you think of America
And all the protest that's going on?'
Man: 'Protest huh, well, I think they may have a valid
Point. I mean, like, something's got to be done in Ameica, 
Either we change it or lose it.'

I'm tired of all your protests
They're getting out of hand
And all you politicians
You're too vague to understand
And somewhere in the middle of
Two extremes without a plan
