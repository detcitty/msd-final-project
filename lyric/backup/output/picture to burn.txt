State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine you won't mind if I say
By the way...
I hate that stupid old pickup truck

You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreaker
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn
