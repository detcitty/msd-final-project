Ohhhhhhhh ohhhh
Oohh ohhhh

There are times
I swear I know you're here
I forget about my fears
Feelin you my dear

Watchin over me
My hope sees
What the future will bring
When you wrap your wings
And take me where you are
Where you and I will be together
Once again, we'll be dancin in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
And you'll be smilin back at me
Only then will I be free
When I can be, where you are

And I can see your face
Your kiss I still can taste
