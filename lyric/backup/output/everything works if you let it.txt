(Alternate intro)
[Everything'll work out if you let itEverything'll work out if you let itEverything'll work out if you let itLet it in your heart]

Everything works if you let it
If you let it in your heart
Yeah, everything works if you let it
If you let it in your heart

She is the girl of his dreams
He wants her, he thinks "forget it"
He's got a pain in his heart he feels like crying
So lonesome for love he feels like dying
But don't stop the dream
He can fix it, I know he can
