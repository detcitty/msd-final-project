I was in a daze, movin' in the wrong direction
Feelin' that I'd always be the lonely one
Then I saw your face on the edge of my horizon
Whisperin' that I wasn't the only one, the lonely one

One chance intervention
See what it can signify
The slightest mis-apprehension, baby
We'd have passed each other by

When I heard your sweet voice callin'
Saw your light come shinin' through
I couldn't stop my heart from turning
