Don't wanna make a scene,
I really don't care if people stare at us,
Sometimes I think I'm dreaming,
I pinch myself, just to see if I am awake or not.
Is it real? What I feel, could it be you and me,
Till the end of time?
Though we are miles apart, 'take my heart, hold it tight it's true love,
You know I got to be...

Chorus.
I gotta be the one you touch,
Baby, I gotta be the one you love,
I gotta be the one you feel,
