What if a woman had a man on the side
And she never spent time with you
What if a woman said she's working late
And it's always the same excuse

What if a woman took the keys to your whip
Said I'll be right back, don't trip
What if a woman left you home with the kids
Changing diapers and shit, what a twist

Could you stand inside her shoes and walk a mile
(I don't really think so)
Could you hold her down when she doesn't smile
(I don't know a man who could)

What if a woman, what if a woman
(What if a woman)
What if a woman, was just like you
(Yeah, yeah)
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like me
(Try to imagine that)

What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like us
(Oh, think about it now)
What if a woman, what if a woman, what if a woman
(Oh yeah)
Could you handle all she does
