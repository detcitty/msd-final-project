Breaker breaker take me home
You know the one I wanna see

Gimme your north bound seven five
I been headed for that campin' town
South bound is my ride

Eight more hours I'll be shiftin' gears
Look over your shoulder, guy
Won't you lend me your ears?

It's been so long since I've seen my home
Got to get on down that road tonight
The one I love is waitin' there for me
With open arms and love in her eyes
