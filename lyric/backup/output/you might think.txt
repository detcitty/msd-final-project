Oh well uh, you might think h'm crazy
To hang around with you
Or maybe you think I'm lucky
To have somethin' to do
But I think that you're wild
Inside me is some child
You might think I'm foolish

Or maybe it's untrue
(You might think I'm crazy)
You might think I'm crazy
(All I want is you)
All I want is you
You might think it's hysterical
