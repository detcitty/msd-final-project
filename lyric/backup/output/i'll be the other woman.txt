I'll be the other woman
All your life
Just as long as I am the only one
Other than your wife

Your wife, how would she feel
If she caught us together
The same way I would feel
If I caught you with another

Home I know comes first
And second to that I'll be
When you're not there with her
I want you right here with me

I'll be the other woman
Just as long as I know
I'm the only other woman
