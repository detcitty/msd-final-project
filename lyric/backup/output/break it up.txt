Made myself a prisoner
I locked myself away
Can't remember the last time
I saw the light of day
Don't want to face life
Feel I've been betrayed
I want you tell me
Where our love went astray

So can't you wait one more minute
Why can't you wait one more day
Let's get it straight
'Cause it's a big mistake
We better think about it

I don't want to break it up
Why do we have to break it up?
Never ever want to break it up oh no
