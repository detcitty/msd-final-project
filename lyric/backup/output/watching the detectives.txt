Nice girls, not one with a defect
Cellophane shrink-wrapped, so correct
Red dogs under illegal legs
She looks so good that he gets down and begs

She is watching the detectives
"Ooh, it's so cute"
She's watching the detectives
When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart

Long shot of that jumping sign
