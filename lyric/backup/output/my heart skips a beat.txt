My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't what to do
I'm so in love with you
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't know what to do
Can't you feel it beat

Feel it beat

Something in your eyes
Seems to hypnotize
Every time I look at you
I get butterflies

Something in your smile
Brightens up my day
I just can't help myself
You make me feel this way

And there's nothing in this world
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
Everything would be so fine
Baby, baby, baby if you only knew

My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't what to do
I'm so in love with you
My heart skips a beat
Everytime we meet
I don't know what to do
Can't you feel it beat

Feel it beat
