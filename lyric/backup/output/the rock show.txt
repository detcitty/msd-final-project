Hanging out behind the club on the weekends
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there

She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me

She's the one, she'll always be there

She took my hand and I made it, I swear
