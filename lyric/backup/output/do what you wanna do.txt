Come on man
I need somethin' that I can move to
You better gimme some of that funk
Pulled up, at the red light
Cutie crept up on my left side
Window down, waitin' for my reply
Not a word, I saw it in his eyes
Tell me somethin' good baby
He said, "Whatever you wanna do"
He pulled to the curb, hazards flashed bright
I got out with a catwalk stride
Short skirt, golden brown thighs
Gucci heels, four inch high, he touched my face
Smiled and said, "Whatever you wanna do"
Now I, I said, "I usually need
Some time to get inside"
