We got it together darlin'
We're ready for it
You see I'm smilin'

We got the peope talkin'
They know how it feels
And it's no big deal

And we're not playin' games
And we're not playin' lovers
We mean a lot more than that

Hear what I'm sayin' boy
Let go and be my joy
I have to love you

You can't deny it, baby
We drive each other crazy
You can't deny it, baby
No two people ever felt this way

You can't deny it, baby
We drive each other crazy
You can't deny it, baby
We just got to let it out

Let it out, let it out
Let it out
