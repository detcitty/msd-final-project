Well come and listen in
To a radio station
Where the mighty hosts
Of heaven sing
Turn your radio on
(Turn your radio)
Turn your radio on
(Turn your radio on)
If you want to feel
Those good vibrations
Comin' from the joy
That His love can bring
Turn your radio on
(Turn your radio on)
Turn your radio on
Turn your radio on
