If you want my love tell me 'bout tomorrow
Cause I can't wait one more day
Cold in the night waiting for a promise
So all alone I'm hanging on

Woman don't play this game
You'll never get my lovin this way
All this time you've been livin' for the moment
It works for some, but not for me no

Chorus:
It's not enough, to tell me you love me
