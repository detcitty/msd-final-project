There's been a hundred if there's been one, whoa, oh
And they have all been nice for a while, uh huh, yea
But then one day, I call on you
And I got to let ya know
That there's a feeling inside that I cant explain
But id like to let it go

'Cause I've never had a love like this
No I never had a love like this
And I cant explain the way
It feels but it feels right, yea
