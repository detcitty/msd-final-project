Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
It's so hard to break in
There's no way to fake it

Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feelin'
And I shouldn't believe in
The dreams that I'm dreamin'

I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount too much
But they're never gonna change my mind, no

Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby

Tell me, Tell me, Tell me
Something I don't know
Something I don't know
Something I don't know

Tell me
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me
