Ooh hoo-hoo Jackie Blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Hides her smile when she's wearing a frown
Ooh Jackie you're not so down
You like your life in a freeform style
You'll take an inch but you'd love a mile
There never seems to be quite enough
Floating around to fill your lovin' cup
Ooh hoo-hoo Jackie Blue
