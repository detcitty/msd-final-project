Boy I'ma make you love me, make you want me
And I'ma give you some attention, tonight
Now follow my intuitions, what you're wishin
See I'ma keep you up all night, for a long time
Just start countin the ways

[Chorus]
Break me off, show me what you got
Cause I don't want, no one minute man
Break me off, show me what you got
