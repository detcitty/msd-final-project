Intro:

Take em out, take em out, bring em out dead
Shine em up, shine em up, shine the bald head
One gun, two gun, three gun, four
You're, mine, it's all about crime
Onyx! (echoes)

Verse One: Suave

It's time to get live, live, live like a wire
I set a whole choir on fire (UHH!)
Well done, on the grill, shot skills kills
and no frills - they try to diss me? They gettin crispy
Ha, ha hah hah, AND WE DO IT LIKE THIS
In fact,? and jack Jack's
Cause they can burn in hell shit for all that I care
Beware the bald head the dread said is they fear
Stick-up's assassin, traction new reaction
These fuckin niggaz shoulda made the All Madden
Onyx is wreckin shit, slip slide step quick
? Infinite that gets crashed like a rented
The shit they write is black and white; well mines got mad color
Ain't that right, my blood brother?
Word up, raise it up!
We do it with the crew that don't give a fuck
