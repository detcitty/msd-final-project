I would walk home every evening
Through the pyramids of light
I would feed myself from silence
Wash it down with empty nights

Then your innocent distractions
Hit me so hard
My emotional reaction
Caught me off guard

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before
And it was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more

No one else
Has ever made me feel this way
