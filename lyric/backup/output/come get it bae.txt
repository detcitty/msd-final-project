You miss me?
I miss all of y'all
All of you girls standin' together like that, I can't take it (uhn)

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey) Women,
I can do anything you like
I can do anything you need
And I got a better body
Than the magazines you read
None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy
And if they tried, they can not do it just like me

I know you certainly been gone
And it's been much too long
And there's some things we need to do
So I know you need to get home

Come get it bae (hey, c'mon)
Come get it bae (hey)
