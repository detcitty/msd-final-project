I, love you and I, need you
Nelly I, love you, I do need you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, ya know I'm crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Ya know I'm crazy over you

I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
And she got the hots for me, the finest thing my hood has seen
But oh, no, no, she's got a man and a son doh' oh
But that's okay 'cause I, wait for my cue and just listen

Play my position like a short stop
Pick up everything mommy hittin'
And in no time, I'm gonna make this friend mine

And that's for sure
Cause I, I've never been the type to break-up a happy home
But somethin' 'bout, baby, girl, I just can't leave alone
So tell me more what's it gonna be she said
You don't know what you mean to me

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, ya know I'm crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
