Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin' wit ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg & D.R.E.
'99 nigga
Guess who's back?
Still, still doin' that shit, Andre?
Oh, for sure
Yeah
Check me out

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown alot, can't keep it home alot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga?
My last album was The Chronic
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it
If you ain't up on things
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leafs
Still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thing
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
Still
Hittin' them corners in them low-low's girl
Still
Takin' my time to perfect a beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangsta's all across the world
Still
