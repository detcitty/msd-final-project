Couple in the next room
Bond to win a prize
They've been going at it all night long
Well, I'm trying to get some sleep
But these motel walls are cheap
Lincoln Duncan is my name
And here's my song, here's my song

My farter was a fisherman
My mama was a fisherman's friend
And I was born in the boredom
And the chowder
