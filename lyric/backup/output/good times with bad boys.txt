You're gonna see some changes in me
from now on i have a heart of stone
i'm not the girl i used to be
i'm going out into the danger zone
And i don't mind what people may say
should i care what they think of me?
i'm looking out for a different way
i'm cuttin' loose, runnin' wild and free
Know what i want, know where to go
no one can stop me, no
whoa, whoa
