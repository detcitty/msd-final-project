When I kiss your lips I just don't want to behave
My passion runs deeper and, girl, I'm not afraid
To bare my heart and soul and let it tumble all out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about

When I kiss your lips, I just don't know where I stand
My passion runs deeper and things get out of hand
I'll bare my heart and soul and let it tumble all out
But if you say the word you'll have me talkin' about

(Too much passion) girl, whenever we touch
