A-one, two, a-one, two, three, four!

This here's a story about a house husband who, you know, just has to get out of the house. He's been lookin' at, you know, the kids for days and days. He's been washin' the dishes and screwin' around and watching... until he goes CRAZY!

Woke up this morning, blues around my head
No need to ask the reason why
Went to the kitchen and lit a cigarette
Blew my worries to the sky

I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out
