You're the kind of woman, I've been dreaming of.
But I never thought I could ever say it good enough to win your love
You probably think I'm foolish you probably tell me so
I open up my heart then you're probably going to tell me no, but here I go
I want to give you all I've got inside, I want to love you for the rest of my life

There I've done it.
There I've said it.
There you have it.
I don't regret it.
