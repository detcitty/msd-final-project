Don't do that
Baby, please don't do that
What are you cryin' for?
Is it because you're sad, or mad
Or nothing's gonna go wrong?

Sometimes we feel inside of us that
That everythin' we have is, only here for today
But every now and then two people get lucky
And find that certain thing that makes them wanna
Just keep it, just keep it that way

I don't want you to feel that
That you have to go through
These changes when
Knowin' no way
