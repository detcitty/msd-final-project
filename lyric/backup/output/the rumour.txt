(Elton John/Bernie Taupin)

This is the last time
I'll look across this table
And try to face a feeling I don't even recognize
This is a sad hand
That reached across and touched you
When all we'd built around us came crashing to the ground

There was a tide turning
Somewhere deep inside us
When all these years together seem lost behind my tears
Oh there were good times
But in between the dog days
