Uh, uhh, uhh, Kel's
Young, M, Xtra, money, let's go

Girl you know you got a body-adi-adi
(Do you like it?)
Where you get your little body-adi-adi
(Do you want it?)
Girl I wanna freak your body-adi-adi
(What you want it?)
I just wanna take you home with me
(Look at this)

She get it from her momma
You can't tie a sweater over that ass, it hotter than pajamas
We lay back, blowin' ganja
DVD, she make it hard to watch a flat TV, whoa
I crept up behind her
Mami threw it like a quarterback, I caught that like rice
I call mami Montana, bandanna
Tied her hands up, this is gangsta love

Threw on a rap CD, we gangsta fucked
This ain't R&B smooth, I ain't a R&B dude
Poured a glass of army, got mami in the mood
Then she stripped for me like the Moulin Rouge
I think I might wife her
Y'know, powder blue roc-a-wear suit, white Nike her
Add mami to the cypher
R.O.C. for life 'cuz, the gang motherfucker
