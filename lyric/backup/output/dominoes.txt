Steam was rising in the Asian quarter
When she stepped out in the street
Voices dropped and every eye was on her
As she braved the midnight heat

Dominique, she was a cool oasis
She could soothe the burning heart
Dreams of passion written on their faces
One by one they fall apart

Soldiers of fortune surrender like children
And follow wherever she leads

And they all fall down
It's one more night of
(Dominoes, dominoes)
