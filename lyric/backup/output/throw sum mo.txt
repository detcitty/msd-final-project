Ass fat
Yeah I know, you just got cash
Blow sum mo', blow sum mo', blow sum mo'
The more you spend it, the faster it go
Bad bitches, on the floor

Its rainin' hundreds
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'
Throw sum mo', throw sum mo'

Slim Jimmy
Hay, bye hater
I flood the club with paper
Shorty got an ass, some for now and some for later
Somethin' like Nicki's, dancin' like Maliah
I'm throwin' all this money I'ma fuck around and buy her
I can flick the money all night till my wrist tired
If you put in work, this the night you gonna retire

You a bad bitch, I ain't even gonna deny her
She told me "throw that money", I said "make it worth my while"
I'm bout to empty out the ATM (Throw it, throw it, throw it)
She doin' tricks that make a nigga wanna spend (blow it, blow it)
Girl you know you got me fascinated
Just keep on dancin' till I'm outta paper
