There's something about the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I want to ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
We're drivin' down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you
