Sometimes I watch you
As you're sleeping
And I can't believe
You're really here with me

I've got to pinch myself
To make sure that I'm not dreaming
Oh, something this good
How could it happen to me

I've never been the kind
That's lucky before
But my life changed when
You walked through my door

Now I'm more lucky than
I ever dreamed I would be

What are you doing with a fool like me
You could've found someone better
