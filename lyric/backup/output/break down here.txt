Mile marker 203
The gas gauge leanin' on the edge of E
And I'll be danged if the rain ain't pourin down

There's somethin smokin' underneath the hood
It's a bangin' and a clangin' and it can't be good
And it's another 50 miles to the nearest town

Everything I own is in the back in a Hefty bag
I'm outta cigarettes and I'm down to my last drag

I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothin' up ahead or in the rear-view mirror
