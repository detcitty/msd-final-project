Cut the music up
A lil' louder
Yeah

You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love

When you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
