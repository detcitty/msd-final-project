Think I might get lucky tonight
Let my hair down get a little crazy, yeah
My reflection's doing alright
It don't take nothing to introduce suggestion

Everybody's got one thing on their mind
A set of wheels and a cranked up radio
In this town there might be nowhere to hide
In this town there might be nowhere to go 'cause

On my left to my right
Oh this is my paradise
You can call it what you like
