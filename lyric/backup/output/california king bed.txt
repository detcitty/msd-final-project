Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I bet California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
