I'm sick and tired of being tired
I can't pick a side, the Gemini
Prophesize if we living, I
Promise momma not to feel no lie
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast

Can you please pray for me?

Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
Tell the squad come home
We gon' ball again 'fore he call us home
World is going brazy

Where did we go wrong?
It's a tidal wave, it's a thunderdome

Get God on the phone
I just got a raise (I just got a raise)
Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (diamonds all appraised)
