Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up
Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up
Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up

Twist it all up
Twist it all up

Everybody in the party
Hold your cup high move your body
If you twist it scream it loudly!

Ay, ay, ay, hey
Ay, ay, ay, hey

Coconut juice got me real loose
Like, got me leaning 3 thousand proof like
Coconut juice all on the dance floor
Fellas let your ladies go, ladies let your fellas go

Come back, went straight to the club
Entrance no charge cause we late to the club
Umm yes, we don't stand in the club
GED on the couch pouring drinks on the rug
What a mess, but we cleanin' the club
Ice so bright make a fight scene in the club
Don't test, cause there's beams in the club
Red beams in the club leave your jeans full of blood
