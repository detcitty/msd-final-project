Oh-oh-oh come up hard baby but not cool
I didn't make it sugar playin' by the rules
I come up hard babe but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sugar movin' down the line
I come up awful hard but that's ok 'cause trouble man don't get in my way
I come up hard baby

I mean for real baby

Gonna keep movin' gonna go to town

I come up hard but now I'm gettin' down
