Now listen up
She's a razor sharp
If she don't get her way
She'll slice you apart

Now she's a cool, cool black
She moves like a cat
If you don't get her game
Well you might not make it back

She got the looks that kill
That kill
She got the looks that kill
That kill
She got the look

(She's got the looks that kill)
