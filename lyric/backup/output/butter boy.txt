He was hard as a rock
But I was ready to roll
What a shock to find out
I was in control
Of the situation
I didn't need no
Time or destination
He said, say, you look divine
Have I met you before
I said, your place or mine
He said, hard to be sure
Of an invitation
In these times of
Casual, quick relations
Go, baby, go
Get it on, boy
