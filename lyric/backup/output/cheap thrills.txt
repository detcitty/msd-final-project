Up with it, girl
Rock with it, girl (Sia)
Show dem it, girl
Bada bang bang

Bounce with it, girl
Dance with it, girl
Get with it, girl
Bada bang bang
Come on, come on, turn the radio on

It's Friday night, and I won't be long

Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's Friday night, and I won't be long
Till I hit the dance floor (bada bang)
Hit the dance floor (bada bang)
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash

But I got you, baby (just you and me)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight

I love cheap thrills!

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I love cheap thrills!
But I don't need no money

U worth more dan diamond, more dan gold
