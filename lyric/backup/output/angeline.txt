Ridin' in a long gray limousine
Sittin' in a pair of hundred dollar jeans
Tryin' to talk sense to a rock 'n' roll queen
Damn, best kinda livin' anybody ever seen
Oh, Angeline

Oh, midnight struttin' in New York City
Midnight woman, she is lookin' so pretty
Her little heart beat in rhythm with the world
