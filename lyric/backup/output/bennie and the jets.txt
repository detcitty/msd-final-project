Hey kids shake it loose together
The spotlight's hittin' something that's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music solid walls of sound
Say Candy and Ronnie have you seen them yet?
Woo
But they're so spaced out
Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really clean
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, no oh
