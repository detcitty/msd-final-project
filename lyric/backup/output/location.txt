Send me your location lets
Focus on communicating 'cause
I just need the time and place to come through
(A chance to come through)
Send me your location lets
Ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
