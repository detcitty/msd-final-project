Spring's in the air
There's magic everywhere
When you're young and in love

Life seems to be, ooh, baby
A world of fantasy
When you're young and in love

Each night seems just
Like the Fourth of July
When stars spangle the sky

Dreams can come true
Ooh, baby, baby
If you believe they do
When you're young and in love
