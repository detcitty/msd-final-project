Yesterday when he came here
Willie's eyes swept the floor
And he looked so brought down
And he asked if I'd seen you around
I said no and I showed him to the door
Ah but he knows the score
Yeah he knows it

And we can't hide it anymore
We can't hide it anymore
We can't hi-a hi-a hide
We can't hide it anymore
We can't hi-a hi-a hide
No no no no no

And in the morning you're beside me
