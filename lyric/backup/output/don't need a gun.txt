A human heart goes out tonight
Yes, a red hot love on a red stop light
I see a scene, so cold it echoes in blue
Oh those twisting tongues they are after you

Wop bop a lu bop Son, you gotta move up
Flip flop fly
Lawdy Miss Clawdy
Of what a story dreams to buy
Don't need a knife to violate my life
It's all so insane

When the other man has none
