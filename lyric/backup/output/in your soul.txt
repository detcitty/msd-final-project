ever since i was a little kid
i have always thought
i could run faster than the wind
stare up to the sky with open spaces
i could live and die
man you can't find that in no book
never find that in no book
someone will drag you down
and try to knock you under
hey mama said with her words of wonder
don't matter cause
cause it's in your soul

i have always felt
