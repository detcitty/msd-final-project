She feels the ground is giving way
Bur she thinks we're better off that way
The more you take the less you feel
The less you know the more you believe
The more you have the more it takes today"

YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY
YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY
YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY
SHE DOESN'T CARE WHAT IT'S WORTH
SHE'S LIVING LIKE IT'S THE LAST NIGHT ON EARTH
