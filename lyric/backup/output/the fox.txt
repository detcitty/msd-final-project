Dog goes woof
Cat goes meow
Bird goes tweet
And mouse goes squeek

Cow goes moo
Frog goes croak
And the elephant goes toot

Ducks say quack
And fish go blub
And the seal goes ow, ow, ow

But there's one sound
That no one knows
What does the fox say?

Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding
What the fox say?

Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow
Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow
What the fox say?

Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho
Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho
