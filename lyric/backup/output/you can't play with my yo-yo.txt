Yo Jinx man, we gotta find somebody that's down for hers, man
All these girls simple man, who you think fit the category?

It's me, the brand new intelligent black woman Y-O-Y-O
Which is Yo-Yo, but I'm not to be played
Like I was made by matell
But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male
I rhyme about uprights upliftin the woman
For that are superior to handle by any male
Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show

And if you ask my producers that we fly and you know

You can't play with my Yo-Yo
"Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out"

My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho
I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift, as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who came to dap
To the fact I get the 8-ball, or the jam
The earrings I wear are called dophins
Check the booty, yo it's kinda soft and
If you touch, you livin in a coffin(word to mother)
I'm in the 90s, your still in the 80s right
I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady like
But I'ma lady, who will pull a stunt though
I kill suckas, and even hit the block
So what you wanna do?
Ya must play it wrong(ay yo)
Cause to me, you simply can't get none
You wetter, then a hotter ho in snow
Tell em Ice Cube!

No, you can't play with my Yo-Yo

Don't try play me out, don't try to play me out.
