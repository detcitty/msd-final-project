They’re the in crowd, we’re the other ones
It’s a different kind of cloth that we’re cut from
We let our colors show, where the numbers ain’t
With the paint where there ain’t supposed to be paint

That’s who we are
That’s how we roll
The Outsiders, The Outsiders

Our women get hot, and our leather gets stained
When we saddle up and ride 'em in the pouring rain
We’re the junkyard dogs, we’re the alley cats
Keep the wind at our front, and the hell at our back

That’s who we are
We do our talking, walk that walk
Wide open rocking
That’s how we roll
