I need you, (the) I need you
I need you, (the) I need you
I need you, the the the the the
I need you, (the) I need you
I need you, (the) I need you
I need you, the the the the the you the the the
I need you the most

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See I gave you faith turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
