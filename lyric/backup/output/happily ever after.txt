Guess what I did today
Those were the words I said to you
It was last may, dont know the exact day
In my hand there was a ring
Then you told me that you loved me
More than anything in your life
So I asked you would you do me
The honor of being my wife

(yes I will)
I will be your man
Your protector, your best friend
till my humble life is ended
And time begins again, couldnt we
