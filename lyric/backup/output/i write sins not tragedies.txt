Oh, well imagine
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
"What a beautiful wedding
What a beautiful wedding," says a bridesmaid to a waiter
"Oh yes, but what a shame

What a shame the poor groom's bride is a WHORE

I chime in with "Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?"
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
