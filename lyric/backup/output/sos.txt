La la la la la la la la la la la Oh
You know I never felt like this before (Oh oh)
La la la la la la la la la la la Oh
This feels like so real (Oh oh)

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up, and I'm aggressive just one thought of closing up
You got me stressing incessantly pressing the issue, 'cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course's the answer, just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken I'm never mistaken, but I can't control myself got me calling out for help
S.O.S. Please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this Y.O.U (Why Oh You) are making this hard?
I can't take it, see it don't feel right
S.O.S. Please someone help me
