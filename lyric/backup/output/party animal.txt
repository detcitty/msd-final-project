There's a light in the window
Someone open up the door
'Cause I'm ready to get down to it
There's a full moon a-risin'
There's a beat in the street
Got the fever and I just can't seem to lose it
I'll take my chances
Just a little bit of room to move
And I'll be dancin'

I'm a party animal, animal
I'm a hungry animal
Feed me with music, women and wine
I'm a party animal, animal
