Honey honey how you thrill me a ha
Honey honey
Honey honey nearly kill me a ha
Honey honey

I heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
Ooh you make me dizzy

Honey honey let me feel it a ha
Honey honey
Honey honey don't conceal it a ha
Honey honey
