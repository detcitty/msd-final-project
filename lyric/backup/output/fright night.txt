Fright (fright, fright, fright)
Night (night, night, night)
Fright (fright, fright, fright)
Night (night, night, night)

People say i'm crazy and i make no sense
But they don't understand the man's got influence
He's a gigolo, a liar, a man of many faces
So don't be fooled by what you think you see
He's gonna make his move on you and me

Fright night (fright night)
Who's it gonna be tonight
Lock your doors and windows tight
