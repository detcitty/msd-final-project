Lately there seems to be some insecurities
About the way I feel where I wanna be
Boy, you know it's with you
No one can do the things you do to me
Never to be mistaking, long as it's love we're making
There'll be no hesitating
You and me, an that's the way it will be
And I won't leave your side
Cause you know ...

Love will be right here
Be right here, right here
Be right Here
(Dont't you have no)No fears, have (no fear)no fear
