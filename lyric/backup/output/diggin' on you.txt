I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there so was I
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my kool aid
When Miss Chilli came to rely
That you had a thang for me
Finest thang you'd ever seen

I must admit to you
I've heard those lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on so I am

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooo baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

Diggin' the scene
Diggin' on you
Diggin' on me
Baby baby ooo baby baby
It's on like that
It's on like that
