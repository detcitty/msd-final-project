Whachu say your name was?
Well um, lookin' real sexy right now
You and your girls, are lookin' good
Look why don't y'all take off y'all jackets
What's your name baby? Word? Okay
Tell your friend right there this, this my man Busta

So what if I said it baby I'm still gon' tell ya

I hope your ass bigger than Wilona and Thelma
Listen, it's Busta Rhymes bitch I ain't never fail ya
Your ass all over like paraphernalia, hmm

For walking around wit the kind of ass that'll kill ya now
Don't worry bout it I got money to bill ya
Shorty stacking like a mule, type of shit that'll scare ya
Headboard bang, bump the side of ya head

Watch how ya ass spread spill all off the side of the bed now, hmm

Move girl like your ass on fire, like your ass on fire
