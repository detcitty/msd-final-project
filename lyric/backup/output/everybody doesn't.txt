Everybody does it
That's what you keep saying

Everybody doesn't
Not everybody's playing
I want to be your girlfriend
But you gotta turn the pressure off
Just stop

I think you've got
A one track mind
You're so focused on the destination

That you're missing the ride
You tell me
You're a patient guy
But we're not having conversations
'Cause you're preoccupied

If I loved you, I would
If you loved me I wouldn't have to
If I were in your shoes
Never expect you to get down

Everybody does it
That's what you keep saying
Everybody doesn't
Not everybody's playing
I want to be your girlfriend
But you gotta turn the pressure off
Everybody does it
