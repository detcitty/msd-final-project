I heard from a friend of a friend of a friend that
You finally got rid of that girlfriend
You finally came out of that love coma, boy

I heard Mary Jane at the Powder Puff Beauty Shop
Sayin' that blonde in her tube top
She left our Jimmy for a boy in Illinois

Someone give me an amen
Someone give me an amen

Can I get a thank God, hallelujah?
You finally saw what she was doing to ya
Your mama called it, she was right
