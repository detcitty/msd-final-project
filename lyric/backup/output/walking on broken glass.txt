Walking on Walking on broken glass
Walking on Walking on Broken Glass
You were the sweetest thing that I ever knew
But I don't care for sugar honey if I can't have you.
Since you've abandoned me
My whole life has crashed
Won't you pick the pieces up
'Cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass...
(Walking on walking on broken glass)
