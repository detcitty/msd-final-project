It's got to be you

Standing here in my correspondent shoes
I don't need no place to go
Sometimes I feel like making other plans
Should I stay here, I don't know

I've an idea, the world is just a stage
It's not original but I call it mine
We are all actors, actors everyone
Making entrances, learning lines
