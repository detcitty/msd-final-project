I stepped out into the blue
Felt the wind hit my face
Before my shoot opened I felt my heart race
I was fallin
Oh that's just fallin

Off the coast of australia
I dove way down deep
For all that I saw of that Great Barrier Reef
It was nothin
Compared to you it was nothin

[Chorus]
I got Lightning in my vains
thunder in my chest.
