Honey, why you calling me so late?
It's kind of hard to talk right now
Honey, why you crying? Is everything OK?
I got to whisper 'cause I can't be too loud

Oh well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes, I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
