I heard Your song on the radio
It stole my heart and it won't let go
I'm telling You it was so unreal
You know exactly how I feel

It said that You were the Only One
Who understood where I was coming from
You put me together and You tore me apart
You told me the truth about my broken heart


And, I can't (I can't)
Get You outta my
I can't (I can't)
Get You outta my
I can't (I can't)
Get You outta my mind


All of my friends say I'm going mad
