I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup

Pour me some more
So I can go until i blow up, eh
And I can drink until i throw up, eh
And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh

I want to keep it going, keep keep it going, going, going, going...
I got a little bit trashed last night, night
I got a little bit wasted, yeah yeah
I got a little bit mashed last night, night

I got a little shhh faced it, yeah yeah
I'm on the roof
If you don't know
