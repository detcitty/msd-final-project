All right, yeah
Make the sound of peace
And sing now

(Stop the war) ow (now)
Everybody
Don't put it off another day
Make your voices roar

(Stop the war) ow (now)
Just like thunder, y'all
(Don't put it off) hey, another day
Sing a song now

(Stop the war) ow (now)
Listen to me, y'all
(Don't put it off) ow, another day
Listen to me

A knock on the door
There's a letter from the war
Sayin', greetings, we want you
If I refuse to fight
They say that that ain't right
And time you'll have to do

Somebody please tell me
What is war all about
And why must I kill against my will
I just can't figure it out

Oh, stop the war now
Good God, hear me saying
Don't put it off another day
Everybody saying
