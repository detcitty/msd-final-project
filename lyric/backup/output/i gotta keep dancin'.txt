Keep on dancing
Do do do, yeah, yeah, yeah

Keep on smiling
Do do do, yeah, yeah, yeah

Keep on dancing
Do do do, yeah, yeah, yeah

Keep on smiling
Do do do, yeah, yeah, yeah

Body began to spin'
Please help me pretend
That I don't see
Who just walked in the door

I'm weak in the knees
But I gotta make believe
That I'm hurt free
I just can't let him know
