Da da da da

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
be with myself and center clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
