I got all these J's rolled up

And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I'm tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends, woah
I got all these J's rolled up

And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I'm tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends, woah

You and your friends, up in my car
