(Magoo)
See, them other crews could not figure me
It's the Mag and double-ooh, got that fat CD
Buck a crystal, hit a nigga with my blunt Philly
Fake MC's getting assed like they eatin chili
Only way they seem to rap is if they got a Philly
Maybe I'm Nicole Brown, cause you really kill me
Got away with hittin me, but you ain't O.J.
I'm bout to shake up the world like Cassius Clay
When I bumble watch your back cause I sting like bee
This ain't the Wild Wild West and you ain't Kool Moe Dee
Watch a movie now you think that you really Joe Pesci
You don't want beef with me, like a diaper I'm messy

(Timbaland)
I'm that laid back brother they call Timbaland
I drive a 850 sometimes a 3-2 Mazda van
You can catch me standin in my b-boy stance
Or catch me at home watchin Who's the Man?
