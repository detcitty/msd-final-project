I can still remember when I bought my first Guitar
Remember just how good the feeling was put it proudly in my car
And my family listened fifty times to my two-song-repertoire
And I told my mam her only son was gonna be a star.
I bought all the Beatle-records sounded just like Paul
I bought all the old Chuck Berries 78's and all.
I sat by my record-player playing ev'ry note they played
Now watched them all on TV copied ev'ry move they made.

Oh, Rockn' roll I gave you all the best years of my life
All the dreamy sunny sundays all the moonlit summer nights
I was so busy in the back-room writing love-songs to you
