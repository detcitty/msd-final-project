Winter froze the river
And winter birds don't sing
So winter makes you shiver
So time is gonna bring you spring
So he swears he'll never marry
Says that cuddles are a curse
Just tellhim plain
You're on the next train
If love don't get there first
Time and love
Everybody
Time and love
Nothing cures like
Time and love
Don't let the devil fool you
Here comes a dove
