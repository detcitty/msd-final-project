Back on the road again
Feeling kinda lonely
And looking for the right guy
To be mine
Friends say I'm crazy cause
Easily I fall in love
You gotta do it different J
This time
Maybe we'll meet at a bar
He'll drive a funky car
Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
He'll tell me I'm the one
And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of his dreams (maybe)
Alright baby come on
dance my way i gotta
get some one
to call my lover
yeah! baby come on
Yeah baby come on
Alright baby come in
Pass my way
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah baby come on
I-YI-I-YI-I-YI-I-YI-I-YI-I-YI-I-YI
I-I-I-I
I-YI-I-YI-I-YI-I-YI-I-YI-I-YI-I-YI
I-I-I-I
I spoil them when I'm in love
Given them what they dream of
Sometimes it's not a good thing
But I'm blind
I love hard with everything
Giving my all
More than they
I'll take my friends' advice this time
I'll do it differently
Maybe we'll meet at a bar
