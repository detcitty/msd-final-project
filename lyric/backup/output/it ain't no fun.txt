When it's getting late
I guess you'll soon be coming home, yeah
We'll sit and talk and you'll pretend
That your love for me is gone, well

You act as though I'm just a friend
A quick hello and you'll be down
You'll be down again, oh

But it ain't no fun
Being in love all by yourself
I tell you it ain't much fun
When the one you love loves someone else
And I love you

Sometimes you say sweet things
To make me think you care
Don't you do that, baby
But tell me how can you give love
When no love, when no love is there

I wish I knew the words to say
To save the love that's slipping away
Away from me
