I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit, I've been hit by your love
I've been hit

I've been hit by your love and it's all that I see
So much happiness now belongs to me
I've been hit by your love for the very first time
And I know you're the one, baby you're mine

It turns out that we like the same movies
We even like the same songs, baby
I can't believe that there is someone like you
I can't believe I waited so long

What we have is something so special
A connection I hope won't be broken too soon
I just need you to tell me you love me
So I can be with you
