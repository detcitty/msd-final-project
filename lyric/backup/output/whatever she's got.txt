She's a little complicated
She'll make her mind up just to change it
The kind of girl that keeps you waitin', waitin' around
She likes to get her toes done bright red
She's always reapplying her lipstick
The muddy river bank she's the first in and last out
She's got something I can't figure out
That everybody's talking about

She's got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
She's sunny one minute then she's pouring down rain.
And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
