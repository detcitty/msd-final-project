Burn slow (Get back up from a trap nap)
Burn slow, burn slow
(I'm burning slow right now)
Burn slow
(I'm at the end of the inscent)
Burn slow, burn slow
(Niggas ain't got kids)
Burn slow, burn slow

Nobody open the door
Homie I blow by the "O"
Burning it down, good shit is all that I know
I done had all that before
Shawty a pro, told her get down on the floor
She take it all in her throat
She wanna go, smell the weed all in my clothes
