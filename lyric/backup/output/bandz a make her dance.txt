Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance

Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussy
I'm just popping bands
Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
These chicks clappin'
And they ain't using hands

Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussy
I'm just popping bands
Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
These chicks clappin'
And they ain't using hands

Short hair like Nia Long
Loose one she don't need a loan
She start twerking when she hear a song
The stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some
So nasty when she rolling
She put that ass off in my hands
I remote control it
She give me dome when the roof gone
At the K.O.D. she leave with me
She got friends bring three
I got drugs I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gone poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy Juicy J can't
Racks everywhere, they're showing racks I'm throwing racks
