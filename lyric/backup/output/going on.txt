I've seen it with my own eyes
How we're gettin' otherwise
Without the luxury of leavin' (of leavin')

The touch and feeling of free
Is intangible technically
Something you've got to believe in (believe in)

Connect the cause and effect
One foot in front of the next
This is the start of a journey (a journey)

And my mind is already gone
And that there're other unknowns
