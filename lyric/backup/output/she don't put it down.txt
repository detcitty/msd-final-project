She ain’t got a leg to stand on
Don’t even trip

I can take you all over the world though, even tell you pack light
The last lad couldn’t even get a cab ride
She don’t do the blogs, but if she did, she’d be on mad sites
Ass so mean that I’m always on her bad side
Uh, now she don’t ever stress me ’bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned with other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers, it’s my turn, that shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me, why I’m always tryna wear her out
She don’t ride like you, no she don’t taste like that
Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that?
She a mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick, uh
And I’m telling y’all straight up
Might think I imagined shorty even when she not made up
She kill ‘em in Levi’s, see why, it ain’t even fair
Look good in whatever she wear, how could other women compare
They can’t

I done put another in your space
Damn if they do, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know
She don’t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
