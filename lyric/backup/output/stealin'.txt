Take me across the water 'cause I need some place to hide.
I done the rancher's daughter and I sure did hurt his pride.

Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah
Oo-oo oo-oo ah ah ah.

Well, there's a hundred miles of desert lies between his hide and mine.
I don't need no food, no water, Lord, 'cause I'm running out of time.

Fightin', killin', wine and women gonna put me to my grave.
