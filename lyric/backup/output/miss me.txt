I said tell me what's really going on
Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm bout my paper like a muthafucking scratch and win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife
Your bitch is as hot as ice
Everytime you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got 'em right)
Yeah I got 'em Bun
I love myself because I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire she should work tonight
Call her King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
Work something, twerk something, basis
She just tyna make it,
so she's right here getting naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her
but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper
and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz,
can you keep up?
I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stands for
"Do Right And Kill Everything"
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one we get married just to say
