I knew I needed moral support
Somebody who could last
I've had my share of love as a sport
Waiting in line too long to save the best

I'm a jealous guy
I'm insecure
But I've got what
I've been looking for

One love, just one love
Makes me happy, so happy
One love, just one love
Makes me happy, so happy
