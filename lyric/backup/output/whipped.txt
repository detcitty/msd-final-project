I'm a man, I'm a man such a loving man
Understand that I'm strong and I know I belong
That's why there's no way you can say what you say
Without feeling that way I got to go away
Got to go away ain't playing swaying
I ain't making no waves make no promises
There's no second best more or less win or lose
I'm looking for the truth, looking for the truth yea.

It's the real thing
Just what love can bring.

Be whipped from the outside
Be whipped from the inside
Be whipped from the outside
Whipped from the inside looking for something
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Know what I want.

It's a shame, it's a shame must get out of this shell
