Chorus:
Don't say what you won't do
You know you'll be the first one
To go on through yes you will
Don't say what you won't do
You know you'll be the first one
To go on through yes you will

I know you mean well
But looking at you one can't tell
You've got changes to make
Cause the why you treat me girl
Just ain't right
Always fronting on someone
But never think about the damage you've done
