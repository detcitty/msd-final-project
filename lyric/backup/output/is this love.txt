I wanna love you and treat you right; 
I wanna love you every day and every night:
We'll be together with a roof right over our heads; 
We'll share the shelter of my single bed; 
We'll share the same room, yeah! - for Jah provide the bread.
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love - is this love - is this love -
