It's such a small town rodeo
Such famous people here with nowhere to go
Well, it don't get to me, I think it's the pits
I got no friends, I wanna split

The daily papers seek a desperate face
The television cameras join in the chase
It's much fun interviewing urban decay
I grab the microphone away

(Dance)
No
(Dance)
No

(Dance)
No
(Dance)
No

We gotta get out of here
We gotta get out of here right now
We gotta get out of here
We gotta get out of here right now
