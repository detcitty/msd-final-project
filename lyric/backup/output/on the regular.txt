Sell a lot of dope
Dodge a lot of cases
Stickin' to the basics
Rock a lot of chains
Do a lot of things
Bottles by the cases
Stickin' to the basics
Do it on the regular
Fuckin' on the regular
Drippin' on the regular
Trippin' on the regular
Count it on the regular
Sippin' on the regular
Never smokin' regular
Nigga we ain't regular

I'm out LA for a week, I'm out here playin' for keeps, yea, yea
I never play in them Jeeps, double R back of the seat, yea, yea
I'm out here lookin' like Meech, flooded the Patek Philippe, yea, yea
Bookies all up in the piece, we got the key to the streets, oh Lord
Remember they said I was done done
Fuck that they ain't know I'm the one one
We get your chain and its one one
I tell my nigga I want one
I tell my nigga to get it back
He in the field 'bout to punt somethin'
