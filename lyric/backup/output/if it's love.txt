While everybody else is getting out of bed
I'm usually getting in it
I'm not in it to win it
And there's a thousand ways you can skin it
My feet have been on the floor
Flat like an Idol singer
Remember Winger? I digress
I confess you are the best thing in my life
But I'm afraid when I hear stories about husband and wife
There's no happy endings, no Henry Lee
But you are the greatest thing about me

If it's love
And we decide that it's forever
No one else could do it better
If it's love
And we're 2 birds of a feather
Then the rest is just whatever

And if I'm addicted to loving you
And you're addicted to my love too
We can be them 2 birds of a feather
That flock together

Love, love
