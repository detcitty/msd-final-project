I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch!
What a catch!
Whoa

You'll never catch us so just let me be
Said I'll be fine 'til the hospital or American embassy
Ms. Flack, said I still want you back
Yeah, Ms. Flack, said I still want you back

I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch!
What a catch!
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you
