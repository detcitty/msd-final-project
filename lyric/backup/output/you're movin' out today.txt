I stayed out late one night and you moved in.
I didn't mind 'cause of the state you were in.
May I remind you that it's been a year since then?

Today the landlady, she said to me,
"You're loony friend just made a pass at me."
Perhaps you might enjoy a cottage by the sea.

So pack your toys away,
your pretty boys away,
your forty-fives away,
your alibis away,
