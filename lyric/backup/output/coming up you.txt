How could they leave you standing?
Holding on to the air
With never a hope of landing
Didn't they know you cared

An' you're findin' out
It's never quite like it seems
You're findin' out
It's never quite like it dreams

Didn't you get connected
When things were still upside down?
Feeling somewhat neglected
Turning the tide around
