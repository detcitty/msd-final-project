The radio and a sundress
Makin' my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and the truth spin
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers
Sing every word of Night Moves
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years, once disappeared
Makes time stall
wanna be those words
that fill you up, roll your windows down
and keeps you young
makes you believe you're right where you belong
i wanna be that song
i wanna be wanna be wanna be wanna be that song
