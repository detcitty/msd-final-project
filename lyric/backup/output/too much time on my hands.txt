Yeah, I'm sittin' on this barstool
Talkin' like a damn fool
Got the twelve o'clock news blues
And I've given up hope
On the afternoon soaps
And a bottle of cold brew
Is it any wonder I'm not crazy
Is it any wonder I'm sane at all
Well I'm so tired of losin'
I got nothin' to do
With all day to do it
Well I'd go out cruisin'
But I've no place to go
And all night to get there
Is it any wonder I'm not a criminal
Is it any wonder I'm not in jail
Is it any wonder I've got
