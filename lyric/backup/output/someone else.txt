If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door, without me
If you're trying to find pity then you need to look somewhere else
Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else
I used to believe the comfort

That's what seen in movies
Come to find out it's not like that at all
You see real life's much different
I don't want to see you go

Only want to see you smile
It hurts so much just thinking of
Felt like this for awhile
