Yo, oh, ya boy Jim Johnson big daddy
Mmm, mmm

Baby, when I touch her she like, ooh
When I hug her, ooh
When I rub her she like, ooh
When we cut it's like, ooh
Then she got me sayin', girl tonite

Baby, when I touch her she like, ooh
When I hug her, ooh
When I rub her she like, ooh
When we cut it's like, ooh
Then she got me sayin', girl tonite

It's getting late lil' mama, we been in the club too long
Let me take you out to my home
Tell me what a nigga gotta do to get you out that thong
When are you really gonna make up your mind shorty?
See Twista work that stick, now can I get in it from behind shorty?
Show you what I'm working with, ooh

Come on let me take you to the penthouse suite
Pull out some old school Marvin Gaye and put it on repeat
Shorty come and show me you can take it boo
Let me fuck you first, now girl show me what you can do

Come and fuck me renow, girl doin' thangs that will get you gone
Put me on the couch, I can make you moan, eat you up
When we in the kitchen let you get on top when we ride the stove
