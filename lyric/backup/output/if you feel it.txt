There's an overtone, I can feel it
When you're near me, that's so appealing
You're always makin' my imagination
Think about you, infascination
Don't wanna be alone here thinkin' 'bout the two of us
You've got to tell me if this tendency is amorous
Magnetic fields are pulling me in your direction
And if you take me there, I'll make you no objection

Don't hesitate, If you feel it, If you feel it
My love can wait, If you feel it, If you feel it
Just let it be, If you feel it, If you feel it
Take all of me, If you feel it, If you feel it
