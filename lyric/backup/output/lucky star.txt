You must be my lucky star
'Cause you shine on me wherever you are
I just think of you and I start to glow
And I need your light and baby you know

Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright, make everything all right
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright, yeah

You must be my lucky star
'Cause you make the darkness seem so far
And when I'm lost you'll be my guide
I just turn around and you're by my side

Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright, make everything all right
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
