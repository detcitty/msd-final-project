One thing I would love to do
Is talk to someone
Wish I knew who
Sometimes the people who know the least say the most
Makes you wonder who you can trust
What's gonna happen

The first thing I know
God is love
The next thing would be
He loves me
Sometimes I'm tired of waiting for a thing or someone
Then I stop and see what He's done
And I know everything will come

And it maybe today
