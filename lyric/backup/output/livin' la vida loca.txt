She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
Well, I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got new addictions
For every day and night
She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life

But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color mocha
