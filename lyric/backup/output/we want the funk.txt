Excuse me, where have I seen you?
They tend to ask me
A humble answer I give them
As we start to get closer
But then even more so
They all persist on rubbing my torso
Im Latin but I aint wrapping in satin
No, that old disco look just aint happening
Im fresh and new and making my debut
So let me run this information by you
Its true we outdo, it has become an issue
Love em and leave em fast we wont miss you
Its tradition were well conditioned
We outlast the competition, so listen
We dont care too much about kissing
No, we know just what youve been missing
Were straight out and blunt
We dont put up with stunts
Baby, you know what we want

We want the funk
Give up the funk
