This is it
It's time for you to go to the wire
You will hit
'Cuz you got the burnin' desire

It's your time
(Time)
You got the horn so why don't you blow it?
You are fine
(Fine)
You're filthy cute and baby you know it

Ooh
Cream, get on top
Cream, you will cop
Cream, don't you stop
Cream, sh-boogie bop

You're so good
Baby there ain't nobody better
