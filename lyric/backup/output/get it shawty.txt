I guess I can let this woman slip away
Cause I got my eye on you
I see ya lookin' over your shoulder
Let me make my way over
Excuse me miss lady, how ya doin'
your body lookin' right
your're type I like
and, I'm pursuin'
so can I get a little closer
so I can get to know you and exchange names and thangs
before the night is over, uh

All I really want is
for you to back it up
go on and put your weight on it
cause it's alright
do what you wanna
make me believe ya
ooh I wanna see ya

Get it shawty
get it shawty
get it shawty
Get it shawty
get it shawty
get it shawty

I guess if I can let the night just drift away
so baby whatcha gon' do?
Cause I don't wanna lose it
come on keep it movin'
excuse me miss lady, how ya doin'
Your body lookin' right,
