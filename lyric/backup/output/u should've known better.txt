Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
La la, da da da daaa, oh, oh
Oh
I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping spree
in LA or Melrose, boy if you didn't know it

Well now you know, I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I have been holding us down on my own, and no
I never, ever cheated

I never, ever lied
So you can stop asking me, asking me why?
