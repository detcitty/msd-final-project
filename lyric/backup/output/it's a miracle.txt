Wouldn't believe where I've been
The cities and towns I've been in
From Boston to Denver and every town in between
(everyone looks the same)

The people they all look the same (yes the same)
Oh, only the names have been changed (just the names)
But now that I'm home again
I'll tell you what I believe
It's a miracle (miracle)

A true blue spectacle the miracle come true
(whoa oh-oh-oh...)

We're together baby I was going crazy
Till the miracle came through
(whoa oh-oh-oh...)
Now you're here and my arms are around you
