All we do right is make love
We both know now it ain't enough
Ain't gonna beg you to stay
God I ask you where's from
Ain't no reason running for something is already gone
Take up your leave in dress
Let's do what we do best
I guess everybody's got a way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
