I know I may be young but
I've got feelings too
and I need to do
what I feel like doing
so let me go and just listen.

All you people look at me
like I'm a little girl,
well did you ever think it'd be okay
for me to step into in this world.

Always saying: "little girl,
don't step into the club"
well I'm just tryin' to find out why
'cause dancing's what I love.

Get it, get it, whoa!
get it, get it, whoa!
get it, get it, whoa!

I know I may come off quiet
may come off shy
but I feel like talking feel like dancing when I see this guy.

What's practical is logical,
what the hell, who cares
all I know is I'm so happy
when you're dancing there.

I'm a slave for you...
I cannot hold it,
I cannot control it;
I'm a slave for you...
