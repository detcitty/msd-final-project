Ah, it's jumpin' off in H-Town, baby
He he he
Strictly for the funk lovers
Give it to me

And we really want the whole world to see
How it goes
We want your mind to blow, baby
When you free your mind and let it float

Let me roll
We want your mind to blow
Just let us hang with you

Hangin' in the hood, just shootin' the breeze
My partners on the cut smokin' swisher sweets
Trippin' on the hoochies, rollin' by in they rides
Guzzlin' up a forty ounce of cold St. Ides

Jammin' to a tape to my partner had made
Growin' up in the Hood' bein' mixed with Face
Swisher sweet's a killer, feelin' nothin' but nice
Reached in my pocket for the old school dice

Pulled out a knot and dropped the dice on the flo'
And asked my partner Mike what they hittin' fo'
Pulled out a yard and said, "We bettin' a dove"
Tee Lee Baby, show your partner some love

Kickin' back fadin', put the flame to the joint
3-2, drop baby, 3-2's your point
