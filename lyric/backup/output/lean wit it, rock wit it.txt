Lean wit it, rock wit it!
Lean wit it, rock wit it,
Lean wit it, rock wit it,
Lean wit it, rock wit it,
Lean wit it, rock wit it,
Lean wit it, rock wit it,
Lean wit it, rock wit it,
Lean wit it, rock wit it!
I bounce in the club so the ho's call me Rocky,
Posted in the cut, and I'm lookin for a blockhead,
Yup in my white tee! I break a bitch back,
And I keep a big bank, oh I think dey like dat!
Before I leave the house, I'm slizzard on a goose,
And I'm higher then a plane, so a nigga really loose,
And I can lean wit it, and I can rock wit it,
And if u gotta friend, she gotta suck a cock wit it!
Ay gon n rock wit it, gon n lean wit it,
Rock so damn hard, u break your spleen wit it,
Pull up ya jeans wit it, smoke some green wit it,
N da spot aint crunk? bitch if we ain't in it?
If you don't wanna do it, then i'll make ya dance,
Perfect example watch me make your face beat up my hands,
