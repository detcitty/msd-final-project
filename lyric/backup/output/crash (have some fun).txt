With Michelle Visage

Crash here I go, watch the flash
Light as it shines, Bright in the Nite
Rhymes I recite, rhymes that you might
Like, maybe not, in fact I don't really care
So I just came here to get you hyped
I'm like fire, get your body filled with
Desire, start to dance! 

(CHORUS)
All together-lets just party
All together-lets have some fun
Knocks me off my feet
Makes me want to get down
