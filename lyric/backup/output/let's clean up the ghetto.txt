You know I was in New York City a few months ago
And the garbage and the trash men were on strike
I'm tellin', the maintenance people of the city
What they were tryin' to do was
They were tryin' to get a little more money
You know, get a little raise in pay
But at that particular time the city was broke
They were about ready to declare default
I tell you, the garbage in some places
Was stacked up two, three stories high
At night, ha ha, boy, at night it weren't even safe to walk the street
'Cause they caught the rats, the roaches and the water bugs
I mean they were hustlin', baby, tryin' to get somethin' to eat, see?
And let met tell you somethin' it was stinkin'
And it was all kind of diseases in there, you know?
But it only brought to mind the fact that
You can no longer depend on the man downtown
To take your business like he's supposed to
When he's supposed to
If all of us would get it like it's supposed to be
As far as cleanliness, you know and safety
We gotta get together and do it for ourselves
