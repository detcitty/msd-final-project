She came down from Cincinatti
It took her three days on a train
Looking for some peace and quiet
Hoped to see the sun again
But now she lives down by the ocean
She's taking care to look for sharks
They hang out in the local bars
And they feed right after dark

Can't you feel them circling, honey?
Can't you feel them swimming around?
