You're not the type, type of girl to remain
With the guy, with the guy
Too shy, too afraid to say, he'll give his heart to you forever
I'm not the boy that will fall to his knees

With his hands clasped tight
Begging, begging you please
To stay with him for worse or for better
But I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl for me

I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can live like this forever

It's fine by me
