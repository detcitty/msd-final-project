He left me cryin' late one Sunday night
Outside of Boulder
He said he had to find himself
Out on the road
I guess when love goes wrong
You've gotta learn to be strong
So I worked two jobs and I moved three times
I ended up south of Memphis
Workin' down in Riverside
I may not be so lucky in love
But the one thing I'm sure of
