Virgil Spencer's got a 19 inch Hitachi
And many demons lingering
Friday night, he pulled a gun to change the channel
Something that he picked up from the King
His wife remembers well the man she knew
Seems the dreams she had have all turned black and blue
She's wasted years
No time for tears

'Cause there's another chance
A someday soon
Shining like the Alabama moon
She's looking for the promised land
Out beyond the lights of Birmingham
