Because you right
You are my type
Your my kinda girl
Yo teeth white
Yo smile bright
Enough to brighten up this world
To me your prettier than any super model
Paw yo love no bwoy cyaa put no value
Because you right
Just my type
Your my kinda girl
Oh, sweeter than the morning view in cherry gardens
From one of my houses
So I will come and give to you pretty roses
Show you what love is
