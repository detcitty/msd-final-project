Barbra
It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years

Donna
No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

Barbra
I always dreamed I'd find the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
I've loved,
I've loved

Both
Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear

Donna
If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it

Barbra
If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it

Donna
Tell him to just get out,

Barbra
Nothing left to talk about

Donna
Pack his raincoat show him out
