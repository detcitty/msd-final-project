First I rise, then I fall
Seems like you don't want
The love of this man at all

And it's sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine

Ooh, be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

So you say to yourself
