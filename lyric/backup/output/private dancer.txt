Well the men come in these places
and the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
and you don't ask their names
You don't think of them as human
You don't think of them at all
You keep your mind on the money
keeping your eyes on the wall

I'm your private dancer
a dancer for money
do what you want me to do
I'm your private dancer
a dancer for money
and any old music will do

I wanna make a million dollars

I wanna live out by the sea
