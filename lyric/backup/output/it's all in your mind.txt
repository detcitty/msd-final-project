I remember the first time
I got hurt by love
I thought I'd never get over that girl
Then mama called me to her side
And took her handkerchief and
Dried the tears from my eyes and said

[CHORUS]
It's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
You'll get over it
Just a matter of time
You'll find a girl to treat you right
