Yeah, boy, another ABC card
Coming from the playground
Take it straight back to the bricks
Yo, Chris, tell em what it is

Chilling cooler then a squeak
Kicking dirt on my sneakers
Suckers on the corner
Looking down at their beepers

They couldn't get a
Job or a nice home
So they wanna stay and
Wait for the pay-phone

Take JoJo
He's the youngest
Girls jock him cause
He's reverse dressed

Strolling through
The neighborhood
Sweating their brother
Trying to see why
He's doing good

Rolling through the park
Trying to make another hit
Little do they know
That soldier's legit

I'm not saying this
To put nobody down
This is what I see
At the playground, you know

Aww yeah
Another ABC smash
Gonna make you mad

Come on, come on everybody
And guess who's up next
Kick it

L-I-L D-A-V-E
Four feet, shorty of the crew
Just let me get on the mic
And show you what I can do
When I'm all alone
