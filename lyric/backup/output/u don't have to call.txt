Yo after tonight... Don't leave your girl around me
True playa for real ask my nigga Pharrell

Situations will arise, in our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations, with the guys, I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I, I, I, I, I... I loved U, you were my girl
U see I, I, I, I, I... Thought the world of U
but your so steady still leavin baby

U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
