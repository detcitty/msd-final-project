Mister 305!
(Flo-Rida and Lunch Money!)
Three Miami boys, you know what time it is...

Give me the greenlight, oh yeah
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time, let's go
What you waiting for you
You only got one life, one life
And we gon' live it up
Give me the greenlight, give it to me
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Give me the green light...!

I got the greenlight mami and you know what that means
That we could do anything, anything that you dream
I wanna make you ooh, ah, until you scream
And I practice what I preach, if you know what I mean
I'mma ride that mami, yeah I got the key and I'mma lock that mami
Yeah, we can roll and I'mma rock that mami
I do what I say and say what I mean, now let me jump in between
I'm getting loose in this thing, like OJ the Juice in this thing
Feeling like Left Eye, boy, I burn the roof in this thing
I got all the women getting naked, feeling like Luke in this thing
Think it's a game
Now I got the weed lit and the green right
All I need is mami for you to give me the greenlight
