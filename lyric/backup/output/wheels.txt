One,
Two,
Three,
Four
I know what you're thinkin'
We were goin' down
I can feel us sinkin'
Then I came around

And everyone I've loved before
Flashed before my eyes
And nothin' mattered anymore
I looked into the sky

Well I wanted something better, man
I wished for something new
And I wanted something beautiful
I wished for something true
