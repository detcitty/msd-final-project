My child arrived, just the other day.
He came to the world in the usual way.
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay.
He learned to walk, while I was away.
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew, he'd say
"I'm gonna be like you, dad. You know, I'm gonna be like you."
And the cats in the cradle, and the silver spoon.
Little boy blue and the man on the moon.
"When you coming home, dad?" "I don't know when,
but we'll get together then. You know we'll have a good time then."
My son turned ten just the other day.
