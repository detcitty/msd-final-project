All this wild wild love of ours
It can't be tamed, no
This wild wild love of ours
It can't be tamed, no
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of ours

Long live this wild wild love

Ladies and gentleman
You're looking at the new play boy
Who you?
That's right, Armando Christian Perez
And when it comes to that pretty little beauty cutie
Don't stop get it get it baby let me pay it
I got that wild love
Love to get wild dirty freaky nasty, yeah I said it
I'll make you lose your heart and your mind at the same time
Don't believe me? bet it
I'm obsessed with that wild love for sure
Even though it's a catch twenty-two
It's a gift and curse for sure
But baby you know that you love it too, that's why

You need it, you want it
