You got the power
To keep my fire a-burnin'
You got the power
To keep my wheels a-turnin'

You keep me hot, don't stop
Give me what you got, oh yeah
Turn on the juice, turn loose
Ain't that no excuse, oh no, no, no

You got the power
To keep my fire a-burnin'
You got the power
To keep my wheels a-turnin'
