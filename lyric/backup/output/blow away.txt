Day turned black, sky ripped apart
Rained for a year till it dampened my heart
Cracks and leaks, the floorboards caught rot
About to go down, I had almost forgot

All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
Blow away, blow away, blow away

All I got to do is to, to love you
All I got to be is, be happy
All it's got to take is some warmth to make it
