This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's makin' me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin' to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

Hey, pretty mama how you doin'?
Said I'm just in town for the weekend
Lookin' for a little trouble to get into
Baby tell me what you're drinkin'?
And I got you

Players wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm takin' off after I dance, oh yeah

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's makin' me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's makin' me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty
