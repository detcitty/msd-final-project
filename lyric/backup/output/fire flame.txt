Fire flame, flame, fire flame spitters
Fire flame, flame, fire flame spitters
Bitch, we the business, hundred million dollars
Bitch, we the business, hundred million dollars

Fire flame, flame, fire flame spitters
Fire flame, flame, fire flame spitters
Bitch, we the business, hundred million dollars
Bitch, we the business, hundred million dollars

Back on my block, nigga, gun up in my hand
Money out the ocean, nigga, landin' in the sand
Third war soldier, world wide general
Cash Money, Young Money, fire flame spitters

Hustle all the time in the middle of the block
The gun stay, the money off the top
We do it 'round the clock, bitch, we the business
Hundred million dollars, filthy 'bout my riches

Stunting on them niggas 'cause we shine big time
Flip another hundred, nigga, do it on the grind
Bitches love a nigga 'cause they know we stay fly
Ride 25 on a nigga beehive
