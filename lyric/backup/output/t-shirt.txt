Hey! Let me tell you now
Ooh, baby

Trying to decide, trying to decide
If I really wanna go out tonight
I never used to go out without ya
Not sure I remember how to

Gonna be late, gonna be late
But all my girls gon' have to wait
'Cause I don't know if I like my outfit
I tried everything in my closet

Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choo's
Taking them off 'cause I feel a fool
Trying to dress up when I'm missing you

I'ma step out of this lingerie
Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
In bed I lay, with nothing but your t-shirt on, ooh
With nothing but your t-shirt on, hey

Gotta be strong, gotta be strong
But I'm really hurting now that you're gone
