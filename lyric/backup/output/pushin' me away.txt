Run, run like you do
I'm chasin' you
I'm on your tail
I'm gaining fast
You're going nowhere

Try, to fix what you've done
Turn back the sun
The night is calling and we're falling faster now

Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
