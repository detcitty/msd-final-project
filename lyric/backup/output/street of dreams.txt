I heard the sound of voices in the night
Spellbound there was someone calling
I looked around no one was in sight
Pulled down and I kept on falling

I've seen this place before
And you were standing by my side
I've seen your face before tonight
Maybe I just see what I want it to be
I know it's a mystery

Do you remember me
On a street of dreams
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams
