Street fighting is looking for trouble
If you open your mouth
You're bound to rumble
Johnny looks tough
He's froze in the eyes
He keeps his mouth shut
He don't tell no lies

Johnny went out last night
Got in a bar room fight
Embarrassed a jealous man
In front if his cheating wife
The man said "Tonight you won
But I'll tell you son,
This one's far from over"
Johnny said
