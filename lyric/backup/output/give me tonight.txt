Walking sadly through the park
I hear crying in the darkness
And thought I act like I cannot hear
The situation is very clear
A girl who's trying to tell her guy
The time has come that they say, "Goodbye"
And his answer tears my heart apart

Give me tonight
then if you don't wanna stay
Girl, I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
you won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you

Walking with you through the park
