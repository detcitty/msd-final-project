I've been driving all night, my hands wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head that drives my heel
It's my baby calling, says "I need you here"
And it's a half past four and I'm shifting gear

When she is lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
Don't need no phone at all

We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a wave in the air
