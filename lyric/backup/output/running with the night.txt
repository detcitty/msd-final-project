The heart of the city street was beating
Light from the neons turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out before the magic got away

We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I
'Til the morning light
(we were running)
Oh
(running with the night)

You were looking so good girl
