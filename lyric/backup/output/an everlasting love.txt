I've been here all your life watchin' your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world
And he was your sun and your rain

I was losin' you before I ever held you tight
Before you ever held me in your arms
And I won't make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do

Ah, we got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high above the rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need, it's the only show

And it's you want an everlasting dream
