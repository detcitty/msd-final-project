Just a small town Cinderella
Daddy wants you back home by midnight
every time we're together
Yeah, that's my delimma
I need more time with ya
I wanna watch the sun rise through the pines with ya
Night like this, wouldn't wanna miss
moonlight shining on a long slow kiss
You can be the one I can get lucky with
If the boot fits
Woah
Diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
like whoah
