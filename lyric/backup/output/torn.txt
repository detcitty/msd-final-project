I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, He came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry

Well You couldn't be that man that I adored
You don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for
I don't know him anymore

There's nothin' where he used to lie
Our conversation has run dry
That's what's goin' on
Nothing's fine
I'm torn

I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
