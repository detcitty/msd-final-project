You say I sound silly when I laugh real loud
Talk about my day and you tune me out
You keep telling me lies to make things worse
But I don’t hear you
‘Cause I’m listening to his words
And he says I am beautiful
And when I fall
It don’t matter that I’m not perfect
I’m not alone
And in his eyes I’m so worth it
I’m worth every tear
And every scar
