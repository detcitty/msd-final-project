You ain't fooling me
Huh, huh, no, well
Well, well, yeah, ah, ah, ah,

Acting needy,
Loving money being greedy
(Yeah, yeah)

And you're lying
Ooh, cheating
You've got me crying
Ooh, baby girl

And you're taking (taking)
Giving nothing but shaking
(Shaking, shaking, shaking ain't nothing shaking baby)

And you're faking (faking)
Your love,
My heart is breaking, oh, yeah

(CHORUS)
Now tell me who's fooling who
You ain't fooling me
You're fooling you
