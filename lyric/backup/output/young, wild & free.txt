So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh, Uh huh
So what I keep ‘em rolled up
Saggin' my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my n-ggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean dont it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501′s jeans on and
roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with you b-tch smokin' grade A
Yeah, uh you know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I'm on the chase
Chevy, it's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
