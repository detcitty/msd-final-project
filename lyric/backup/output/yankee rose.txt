What?
Well, let me roll up on to the sidewalk and take a look, yes
Whoa! She's beautiful!
I'm talking about a Yankee Rose!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
And she looks wild, wild, wild, wild!

Are you ready for the new sensation?
Well, here's the shot heard 'round the world
All you back room boys salute when her flag unfurls
Well, guess who's back in circulation
Now, I don't know what you may have heard
But what I need right now's the original good time girl

She's a vision from coast to coast (Coast to coast)
Sea to shining sea (Sea to shining sea)
