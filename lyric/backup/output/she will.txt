Young Money, yeah!

I tell her "now goin pop that pussy for a real nigga
I already know that life is deep but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous but really I couldn't care less
I'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hair net
Devil on my shoulder, the lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around, comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drumset
I've been at the top for a while and I aint jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit

Now jump up on that dick and do a full split

She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and tell me "baby, its real"
And I say I aint doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
but here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't

Uh, but shit than again maybe she will
Yeah
