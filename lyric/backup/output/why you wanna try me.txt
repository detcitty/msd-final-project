Why you wanna try me, baby
Why you wanna do me this way (Oh, oh)
Why you wanna try me, baby
Why you wanna do me this way (Whoa)

So many nights, so many days, baby
I've been hurt by your love
I don't know why I still love you like I do, baby
But you're a star in my world

Oh, how you got down and lonely
Ooh, yeah, my heart is in your hands
I don't see why you won't let me
When you know I'll be your number one man, yeah

Why you wanna try me, baby
Why you wanna do me this way
