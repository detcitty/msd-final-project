Yes sir

Can I get more thrills?
You know you want some more girl, so come on
Can I get more thrills?
You know you want some more girl, so come on
Let's get blown, let's get blown

Looking at the ladies, all of them fly
I don't know which one I want dawn
I can't make up my mind, girl
So won't you make it easy on me
And take this drink, then hit this weed?
Two step wit me, let's slip to the dance floor
On and on and on and on we go

I'll dip you if you want me to
You see I really wanna get a little front wit you, bigidy bump wit you
A nigga wanna hump you and then just comfort you
And then I'll pop the top and lay you on the cot
And get you nice and hot
Yeah yeah, it's all to the real
We could do it like guy, c'mon girl let's chill
