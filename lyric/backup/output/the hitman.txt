Watch out for the Hitman
Watch out - watch out - watch out - watch out

Here we go back to a groove, back and forth to make you move
Get up to the funky music on the dance floor and just swing it
Tonight's the night for you to let it hang out
You get funky while I get the house
Now I know that you got soul, there it is, put the ace in the hole
Feel the vibe while the rhythm control you, I command you to get loose
Yeah, I know you like my style, grab a girl and get buck wild
Show me what you got while the noise is pumpin'
