She wakes up
She's leaving
She sets out so assured
That she can find
The life that she believes in

She's glad now
It's over
She never should of gotten so involved
At least that's what she told him

And it' ain't a Front Page Story
Won't even make the papers
Somebody breaks a heart in two
And it happens much too often
Won't ever make the headlines
Somebody's broken heart ain't new
