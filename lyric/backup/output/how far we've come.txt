Hello, hello, hello

I'm wakin' up at the start of the end of the world
But it's feeling just like every other morning before
Now I wonder what my life is gonna mean if it's gone

The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour and I
Started staring at the passengers and waving goodbye
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?

But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

Well I believe it all is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
