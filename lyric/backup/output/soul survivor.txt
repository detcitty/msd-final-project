Convict
Akon and Young Jeezy
Tryin' to take it easy
Only way to go
And So...

If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked possibly sittin' on a drop (Now)
'Cuz I'm a rida (Yeah)
I'm just a Soul Survivor (Yeah)

'Cuz er'body know the game don't stop
Tryin' to make it to the top for your ass get popped (Now)
If you a rida (Yeah)
Or just a Soul Survivor

(Let's get it) Tonight I can't sleep--we livin' in Hell (Yeah)
First they, give us the work then they throw us in jail (Ayy)
Road Trip ya--I'm trafficing in the white
Please Lord don't let me go to jail tonight (Yeah)
Who Me?? I'm a Soul Survivor
Ask about 'em in the street, the boy Jeez a rida (Jeez a rida)
A hundred grand on my wrist, yeah life sucks
Fuck the club, dawg, I rather count a million bucks (Ayy)

If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked possibly sittin' on a drop (Now)
