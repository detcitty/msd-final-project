I'm walking in darkness with no shadows
Tears fall in silence with no sound
I've got to let go of visions I've outgrown
Even I know
So let the rain come down

Bring down the moon
The mythic and mighty that fall when you lean
Bring down the moon

Building love on thin air and dreams
Perfect love is a desperate creed
And one that we all try to believe
So bring down the moon
