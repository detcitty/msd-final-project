Do you, do you, do you wanna be....


Do me a favor, pick me up, take me out later
Don't worry about no paper, 
cause I got much stacked up for nights like this
My life can get crazy, I deal with shit on the daily
But baby I'm thinking maybe, 
we could agree to work it out like this

I need you (you, oh) to give me your time 
(give me your time)
I need you (you, oh) to not wanna be mine

Are you down to be a distraction baby
But don't distract me
Let me ask you baby
Do you, do you, do you wanna be
A distraction baby
Do you, do you, do you wanna be
Yeah, yeah
Are you down to be a distraction baby
