I like girls

They like me

They look so good
In they seven jeans
So you to be the one

And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my ha uh my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar
You see I got this problem

I need help tryna solve it
Cause meeting after meeting and I'm still a cookie whore
You can hide them, I'mma find them, on the counter, in the closet
And I'll say I ain't do it with my face covered in chocolate

My girl be setting booby traps
