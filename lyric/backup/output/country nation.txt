We work in the factories and the fields
Assembly lines and coal mines and the steel mills
That's what we do but there's more than us than that
If you want to know who we are it son the logos of our caps

We're Mountaineers, volunteers
We're the tide that rolls, we're Seminoles
We're the herd the long steer
We drive Ford and Chevrolet
