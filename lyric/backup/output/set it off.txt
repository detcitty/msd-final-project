Kick ass
(Mmm hmm)
C'mon
(Uh huh, mm hmm)
Y'all boys don't know nuttin' 'bout me
(Mm hmm, uh huh)
Ya heard? Ladies and gentlemen

I'ma T.C. soldier, New Orleans stunna
If a bitch leave me, I'ma take everything from her
Leave while ya can, or ya mom will pick ya rum up
I'ma find me some new pussy and buy a Four-Runner

I walk with a limp, 'cause my nuts heavy
And I like it from the back so hold your butt steady
I know I got some big lips, but I ain't trippin'
And momma I love pussy, but I ain't lickin'
Now prepare yourself for a smooth dickin'
You don't want it girl? You don't know, what you missin'

I'm the baddest boss nigga walkin', you ain't heard?
I got a team of head busters waitin' to give 'em the word
I gotta few in the East Coast, a few in the West
Down-South to Mid-W, whattup to the rest
Can't forget about the ghetto where they strugglin' in debt
No matter what I do dawg, I love my set, ladies and gentlemen

Wodie, wassup, Wodette, wassup, Wodie, wassup
