I'm beside myself...
Cause I don't know... and you won't tell
Your distant world has somehow pulled me in
It's so surreal...
So out of time with you it feels
To give again...
But you don't need a thing

Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time
Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time
