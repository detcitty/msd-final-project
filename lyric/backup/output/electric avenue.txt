Boy...

Boy...
Now in the street there is violence
And - and a lots of work to be done
No place to hang out our washing

And - and i can't blame all on the sun
Oh no no
Oh no we gonna rock down to electric avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Oh we gonna rock it down to electric avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Workin' so hard like a soldier
Can't afford a thing on tv

Deep in my heart I am a warrior
