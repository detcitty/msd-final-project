Stand up like a solider baby
Yeah
I know you built like that
Gun it like holster baby

Show dem say you wicked like that
We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in

Tonight we let it all go free
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock in a dance
Mash it up, hot step in a dance
