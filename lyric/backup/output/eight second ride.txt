Come on

I said, "Hey girl, what's your name?
Haven't I seen you before?
I recognize them dark green eyes
When you walked through the door"

"Are you alone, or are you with someone?"
She said, "As a matter of fact I'm not"
So I took her hand, that's when it all began
And we headed towards the parking lot

And she said, "Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
'Cause I ain't never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high"
