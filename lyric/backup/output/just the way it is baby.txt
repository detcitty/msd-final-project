Do you remember once upon a time
When you were mine
The stars above were bright and new
I pulled them down for you
Just when I fell in love again
You said that all good things must end

Baby
That's just the way it is, baby
Whoah whoah
Baby
That's just the way it is, baby

I've never had a hand for solitaire
