We just heard of a brand new wave
And we heard it's here to stay
We'll have to wait and see if it's half of what they say
We heard he opened up a brand new door
Well you know that's what I'm lookin' for
We'll have to wait and see if it makes you scream for more

How do you like him so far?
How do you like his show?
How do you like the way he rocks and the way he rolls?
How do you like his image?
How do you like his style?
How do you like the way he looks and the way he smiles?

The kid is hot tonight
Whoa, so hot tonight
