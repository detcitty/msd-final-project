Check yes Juliet
Are you with me?
Rain is falling down on the sidewalk
I won't go until you come outside.

Check yes Juliet
Kill the limbo
I'll keep tossing rocks at your window
There's no turning back for us tonight.

Lace up your shoes
Ay Oh Ay Ohhh
Here's how we do

Run, baby, run
Don't ever look back.
They'll tear us apart
If you give them the chance.

Don't sell your heart.
Don't say we're not meant to be.
Run, baby, run.
