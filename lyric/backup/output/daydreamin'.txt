All day long I think of you
I can't even think of things to do
Wishin' all of my daydreams come true
Now, baby, what am I to do?

I think about yesterday
Somebody was talkin' to me
But I couldn't understand a word they said
Not that I was tryin' to be rude
But conversation couldn't make it through
The thoughts of love I had for you

Baby your face takes up my time
Because I can jus' see your face with mine
I try to change my thoughts; it's a waste of time
You keep my mind occupied
