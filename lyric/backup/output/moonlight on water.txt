What's going on
Down on the planet
What's going on
Inside your pretty head
What's life without a Mercedes
And the need to feel adrenaline rush
Is it better than
Moonlight on water
Is it better than
Sex on the beach
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us
it's not out of reach
I'm here for you
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
