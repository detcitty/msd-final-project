Hear me speak what's on my mind
Let me give this testimony
Reaffirm that you will find
That you are my one and only

No exception to this rule
I'm simple, but I'm no fool
I've got a witness
Happy to say
Every hour, every day

Every heartbeat
Bears your name
Loud and clear they stake my claim
My red blood runs true blue
And every heartbeat belongs to you
