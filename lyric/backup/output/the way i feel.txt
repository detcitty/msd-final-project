Love

Love

Love can come and go
You can change your mind
Many times
Say you just don't know

Giving my heart and my soul
Pleasure comes with pain
I'll be here forever
Don't break my heart again

Can't tell you the way that I feel tonight
(I need your lovin' and I)
Want you to hold me tight
Can't tell you why I feel the way I do
