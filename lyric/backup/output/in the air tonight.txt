I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment, for all my life Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord, Oh Lord
Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies
