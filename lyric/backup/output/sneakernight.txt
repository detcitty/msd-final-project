Put your sneakers on
Put your sneakers on
We're going dancing all night long

I've got somewhere to be
I want you to come with me
See I've put my sneakers on
Cause I'm gonna keep dancing
After they all go home

So are you ready?
Did you eat?
Do you have the energy?
Are you reloaded?
Are you able to stay on your feet?
Don't want you passing out
After a couple hours of beats
We're keep going
And going
