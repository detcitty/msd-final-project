Sweetheart, I can't stop thinking about you

You'll always be in my dreams
You'll always be in my dreams
You'll always be in my dreams

Never in my dreams
I thought I'd be with you
You're often on my mind
I'll always love you
When I close my eyes
just to see your face
I wish this were real
but I'm just dreaming
I can't believe that
