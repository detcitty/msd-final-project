I took the bad news standing up
Shrugged and poured myself
Another cup of coffee
Oh, you made good coffee

Too numb, too dumb to understand
You were really begging me to
Take command and make you stay
I just let you walk away

(CHORUS)
I'm just beginning to feel the pain
Clouds swelling up inside of me, Lord
And I think I'm gonna rain
Without my friends and my music
Lord, I would go insane

Like a dime in the pocket of a kid
There's a sad song
