We are here on the beach
Where a giant shark has
Just eaten a girl swimmer
Well, Mr. Jaws, how was it

'Dynomite'

And what did she say
When you grabbed her

'Please, Mr., please'

I know sharks are stupid
But what did you think when
You took that first bite

'How sweet it is'

Mr. Jaws, before you
Swim out to sea
Have you anything else to say

'Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends'

With me now is the local sheriff
Sheriff Brody, the shark
Wll be back for lunch
