I need time (time)
Love (love), joy (joy)
I need space (love)
I need me (action!)

Say hello to the girl that I am
You're gonna have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't wanna be so damn protected

There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say
What a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
