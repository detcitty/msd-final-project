Hey Billy
(Yeah)
I'm havin' a party
Wanna come?

(Nah, I don't think so, baby)
Come on!
It's gonna be lots of fun
(Nah)

(Oh baby)
I'm havin' me a party
(Well, I don't think I can come)
Uh, uh
This ain't just any kind of party

(Nah, I think I'll stay at home)
Ah, oh no
It's gonna be really, really hot

(It's startin' to sound good)
I'm gonna put you on the spot
(Baby, maybe I should)
There'll be lots of one on one
(I guess I could be there)
Come on and join the fun
(What should I wear?)

I'll tell you that it
It doesn't matter (Oh yeah)
What you wear
'Cause it's only gonna be
You and me there

Wooo!
