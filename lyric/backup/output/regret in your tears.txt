I just want the memories
I'm with you

Regret in your tears, now you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just want the memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase some with you
You

Look at you now, stuck in the background
Silence right now sounds so loud
Tried to let you go, you come back 'round
Look at you now, stuck in the background
Two seats in my two seater-er-er
Used to pull off on me, leave me hurt
Tryna front, but I know you do your dirt
Not nice, boy you know you do your dirt

Regret in your tears, now you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just want the memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase some with you
