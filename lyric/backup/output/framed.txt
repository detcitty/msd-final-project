I was sitting in the coffee shop
Just minding my own affair
When all of a sudden, this
Policeman caught me unaware

Said, is your name Pedro
I says, yeah, I guess so
Said, then come with me cause
You're the man we been looking for

I said, hey, man
I been framed
Hey, no, really, man
I was framed

Aw, I never do nothing wrong, man
But every time I get the blame
I been framed

They put me in the lineup
And let the bright lights shine
There was ten poor dudes like me
Standing in that line

I knew I was the victim
Of somebody's evil plan
When this scroungy looking dude
Came up and said, yeah
