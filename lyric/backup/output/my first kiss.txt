My first kiss went a little like this
And twist
And twist

Well my first kiss went a little like this
And twist
And twist

I said no more teachers
And no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers
Hoping that nobody looks
Lips like liquorish
Tongue like candy
Excuse me miss but can I get you out your panties?

In the back of the car
On the way to the bar
I got you on my list
At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way,
You know that I'd make her say
