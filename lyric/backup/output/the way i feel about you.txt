Day after day
Just thinking about you
I can't wait to see your smiling face
Could this be love
I'm feeling for you
I've never felt this way before

I made a wish upon a shooting star
And baby here you are, just you and me
That's the way it should be
My heart is waiting, it's an open door
Each day I'm gonna love you more
