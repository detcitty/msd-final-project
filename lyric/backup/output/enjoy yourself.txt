Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
You better enjoy yourself
You better enjoy yourself

You sittin' over there
Starin' into space
While people are dancin'
Dancin' all over the place

You shouldn't worry
About the things you can't control
Come on girl while the night is young
Why don't you make yourself race go

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself for me

Let's have some fun
