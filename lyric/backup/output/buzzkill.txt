You're like a screen flashing insufficient funds.
Cops knocking when the party's just begun.
You're a big rain cloud parked over my boat.
You're a cell phone splashing in my coffee cup.
A fumble on the one when my team was going up.
You're like brakes on my brain and all I know... 

You're a buzzkill every time you come around.
Those beers might as well have been poured out.
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
