Song: Selfish


(Intro & Chorus: John Legend) (Slum Village & Kanye West)
...calling (yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself I can't help it)
All my (yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my, ladies and I can't (maybe I'm selfish)
(I can't) Let you (let you)
(I want you to myself I can't help it)
Be with no one (yeah) but me (yeah) baby

(T3)
To my thick chicks down in Texas
All the way to New Orleans where da girls cook catfish
And in LA every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass to sell a lot of sex
And Hot Atlanta y'all is one of the best
Where they speak southern and slang and smoke la cess
And New York women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feelin myself too much I guess
But, to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes
