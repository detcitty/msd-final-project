Everybody won't you get on the floor
(Get on the floor and let the good time roll)
We got a kung fu bumpin' 'til it's time to go
(Get on the floor and let the good time roll)
Come on get down, get down
Grab your partner and dance to the beat
(Get on the floor and let the good time roll)
Let the music control your feet, now
(Get on the floor and let the good time roll)
Come on and party, baby
(Get down, get down)
Get down all night long
Baby, why don't ya
(Get down, get down)
Me and you
(Get down, get down)
I know you (have?) it
(Get down, get down)
Why don't you get on the floor and let the good time roll
Come on and let it roll
I feel the beat, I feel the heat
Everybody won't you clap your hands and dance
(Get on the floor and let the good time roll)
Come on
