oh! Happening all over again
I was such a fool
To think that you would
Ever change your way
Even put your hand
Upon your heart and
Said that no one else
Can take my place

How was I so blind
I trusted every single
Word you said
I know I should've seen
The light but I just let
Your love go to
My head

I've taken you back before
cause you told me you changed
looked in my eyes
(and said)...

Believe me than you
Broke my heart and
Decieved me when you said you
never could leave me but it's
Happening all over again
