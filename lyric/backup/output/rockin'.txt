People always talk about the ones that got away
I just seem to get the ones that always want to stay
I'm just too distracted with the life I'm tryna pay
Yeah, yeah, uh, oh yeah, yeah
Say, I got all these women too attracted to the fame
Not too many niggas that will end up in the way
Nothing's gonna stop me, I'ma get it either way
Yeah, yeah, uh, oh yeah, yeah

Why would you wanna take away from this moment?
We can own it
Why would you wanna take away from this moment?
Woo-hoo!

You don't have to spend your life with me
You don't have to waste your energy
We can just be rockin', yeah
We can just be rockin', yeah
