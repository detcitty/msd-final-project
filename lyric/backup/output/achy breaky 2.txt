It happened cause I happened to meet up with Billy Cyrus
It happened cause I rang the alarm, and broke the silence
It happened cause I'm sippin' on that good Kentucky whiskey
It happened cause I'd rather be lucky, than good

Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
