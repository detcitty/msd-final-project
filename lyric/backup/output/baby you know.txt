Ever since the first time I saw you
I knew that it had to be me and you
Me for you
Me with you
Forever, forever, baby, forever

If you were my baby
I would give you everything
And if I owned the world, girl
It would be all yours, all yours
We can build a house made for two
It will be me and you
We can raise a family
A girl for you, a boy for me
Oh, baby, baby

Baby, you know
That we should be together forever
Come on, come on, come on
