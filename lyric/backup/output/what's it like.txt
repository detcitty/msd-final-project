Ooh ahh, Ooh ahh, ooh ahh ahh ahh

Everyday I age, I just want my life to change
I done been around, put away my childish things
Like my attitude, it ain't good to be so rude
I wanna be in love, it's my right to
And every year I seem to make some really bad mistakes
And I'm ready now, I don't wanna be this way
I'm finding out, what it's all about. Yeah
I want to be in love

What's it like to be in love? That's all I been thinking of
And I was just wondering, wil love ever know me?
And my heart is open, and I've been hoping
To find what it is everybody keeps on talking 'bout
What's it like to be in love? That's all a nigga thinking of
