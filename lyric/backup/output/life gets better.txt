I used to think that it all stopped happening
by the time you reached twenty one
They said there's nothing like the first love you get boy
They were wrong, oh so wrong,
they hung on and hung on, to their dream, I know

CHORUS
Life gets better yeah
When ever I'm in her arms
Just to know I'm not the average fella
