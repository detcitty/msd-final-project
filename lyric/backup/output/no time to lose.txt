Every day I walk in shadows
I know not what it is
Heading for

And as the evening lies dying
A gentle heart dies near me sighing
It's still the same
You'll never change

You can never understand
We can now be like water
Don't need more to find our way
Just get on where we came
It's a game
What a game

No time to lose
No time to lose

No time to lose
