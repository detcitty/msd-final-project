You've gotta help me, I'm losing my mind,
Keep getting the feel you want to leave this all behind,
Thought we were going strong,
I thought we were holding on
Are we?

No they don't teach you this in school
Now my hearts breaking and I don't know what to do
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holding on
Are we?

You and me got a whole lot of history
