If you've thought it over
And you've made your mind up
You don't want my love any more
If you're gonna leave and
Nothing's gonna stop you
And you're absolutely sure

I want to try to change your mind
Or waste your precious time
Or talk you out of leaving tonight
Just don't ask me to pretend
That I'll fall in love again
The minute you walk out that door

I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss
