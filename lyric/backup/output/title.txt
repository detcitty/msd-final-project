If you want my love
You gotta do what he does
If you want these sweet like sugar Gucci lips
You gotta give it up
I know you think I'm cool
But I ain't one of the boys
No don't be scared that I'm gonna tie you down
I need a little more

Baby, don't call me your friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
If you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye
Give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title
