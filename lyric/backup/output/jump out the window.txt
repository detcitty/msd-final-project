I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
I think I'm ready to jump out the window

Know ya momma didn't raise you to take no disrespect
(I feel) I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check
(You) You cried on my phone the whole night
That time you crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh I was there) I went to straighten his ass out
And told me never mind yeah
The question isn't do he love ya the question is
Do ya love yourself?
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to though and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you were princess
Way back then we the best thing that never happened but

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
