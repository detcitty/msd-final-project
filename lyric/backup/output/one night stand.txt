You say you’re havin’ my baby
But I don’t know if it’s mine
(I don’t know, I don’t know)
It all started from a one night stand
It wasn’t part of the plan

But now I see you got an attitude
And you’re so confused
You didn’t tell me ‘bout your man at home
(Oh, yeah)
So what you gonna do
(Tell me now)

Chillin’ in the club on a Saturday night
Saw you across the bar, you were lookin’ so fly
I can’t believe that you were also looking my way
(Yes, you were, yes, you were)
So I step to you with my game down tight
(Yes, I did)

Before we knew it was on for tonight
So now tell me what’s goin’ on wit’ you, lady, oh, yeah
So tell me what’s goin’ on
(Tell me)
Please don’t make me wait

I know you’re livin’ wit’ your man
(Livin’ wit’ your man)
Sleepin’ wit’ you man
(Sleepin’ wit’ your man)
