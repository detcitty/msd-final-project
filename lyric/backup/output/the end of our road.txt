Oh, it's over, it's all over
Said it's over, it's all over, baby
I gotta get away from you as fast as I can
You're too much for me, woman
More than my heart can stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You've been reckless with my heart
If I stayed around
You'd surely tear it all apart

The road has got to end somewhere
