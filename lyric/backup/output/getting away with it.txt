I've been walking in the rain
Just to get wet on purpose
I've been forcing myself not to forget
Just to feel worse

I've been getting away with it all my life (getting away)
However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
However I look it's clear to see
I love you more than you love me

I hate that mirror
