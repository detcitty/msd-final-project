They used to call me lightening
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
in the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
for never staying very long
just like a wild and restless drifter
like a cowboy in a song

I met a darkhaired beauty
where they lay the whiskey down
in southern Arizona
in a little border town
she had to dance for money
in that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
played that girl a tune, yea

Never see it comin'
just hits you by surprise
it's that cold place in your soul
and the fire in her eyes
makes you come together
like wild horses when they run
now the cards are on the table and
