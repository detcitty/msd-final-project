Mr.305, I want everybody
To get down 'cause we about to shut down

Oh, can't tell me nothing now
Baby, I know how to fly
Oh, can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky

Can't nothing hold me down
Can't nothing hold me down
Can't nothing hold me down

Now watch me, now watch me
Now watch me shut this thang down

Suve, suve, hasta la nube
Balante ante, no mire patra

I hit the jackpot
Chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-ching
Real chicos do real things
On the road to the riches, get diamond rings
