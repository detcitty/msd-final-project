I see you comb your hair and gimme that grin
It's making me spin now, spinnin' within
Before I melt like snow
I say hello, how do you do?

I love the way you undress now, baby begin
Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a mess
I love your blue eyed voice, like tiny Tim shines thru
How do you do?

(How do you do?)

Well, here we are crackin' jokes in the corner of our mouths
