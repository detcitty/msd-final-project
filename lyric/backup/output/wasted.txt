Standing at the back door she tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hard wood it fell like broken glass
She said, "Sometimes love slips away
And you just can't get it back, let's face it"

For one split second, she almost turned around
But that would be like pouring rain drops back into a cloud
So she took another step and said
"I see the way out and I'm gonna' take it"

I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
