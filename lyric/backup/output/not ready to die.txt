Gone cast away in time
Evil yours, now evil mine
So I robbed you blind
The voices in my head

Suggest a less than peaceful side
The endless possibilities
Controlling 9-3-5

You can't break me!
Crushed the fears of yesterday
You can't change me!
Barriers our trust will fade

I've stood in the dark
Been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead
I'm trying to survive
