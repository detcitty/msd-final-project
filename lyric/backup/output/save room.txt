Say that you'll stay a little
Don't say bye bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
just a little bit of love Is worth a moment of your time

knocking on your door just a little
so cold outside tonight
let's get a fire burning

oh I know, I keep it burning right

If you stay, won't you stay - stay
save room for my love
save room for a moment to be with me
save room for my love save a little
save a little for me
