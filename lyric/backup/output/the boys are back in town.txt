Guess who just got back today
Them wild-eyed boys that have been away
Haven't changed that much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy

They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told 'em you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy

The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
I said the boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)

The boys are back in town
(The boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town
