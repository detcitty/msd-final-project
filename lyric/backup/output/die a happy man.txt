Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain.

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
