Your daddy's tellin' you I just ain't no good
And everything I try to do is just misunderstood
But I don't care if your daddy says it's wrong
I just can't stand to be away from you too long

I just can't wait
I just can't wait
I just can't wait
I just can't wait

The clock up on my wall, it must be runnin' slow
