When you have tried to give your all
You try to stand and then you fall
There is no crutch for love that's lame
When you find out, it's all a game

(Then you came along)
Behind all the pretty trimmings
(Don't wanna do wrong)
But with you there ain't no limit

So love or leave
Get yourself together, baby
(Love or leave)
You may never get another chance

(Love me or leave me)
Oh babe
(Love me or leave me)
Love me or leave me, baby
(Love me or leave me)
That's what it's all about
(Love me or leave me)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Love has it's ways of breaking through
You must decide if I'm for you
Then when the way began to die
Keep walking fast, don't break your stride

When darkness has come
We're laying in a daydream
(Said it's no fun)
And you give your partner everything

(Love or leave)
Get it, get it together, girl
(Love or leave)
You may never get another chance

(Love me or leave me)
I gotta find out
(Love me or leave me)
