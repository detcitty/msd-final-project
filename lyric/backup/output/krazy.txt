You're making me crazy
Crazy, crazy for you, crazy
Crazy, crazy for you, crazy

Boy, you're making me
Boy, you're making me
Boy, you're making me crazy

I remember when I saw your face
For the first time, babe
And when you stared at me
You turn me on

And now you got me going crazy
(You're making me crazy)
You got me
(You're making me crazy for you)

Oh, you got me crazy for you
(You're making me crazy)
You got me going out of my mind
(You're making me crazy for you)
