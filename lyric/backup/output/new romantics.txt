We're all bored
We're also tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better
We're so young that we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a classroom

'Cause baby I could build a castle

Out of all the brick they threw at me
And every day it's like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the New Romantics
Come on, come on along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
