There ain't nothing like the first love baby
Remember them high school days
Friday nights, Homecoming dances
Giving my old letterman jacket away
To old what's her name

Now it's you and me
Talking on the phone till 4am
About anything and everything
Making me feel young again
Like ain't a damn thing changed
Ain't a damn thing changed

Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
Climb out your window
Get in girl
