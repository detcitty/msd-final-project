I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal
On a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that
Ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth
You gotta go straight to the source

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay â€˜til they're all long gone
