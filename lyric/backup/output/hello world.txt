Traffic crawls, cell phone calls, talk video screams at me
Through my tinted window I see a little girl, rust red minivan
She's got chocolate on her face, got little hands
And she waves at me, yeah, she smiles at me

Well, hello world, how you been?
Good to see you, my old friend
Sometimes I feel cold as steel
