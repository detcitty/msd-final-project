Ha Ha Ha Ha Yeah
Jam on it
(Yeah, yeah, we know, we know)
Huh
(Yeah, Cozmo, you gonna rock it, right)
(You gonna do it down, right)
Ha-ha-ha-ha, yeah
(Hey, Cozmo, what's the name of this again, I forgot)

Jam on it
(Oh)

(We get to say wikki-wikki-wikki again)

Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki

(Shut up)
Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki

Three words to the whack, step yourself back
Just gettin' down, and you then you're givin' no slack
Like a Burger King with a sack of Big Macs
We're throwin' down with the radical sacks
On time, in your mind you see
You gotta boogie to your best ability
You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down
And when you're funkin' up, be sure to pass it around
Come on, let's go to work
We got what'll make your body jerk
Make you throw your hands up in the air
