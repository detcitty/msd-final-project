I'm sprung
Now that she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you

I'm sprung
(I'm sprung)
Now that she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you

You do
You do
You do
You do

You do
You do
You do

I'm sprung
Now that she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you

I'm sprung
(I'm sprung)
Now that she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm tellin' you

You do
You do
You do
You do

You do do do, do do
