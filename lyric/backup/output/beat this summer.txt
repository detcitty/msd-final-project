Like the first wheel goes around and around 
Well the trouble with up is there's always a down 
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk 
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks 

But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast 
And the sand the beach is like an hourglass 
I can just feel it all slipping away 
And babe I can already say that 

As long I live, whatever I do
