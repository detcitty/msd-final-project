Yellow City, yeah
Benzino, yeah
Yellow Man, yeah
Young Hef, yeah
 (That's what they call me)
Yellow City, yeah
(That's where I'm from)
Benzino, yeah
 (My nigga)
Young Hef, yeah, c'mon rock

Checkin' in the closet for my blue Velour suit
Piping all around it wit the matchin' Timb boots
Hop up in the wagon wit the 20 inch shoes on, ohh

Ridin' down the street wit a twenty G stack
Shorty paging me sayin', "Zino where you at?"
Look up in the mirror 5-0 up on my back it's, uh ohh

Pull up in the spot smokin' in the parkin' lot
Everybody havin' fun, don't stop
Pray to God that I don't have to let the pop it's

Maybe all the ladies wanna chill wit Benz and Hef
Pushin' up the bottle 'til there's no more Henny left
Step it up to Louie now let's see what happens next yo

We gon' throw the party, rock the party
Then drink Bacardi, freak somebody
Then leave the party to the after party y'all, ohh
