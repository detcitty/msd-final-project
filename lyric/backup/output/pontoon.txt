Back this hitch up into the water
Untie all the cables and rope
Step onto the astro turf
Get yourself a koozie
Let's go

Who said anything about skiin'?
Floatin' is all I wanna do
You can climb the ladder
Just don't rock the boat while I barbecue

On the pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' off the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
