So many times I've been let down
To the point where love made no sound
Then you came and love moved back in
Now it's my turn to give back again
I want you to know that
I'm here for you
When you need someone too
Cause you were always there for me
So let me return the favor, please
So many people wasted my time
Too bad I couldn't
See behind their smiles
Are you an angel in disguise
Cause you made me realize
You will always be my best friend
Cause you gave me the
Strength to go on again
I want you to know that
I'm here for you
