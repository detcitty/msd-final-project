What's got you so jumpy?
Why can't you sit still, yeah?
Like gasoline you want to pump me
And leave me when you get your fill, yeah
Every time I touch you honey you get hot
I want to make love you never stop
Come up for air you push me to the floor
What's been going on in that head of yours

Unskinny bop
Just blows me away
Unskinny bop, bop
All night and day
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop
She just loves to play
Unskinny bop nothin' more to say
