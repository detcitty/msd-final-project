Gimme, gimme, gimme woah, woah
Gimme, gimme, gimme

Sweet as honey, your lips I taste
You touch my body and you've been praised
So deep is my love for you
Anticipating every single move

You are the one that I'm dreaming of
Won't you stay with me tonight, baby
You're all I want, all I'm thinking of
Move your body close to mine

Gimme, gimme, gimme some love woah, woah
I've been waiting forever
Gimme, gimme, gimme some love woah, woah
