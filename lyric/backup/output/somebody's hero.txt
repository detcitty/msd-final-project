She's never pulled anybody from a burning building
She's never rocked Central Park to a half a million fans screaming out her name
She's never hit a shot to win the game
She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon ride around the world
No she's just your everyday average girl (but)

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her baby with a skinned-up knee
A little kiss is all she needs
The keeper of the Cheerios
The voice that brings Snow White to life
