Wakin' up to find another day
The moon got lost again last night
But now the sun has finally had its say
I guess I feel alright

But it hurts when I think
When I let it sink in
It's all over me
I'm lying here, in the dark
I'm watching you sleep

it hurts a lot
And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me
I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
