This is a story about control, my control
Control of what I say, control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do

Are we ready? I am
'Cause it's all about control
And I've got lots of it

When I was seventeen
I did what people told me
Did what my father said
And let my mother mold me
But that was a long ago, I'm in

Control
(Never gonna stop)
Control
(To get what I want)

Control
(I like to have a lot)
Control
(Now I'm all grown up)

First time I fell in love
I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive
I thought it would be easy
Now I know I've got to take

Control
