You keep me waiting
I don't mind waiting
I don't wait for everyone
This is a one-time situation

You say you need me
I believe you need me
But you're fooling no one
This is a one-time situation

What does it matter
Who's been taken in
Ah, what does it matter
When you've got two hearts
Aching to begin

Here's the opportunity
Come and take it to the nth degree
