Shake that thing Miss Kana Kana
Shake that thing Miss Annabella
Shake that thing yan Donna Donna

Woman Get busy
Just shake that booty non-stop
When the beat drops
Just keep swinging it
Get jiggy
Get crunked up
Percolate anything you want to call it
Oscillate you hip and don't take pity
Me want fi see you get live among
the riddim when me ride
And me lyrics a provide electricity
Gal nobody can tell you nuttin'
Can you done know your destiny

Yo sexy ladies want par with us
In a the car with us
Them nah war with us
In a the club them want flex with us
To get next to us
Them cah vex with us

From the day me born jah ignite me flame
gal a call me name
and jah its me fame
Its all good girl turn me on
Til a early mornin'

Let's get it on

Let's get it on til a early morning
Girl it's all doog just turn me on

Woman don't sweat it
Don't get agitate just gwaan rotate
Can anything you want you know
You must get it
From you name a mentuin
Don't ease the tension just run the program
gals wan pet it
