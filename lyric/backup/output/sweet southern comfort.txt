Misty sunrise in my hometown
Rows of cotton bout knee high
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road
Still got clothes out on the line

Erwin Nichols there with Judge Lee
Playin checkers at the gin
When I dream about the southland
This is where it all begins

From Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the Jasmine and Magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
