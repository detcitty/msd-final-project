It's easy to feel like
Your all alone
To feel like nobody knows
The great that you are
The good that's inside you
Is trying so hard to break through
Maybe it's your time to lift off and fly
You wont know if you never try
I will be there with you all of the way
You'll be fine

Don't let anyone tell you that you're not strong enough
Don't give up there's nothing wrong with just beign yourelf
That's more than enough
So come on and raise your voice
Speakin bout it make some noise
