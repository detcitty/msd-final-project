Late night catch me creepin'
With yo' damn ol' lady
Servin' swervin' on the highway
And I'm doing bout 80
I can see them haters talkin'
But it do not phase me
I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
That's that shit that made me
I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
(aye aye aye)

I done got it out the mud
That's that shit that made me
I done ate up out that mud
And it taste like gravy
All I try to do is flip the 4 into a baby
All I wanna do is flip the 4 to feed my babies
See I know these niggas watchin'
And these niggas hate me
