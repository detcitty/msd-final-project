On that very first day, the Lord sat down
And saw fit to say “let there be light!”
So He could tell the day time from the night.
And then He spoke again and filled the wind
With calm and rolling in, smelled the rain
And saw very fine.

And then the mountains rose up,
Across the great planes
And all the angels up in Heaven started singing
“all it’s missing is a pretty thing”

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
