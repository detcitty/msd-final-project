Guess there are times
When we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these
When we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know
Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room
