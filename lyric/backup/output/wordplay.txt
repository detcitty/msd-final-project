I've been all around the world
I've been a new sensation
But it doesn't really matter
In this ge-generation
The sophomore slump is an uphill battle
And someone said it ain't my scene

'Cause they need a new song
Like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math

For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Got to find another way to live the life of leisure
So I drop my top, mix and I mingle
Is everybody ready for the single and it goes

Ah, la, la, la, la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
Ah, la, la, la, la
It's all about the wordplay
Ah, la, la, la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
