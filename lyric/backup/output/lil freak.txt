Ay, girl, yeah, you the business
So what the business?
Don't be shy, I'm just talking to you, girl
Aye, ma, yo, where your man at?
I know you got that
'Cause you too fine to be single out here, girl
He at home but he done fucked up
I swooped his girl up
And what I'm about do to you, he'll feel I did him wrong
'Cause I'm about to have a menage with his lady
And some freaks at the bar who like fucking with a star
I told her...

If you're coming with me, really coming with me
You go get some girls and bring them to me
If you're coming with me, really coming with me
