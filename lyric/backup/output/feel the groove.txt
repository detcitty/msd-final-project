My head is numb, without thought it was
My heart is numb but you thought it did
When I look in the mirror, it just takes place
Cause when I see, I see your face

Now you don't know what's going on
Cause you just think that I've been wrong
But I tell you, babe, what's going on
It is your feeling that's too strong

Drop that ghetto blaster

To the Bat Cave, let's go

Let you know
That it's time for you to go
Cause you're gonna break my heart
