Freedom come, Freedom go
Tell me yes and then she tells me no
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along
Freedom want, Freedom stay
Freedom love and then she flies away
Freedom never stay long
Freedom moving along

Daddy is a doctor, Mother is a debutante
Pillars of societyLiving in a mansion somewhere in the country
And another in Chelsea
Freedom is a rich girl, daddy's little sweet girl
