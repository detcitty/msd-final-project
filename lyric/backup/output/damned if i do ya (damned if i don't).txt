I fought it for a long time now
While drowning in a river of denial
I washed up, fixed up, picked up all my broken things
'Cause you left me, police tape, chalk line
Tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime
Suburban living with a feeling that I'm giving up
Everything for you

Oh, oh, oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh, oh, over me
I think that I should go (GO!)
Something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't
