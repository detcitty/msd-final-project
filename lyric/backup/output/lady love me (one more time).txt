Ooh... ooh... ooh...
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...

If you're askin' me to say
Livin' life without you, girl, is alright
If you really want to know
I'd have to say it's dangerous to my mind

So before you turn and walk away
Just let me love you one more time
Feel your heartbeat close to mine
Let me love you all the time
Lady, love me

Yes, I'm askin' you to stay
