I got a secret for you
Can't believe myself
But ever since you've been gone
I think of no one else
I've even tried to forget
But nothing can make me
I know that it's so hard to be true
Under the summer skies
I'll write your name in my cook
At a thousand times
And every day you're away
It's drivin' me crazy

So I'll write you every night
And I'll sign my name? Love always?
And even if the sun falls down
I will always be around
Forever and always
