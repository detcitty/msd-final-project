Good times come to me now
Good times come to me now

I ain't lying 'cause there ain't no time
No city it's a pity 'cause I dress divine
City smokes, people choke
Big meanie he's a genie and we ain't got a hope
No chance, no chance

Well, I feel fine, no it ain't no crime
I was dreamin' of a demon and I ate a dime
The dime floats, the colonel boasts
