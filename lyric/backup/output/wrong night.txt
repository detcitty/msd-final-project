I set my mind to it
Said "I wasn't gonna do it"
No how, no sir, no way
I wouldn't give my heart up
Gonna keep my guard up
And save it for another day

Then you walked in
With that crazy grin
And everything I swore before
Got lost in your eyes
And flew right out the door

Suddenly I heard the love songs
