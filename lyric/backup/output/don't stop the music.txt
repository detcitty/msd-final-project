Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music
Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music

Don't you know you've got me mesmerized
With the beat I always fantasize
Don't stop the music 'cause it tends to soothe
I can tell you want to groove

Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music (The beat keep goin' 'round and 'round)
Don't you stop it, don't you stop (Turns me upside down)
Don't stop the music

I just wanna rock (All, all night long)
