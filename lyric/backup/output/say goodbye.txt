Got a lot on my mind, I want to tell you
I don't know where to start
You're gettin' way outta line, I want to tell you
You're actin' too damn smart

This little game you're playin'
Has lost its fun, somehow
You had me goin' but I figured it out
An' I'm not playin', I'm not playin' now, baby

(Say goodbye)
I'll be leavin' in the mornin'
There's nothin' you can do to make me stay, baby

(Say goodbye)
I'll be leavin' in the mornin'
Say goodbye, it's the only thing to say
Then I'll be on my way
