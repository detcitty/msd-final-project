Whoa no, whoa yeah
(Woo, oh)
Whoa no, whoa no, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
There's a gentle autumn breeze that blows
Whenever we be lyin', lyin' in my bed
The moon appears and disappears, you look at me
My clothes I quickly, I quickly shed
The curtains dance a minuet
Autumn plays the music, baby
Come on, hold my hand
Leaves are fallin' velvet splash
Only you and I can under, only you can understand
The sunlight draws a picture through the silky lace
That hangs above your, hangs above your door
A picture that is waving that it seems
To be with every thrust you make me beg for more
Oh, a robin sings a masterpiece
That lives and dies unheard
For screams of passion
