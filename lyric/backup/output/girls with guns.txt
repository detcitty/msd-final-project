I'll tell you now
And I won't tell you twice
Where, when, and how
I got some bad advice

I never thought I could handle
A girl with guns
And let me tell ya
You can bet that I'm not the only one (oh no...)

Stand tall, don't think small
Don't get your back against the wall
Shoot straight, I can't wait
Aim for the heart and fire away (No! )

I've come around
