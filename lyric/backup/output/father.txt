I swear to tell the truth and nothin' but the truth, so help me, God
I just felt like tellin' the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that
If your plane crashed in the water, and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped, my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple, pops caught a attitude
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms 'cause she's talkin' on the phone, come on
(All I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(All I ever needed)
All I ever needed
(Was a father)
Was a father
(That's all)
That's all
(All I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(All I ever needed)
All I ever needed was a father
(Was a father)
Moms got tired of the beatings said, "Yo, we got to go"
Packed up her bags we bounced out the door
She said, "I ain't takin' these whippin's no more
I wanna live to see my little Todd grow"
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Lookin' down at me, standin' on the staircase
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feelin' me?
(All I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(All I ever needed)
All I ever needed
(Was a father)
Was a father
