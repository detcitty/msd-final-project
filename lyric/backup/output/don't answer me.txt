If you believe in
The power of magic
I can change your mind
And if you need to
Believe in someone
Turn and look behind

When we were living
In a dream world
Clouds got in the way
We gave it up in
A moment of madness
And threw it all away

Don't answer me
Don't break the silence
Don't let me win
Don't answer me
Stay on your island
Don't let me in

Run away and
