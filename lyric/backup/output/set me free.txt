There ain't no reason why you let me wait
Just give me up and I will go, let's set it straight
Got a right to who I am
And if I don't fit your plan then set me free

But you refuse to set me free
And you deny me of my needs
You have me under lock and key
Just set me free, just set me free

You never cared for what I had to say
It's just because you got to have it all your way
Well, I ain't no superman
If that's what you demand then set me free

Couldn't you please just set me free
