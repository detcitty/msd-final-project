You ready?
Whoo!
Here we go!

Life is just a party so come as you are
Dress it up or dress it down, never forget your guitar
Just be courageous, cause style's contagious
Everyone can rock out like a superstar

Let's get crazy
Get up and dance
Take a swing, do your thing
If we're taking a chance

Let's get crazy
Yeah just kick up your heels
Don't miss out, time to shout
Always keeping it real
Let's get crazy
Crazy
