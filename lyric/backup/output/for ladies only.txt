What you say to drive that girl away
When she's the one and only?
Who's the one that you been leanin' on
Ev'ry time that you were down and lonely?
How many times did you say to yourself that woman is the devil's tool?
Somehow you knew that you blew it again and didn't wanna look like a ravin fool
But when you need affection
You go to her with a smilin' face
But now she's got a strange reaction

For ladies only
