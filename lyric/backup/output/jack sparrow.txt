Guys, Michael Bolton is here
Oh Great, send him in.
Hey guys.
Hey, hi, thanks for coming
Sorry I'm late, I got caught up watching the Pirates of the Carribean marathon.
Have you seen those things?
Oh yeah, yeah, those are, those are great.
Well, I checked out the track and I loved it.
And I wrote you this big sexy hook I think you're really gonna dig.
Oh wow that's great, awesome. Should we just lay it down?
Boys, lets get to it.
Here we go.

Ungh, Lonely Island, Michael Bolton
Yeah!
The night starts now
Together on the track, the boys are back
The night starts now
Night starts now baby roll with us
Chickens snapping at the neck when we rollin' up.
Rollin' up!
Blow through the doors ain't no holdin' up
Yeah!
Black card at the bar like I gives a fuck.
Come on
Ladies shifty eyed when we walk into the set
Fuck the fellas looking jealous play the back and get wet
Yeah! Yeah!
Three pound in my waist, shank in my sock
