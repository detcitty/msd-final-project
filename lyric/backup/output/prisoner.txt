You bring good to my lonely life, honestly
It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When, I say that I would be nothing without your love
I feel the rush and it's amazing
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place, yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way
Cause I know, all I know, all I know
