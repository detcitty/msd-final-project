My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away
From me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far away

Carried your books from school
Playing make-believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be

Walking home every day over
Barnegat Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you
