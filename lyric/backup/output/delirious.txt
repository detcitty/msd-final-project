I get delirious whenever you're near
lose all self-control, baby just can't steer
wheels get locked in place
stupid look on my face
It comes 2 makin' a pass, pretty mama
i just can't win a race
'cuz i get delirious (delirious)
delirious (delirious)
delirious (delirious)
I get delirious when u hold my hand (delirious)
