Hopes dashed to the floor
Like shattered teenage dreams
Boys livin' next door
Are never what they seem

A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are starin' and followin' me
This is my only escape from it all
Watchin' a film or a face on the wall

Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
