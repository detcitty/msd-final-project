Five long years
We have been together
Your love and understanding
Has brought us through stormy weather

I must admit girl
I haven't always been good
But you stuck by me
Just like you said you would

Hey, I know that enough is enough
But you shouldn't be talking 'bout givin' it up
Turn it loose, it might be right it seems
The wrong decision will spoil all our dreams

If you don't want to spoil our secret dreams
Don't change horses in the middle of a stream

Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o yeah
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o silver
