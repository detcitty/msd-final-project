Ooh baby, give it to me now, girl

Can't nobody give it out
For me and you, yeah, girl
I wanna pull down the shades and the lights
And do what I wanna do to hear it girl

You can tell me now baby
I can't keep trying to play nice together
Oh girl before the night is over
I bet, I bet I can make you sweat

You say no, I say yes
Girl I bet, I can make you sweat
