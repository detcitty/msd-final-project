No, sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame
Not anymore
It's your turn, so take a seat
We're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why?

All the possibilities
Well, I was wrong
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
