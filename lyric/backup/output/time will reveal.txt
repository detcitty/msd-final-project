What can I do
To make you feel secure
Remove all your doubts
So that you'll know for sure

That you're the apple of my eye, girl
Fulfillment of my dream
Time will show the value
Of just what you mean to me

More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings
Or anything that I could give you

It wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love
