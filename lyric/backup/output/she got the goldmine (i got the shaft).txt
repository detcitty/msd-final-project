Well, I guess it was back in '63
When eatin' my cookin' got the better of me,
So I asked this little girl I was goin' with to be my wife.
Well, she said she would, so I said “I do”.
But I'da said I wouldn't if I'da just knew
How sayin' “I do” was gonna screw up all of my life!

Well, the first few years weren't all that bad â "
I'll never forget the good times we had
Cause I'm reminded every month when I send her the child support.
Well, it wasn't too long till the lust all died,
And I'll admit I wasn't too surprised
The day I come home and found my suitcase sittin' out on the porch.

Well, I tried to get in â " she changed the locks!
Then I found this note taped on the mailbox
That said, “Goodbye, turkey! My attorney will be in touch!” Mm-hmm…
So I decided right then and there
