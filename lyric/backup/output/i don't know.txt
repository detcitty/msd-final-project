You don't know, what you've done to me, in the name of love
Do I dare, make a mess of things, have I had enough?

The words are saying I love you, but I've seen the truth turned to lies
I'm not so sure I want you, Do you wonder why?
I don't know who to love anymore
When my heart broke and closed up the door
And the love that's the key now is so far from me
If I found it I wouldn't know what it's for
I'm not sure of my left from my right
