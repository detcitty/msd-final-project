I was in love with you
And gave my heart to you
I did my best
To keep you satisfied

You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back
Your love to me at all

I gave the sun to you
You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine

I gave my world to you
But you said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done
To make you be so rough?

'Til you do me right
I don't even wanna talk to you
I don't even wanna hear
You speak my name

And 'til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
