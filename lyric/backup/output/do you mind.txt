Another one
We The Best Music!

Yo, he ain't messing with no average chick, pop, pop
He got Nicki, he know that he hit the jackpot
Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks
But I hit 'em with them 'Bron/Iguodala blocks
Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes
Hitting them home runs, I'll be like "go Mets!"
I want a dude that'll still kiss me when he mad
Type to cop me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags

Girl we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby you should be up in my bed
Do you mind, do you mind? (DJ Khaled)
Baby you, do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?

I'm just tryna get to know ya
Get a little closer, maybe post up
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Girl we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby you should be up in my bed
Do you mind, do you mind?
Baby you, do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?

You know, you know, you know, you know
He ain't got forever and ever
You know, you know, you know, you know
Let me be the one, baby you deserve better
You know, you know, you know, you know
We ain't got forever and ever
You know, you know, you know, you know
Let me be the one, baby do you mind? Do you mind?
