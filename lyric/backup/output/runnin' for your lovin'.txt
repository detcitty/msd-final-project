Since we've part, our lives become a new
Searching life's long fantasies are through
Giving all we've got to give wouldn't do
You try so hard, I'll get into the mood
Now it's time to kiss and say farewell
Before I go there's something I should tell
I'll be
Runnin' for your lovin'
When you need someone
Runnin' for your lovin'
[Unverified] I got some
Runnin' for your lovin'
Let me kiss ya' 'cause I miss ya'
Runnin' for your lovin'
I will do
Runnin' for your lovin'
If you need some affection
Runnin' for your lovin'
Point me in the right direction
Runnin' for your lovin'
Say you'll let me love you
Runnin' for your lovin'
I will do
