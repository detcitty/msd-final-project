You've been singing that same old song
Far too long, far too long
Say you'll buy me a shiny ring
But your words don't mean a thing

No more calling me baby, no more loving like crazy

'Til you take me down
(Take me down)
You better take me down
(Take me down)
Take me down to the little white church

Take me down
(Take me down)
Take me down
(Take me down)
Take me down to the little white church
Take me down

You can't ride this gravy train
Anymore anyways
There's a price for keeping me
