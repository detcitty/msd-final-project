Tell you 'bout a dream
That I have every night
Tell you 'bout a dream
That I have every night

It ain't Kodachrome and
It isn't black and white
Take me for a fool
If you feel that's right
Well, I'm never on my own
But there's nobody in sight

I don't know why
I'm scared of the lightning
Trying to reach me
I can't turn to the
Left or the right

I'm too scared to run
And I'm too weak to fight
