Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ah yeah, yeah

Yesterday changed my mind
Now I see you as one of a kind
How I really need you
(How I really need you)
Hope you feel the same way too
(Hope you feel the same way)

Cause if you look (If you look you will find)
It's me (It's me you need in your life)
It's really not about me
It's really all about you
