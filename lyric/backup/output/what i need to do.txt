I keep tellin' myself, this is the right thing to do
I was wastin' her time, waitin' on dreams, that just weren't comin' true
And this old highway, seems to understand
Leadin' me on to somewhere, no one knows my name
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up
I'm doin' all I can, to get my mind off us
