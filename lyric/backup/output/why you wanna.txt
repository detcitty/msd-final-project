Hey T.I.P pimpin'
Hey shorty why you gotta act like that? I'm sayin'...
I'm just tryin' to be nice to you.

Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that... hey-hey.

Can't help but notice how you glowin' I can see in yo face
Now I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing that you need yo' space
Selling niggas is one thing you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between yo' knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you makin, get yo' knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
