I've been looking under rocks and breaking locks
Just tryna find ya
I've been like a maniac insomniac
5 steps behind you
Tell them other girls, they can hit the exit
Check please...
Cause I finally found the girl of... my dreams
Much more than a Grammy award
That's how much you mean to me

You could be my it girl
Baby you're the shit girl
Lovin' you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit girl
This is it girl
Give me 25 to life
I just wanna rock all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight
You could be my it girl

You're my biggest hit girl

Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud
