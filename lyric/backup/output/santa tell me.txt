Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
Let it snow, is blasting now
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's true love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
