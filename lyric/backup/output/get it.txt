Miss Lady Girl
Is putting her love on the shelf
Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else

She's taken her heart
And put it away under lock and key
But its high time
Miss Lady Girl sets her heart free and gives her love to me

Some think that diamond rings; fancy cars
Will make a big impression
But I know that all she needs is my tender
Love and affection
Cause she still says
