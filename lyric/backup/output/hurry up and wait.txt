I don't wanna be no clock watcher
Standin' in line
I don't wanna be someone in love
Wastin' my time

Can I get right to the point, baby
You know I care
Tell me what you want, yeah, baby
And I'm right here

Now tell me what it is I'm supposed to do
And someday I'll get to you
But in the meantime
I know what I gotta do

Hurry up and wait, yeah, baby
On your love
Hurry up and wait, yeah, baby
On your love
