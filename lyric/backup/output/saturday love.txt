(feat. Alexander O'Neal)

[INTRO: Cherrelle talking]
It's been a long time
I didn't think I was
Going to see you again
See you haven't changed
It's good to see you anyway

[CHORUS:]
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love

[VERSE: Cherrelle]
When I think about you
My feelings can't explain
Why after all this time
My heart still feels pain
When I look at you
Memories of love
Like no one before
You stay on my mind

(Special feelings, special time)
Always so special
(I was yours and you were mine)
