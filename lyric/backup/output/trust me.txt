Who's been telling you these things
Don't you know it's not true
You believe those crazy guys
They deceive you with their lies
They'll make you believe what they want you to

Ooh, darling, look at me
I wouldn't be here if I did not care
I wouldn't hurt you if my life depended on it
Love don't work unless you learn to share it
