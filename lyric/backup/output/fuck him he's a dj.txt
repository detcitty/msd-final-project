Drop drop this track
He's a stereotype
He's got the baseball cap
And he's building the hype
As he's feeding me this hot track
Oh, he's feeding me this hot track
Oh oh
You see we share the same guy
With that same load
I never wanna stop
I don't wanna give him up
Nah, I don't wanna give him up
Nah nah
I I I I am losing time
