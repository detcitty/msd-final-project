You say you're hurting oh 'cause
They say I'm flirting oh no
You just can't take it anymore
Your friends say I'm no good for you
But in my heart I'm so true
A partner for life we can be sure

You've asked me for some time to clear you mind
I stayed away it hurt so much
Without your touch
Now I'm back and you say

Just a little bit longer baby
'Cause my love keeps growing stronger
A little more time to say but in my head a love song plays
For you and me

We played in the rain together
That feeling lives on forever
