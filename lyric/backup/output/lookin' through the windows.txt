(Lookin' through the window)
(Lookin' through the window)
(Look, look, look through the window)
(Lookin' through the window)

Lookin' through the windows
The window to your heart, oh baby, yeah
I can see it's cloudy
The rain's about to start

Lookin' through the windows
(Lookin' through the window)
It seems I caused your fears, yeah, yeah, yeah
