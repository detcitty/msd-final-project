Sparks fly
It's like electricity
I might die
When I forget how to breathe
You get closer and there's nowhere in this world I'd rather be

Time stops like everything around me
It's frozen and nothing matters but these
Few moments when you open
My mind to things I've never seen

'Cause when I'm kissing you my senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle piece I've been trying to find
Falls right into place, you're all that it takes
