When I'm lost in the rain
In your eyes I know I'll find
The light to light my way
When I'm scared, losing ground
When my world is going crazy
You can turn it all around, yes

And when I'm down you're there, pushing me to the top
You're always there giving me all you've got

For a shield, from the storm
For a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm
I turn to you
