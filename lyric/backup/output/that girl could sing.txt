That girl could sing
jackson browne
She was a friend to me when i needed one
wasn't for her i don't know what i'd done
she gave me back something that was missing in me
she could of turned out to be almost anyone
almost anyone--
with the possible exception
of who i wanted her to be
running into the midnight
