Don't touch my hair
When it's the feelings I wear
Don't touch my soul
When it's the rhythm I know
Don't touch my crown
They say the vision I've found
Don't touch what's there
When it's the feelings I wear

They don't understand
What it means to me
Where we chose to go
Where we've been to know
They don't understand
What it means to me
Where we chose to go
Where we've been to know

You know this hair is my shit, rode the ride, I gave it time
But this hair is mine
You know this hair is my shit, rode the ride, I gave it time
But this hair is mine
