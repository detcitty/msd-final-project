That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down
That Georgia sun was blood red and goin' down

Daddy said, "Now come girl
We're headed down the road to Augusta"
And frankly through his clenched teeth
He called Mama's name and then he cussed her

He said, "Girl, you're young
But some dude has come along and stole your mother"
