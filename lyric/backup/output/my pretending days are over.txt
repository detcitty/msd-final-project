My pretending days are over
Gonna leave the acting
To the stars in Hollywood

My pretending days are over
Gonna leave acting
To the stars in Hollywood
Oh, yeah, yeah

I should receive the Academy Award
For every girl I fooled
In this old town

I played my tricks on them
Told them they looked so sweet
When I knew all the time
Not a one did I want to keep

My pretending days are over
I'm gonna leave the acting
