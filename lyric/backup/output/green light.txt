Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now (Let's go!)
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
I see you move, I'm checking your smile
Workin your back like, it's going out of style
Shake just a little bit faster
Shake just a little now girl
Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
Got an obsession, of us getting down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission soooo
Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now (Let's go!)
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
One, two, three - green light
Well, if it's what it seems like
