I've cussed on a sunday
I've cheated and I've lied
I've fallen down from grace a few too many times
But I find holy redemption
when I put this car in drive
roll the windows down and turn up the dial
Can I get a hallelujah
Can I get an Amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya

When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
