The first heaven is silver
And you are silver, you shine white light
The second heaven's sacred
And you are sacred of pure soul
The third heaven is pearl
And your name is forever written
Oh, don't walk away
No, don't walk away

I'm walking in the presence of love
I'm walking in the seven heavens
I'm alive with the agony, the ecstasy
Strive for the pleasure and the pain
