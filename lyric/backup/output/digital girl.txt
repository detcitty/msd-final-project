Yeah, girl, you so sexy do
As she just lay at your feet

I wanna see what's under there
There now put it in the air
Yeah, load it on my macbook air
It's a new form of macking, don't be old fashioned
Update your passion

Only reason why I be eye chattin'
It's when it's time for some action
I wanna hit it way, way out like John Paxton
But for now I just gotta watch her practice
Send her a picture so she see it

She says, I-I-I can't believe it
Ohh, she all on me, on me
Ohh, I think she want me, want me
I think she showed her homies

Why? 'Cause all the homies on me
Ayo, all the digital gonna have to do for now
But I'ma break it down when I get by your town

I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
