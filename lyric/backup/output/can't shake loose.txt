(Russ Ballard)

I don't wanna stay here but I can't leave,
I'm in the spell of the magic you weave,
Somebody wake me up
I wish I could break it up,
But I can't shake loose, can't shake loose
I can't shake loose, can't shake loose
Any move I'll make in the end I will lose.

I can't shake loose
I try and I try but it ain't no use
I could go like I did before
