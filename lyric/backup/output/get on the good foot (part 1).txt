Can't pass the people, can't pass the, hit me

Ooh, get on down like
Uh, I wanna get on the good foot
Ho, good foot, I got to get on the good foot, ah

Going down to the crib, let all hang out
Where soulful people knows, what it's about, ah
Going down to the crib and let it all hang out, ah

Where soulful people knows, what it's about, ah
Where people do the sign and take your hands, ah
And dancin' to the music James Brown Band

They're dancing on the good foot
I got to get on the good foot
Got to do it on the good foot
