if these walls came crumbling down
and fell so hard to make us lose our faith
from what's left you'd figure it out
and still make lemonade taste like a sunny day

stay beautiful, baby
I hope you stay American, baby
American baby

nobody's laughing now
God's grace lost and the devil is proud
but I've been walking for a thousand miles
one last time I could see you smile
