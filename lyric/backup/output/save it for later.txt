Two dozen other dirty lovers
Must be a sucker for it
Cry, cry but I don't need my mother
Just hold my hand while I come to a decision on it

Sooner or later
Your legs give way, you hit the ground
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down
Sooner or later
You'll hit the deck, you'll get found out
