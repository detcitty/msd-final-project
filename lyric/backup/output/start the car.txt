Yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Well I'm tired of the pressure
So tired of the pace
Just wanna grab you baby
And get out of this place
I got no chance of making it
Working downtown
Just walking slow and talking low
And tired of going down, down, down
Start the car, we gotta move
This ain't no living, this ain't no groove
It's been a long hard road
Come on baby (ooh baby)
