Uhh!

(Ko-ko Joe)

Go ahead home.

(Ko-ko Joe)

Up in Appaloosa county,

There's a place called Ko-ko Ridge.

Sittin' right on the bend,

On the Etowah River

Where the water washed away the bridge.

Cotton Mouth Country.

(Ko-ko Joe)

A river rat's knee high,

(Ko-ko Joe)

Way up around the back border,

Lived a man,

That the river folks talked about.

They said you better stay away from Ko-ko Joe,

'Cause he's cause he's crazy no account.

(Ko-ko Joe)

They called him the Etowah River swamp rat,

The folks despised him.

Ko-ko Joe,
