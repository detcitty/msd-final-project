True Stories (what) Miracles (What) True Blessing (What)

I was riding in my car one day, in the express lane, rolling on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings, then I reached down beside me
Then I looked on the floor felt on the back seat
See I was drinking while I was driving.
Never thinking what I was doin
I turned around and before I knew it here comes this truck now.
The doctor said "I dont think he isn't gonna to make it."
Family said "Make the funeral arrangements."
Unplug the machine he's gone now, then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said unto me "If you promise to stop drinking,..."
I surrendered the pain that day.
Now for ten years I've been straight
(()) You saved me, You saved me, You saved me, you saved me (Thank you Jesus)
Gave me a second chance, you saved me, you saved me (Thank You Jesus)(Repeat 2 more times)
((verse 2))
