Wait a minute baby
Stay with me a while
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me about the fire

Drowning
In the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me call

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

And he was just like
A great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
And undoing
