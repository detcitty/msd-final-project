Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time

Get those problems of your head
Put your mama to bed
But don't stay too far from reality
Or you will live in a dream world

Dreaming of things that there ain't no possiblity
Who we believe me
Let's have a nice grooving time
But don't go too far
From the truth in your mind

'Cause you'll drink and drive
And then you'll fly too high
And so you'll pay the price
For justa feeling nice

Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time
(Melody makers, more melody makers)
Though the world is cruel and blind
Let's have a good time

So many things to foresee
We were not born to live this way
We were born having fun in the jungle of grace
With plenty food to eat and plenty drink to drink
So you know what I mean when I say

Liberate yourself from the state that you're in
And don't get involved in
That everywhere it stink, it stink, it stink
