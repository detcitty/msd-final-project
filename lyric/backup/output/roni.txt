The truth about a Roni
She's a sweet little girl
If you treat her right, real nice, and hold her tight
But only tenderonis can give a special love
A special kind of love that makes you feel good inside
If you believe in love and all that it can do for you
Give it a chance, girl
You'll find romance
And if you find a tenderoni that is right for you
Make it official, give her your love
My heart belongs to my roni
(She's my only love)
She's my only love
(My only heart baby)
My heart belongs to my roni
(She's my only love)
She's my only love
The truth about a roni
She's always on the phone
Talking to her homeboy
Wishing they were home alone
She sends you lovely letters
With the smell of sweet perfume
