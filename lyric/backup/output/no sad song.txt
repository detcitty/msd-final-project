Women fell into his arms
He rolled them up just like cigars
Later on he would discard them
On the hardwood floor

Visions of power danced in his head
Let them right, he'd throw women out of his bed
There's still a spot where one of them bled
On the hardwood floor

Sing me no sad song
Sing me no sad song
