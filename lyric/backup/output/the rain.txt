I saw you (and him) walking in the rain; you were holding hands and I'll never be the same.

Tossing and turning another sleepless night the rain crashes against my window pane
Jumped into my car didn't drive too far, that moment I knew I would never be the same. 'Cause

I saw you (and him) walking in the rain; you were holding hands and I'll never be the same.
I saw you (and him) walking in the rain; you were holding hands and I'll never be the same.

Now here you are begging to me to give our love another try
Girl I love you and I always will but darling right now I've got to say goodbye. 'Cause

I saw you (and him) walking in the rain; you were holding hands and I'll never be the same.
