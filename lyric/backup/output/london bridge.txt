Oh shit!
Oh shit!
Oh shit!
(Are you ready for this?)
Oh shit!

Oh! It's me, Fergie
The pimp, Polow!
Fergie Ferg, what's up baby?
Come on!

When I come to the club step aside
(Oh shit!)
Part the seas, don't be havin' me in the line
(Oh shit!)

V.I.P. ‘cause you know I gotta shine
(Oh shit!)
I'm Fergie Ferg and me love you long time
(Oh shit!)

All my girls get down on the floor
(Oh shit!)
Back to back, drop it down real low
(Oh shit!)

I'm such a lady but I'm dancin' like a ho
(Oh shit!)
‘Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go!
(Oh shit!)

How come every time you come around
