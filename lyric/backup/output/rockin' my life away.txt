I lived 14, 95 and 19, 48
I throwed a rock and roll party on my last birthday
But it's good, 'cause I'm rockin' my life away
My name is Jerry Lee Lewis
And I'm durned sure here to stay

I said streamline, fleetline, or military brass
You know the general's daughter
But The Killer's top class
Oh, I'm rockin'
Hey, I'm rockin' my life away
Hey! I love to Rock 'N' Roll
