Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, here we go

I'm betting you like bebop (kind of music)
And I'm betting you love freak mode
And I'm betting you like girls
That give love to girls and stroke your little ego

I bet you I'm guilty, your honor
That's just how we live in my genre
Went to hell and paid the Rottweiler
There's only one Flo and one Rida

I'm a damn shame, order more champagne
Pulled a damn ham string, trying to put it on ya
Bet your lips spin back around corner
Slow it down baby, take a little longer

Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow

You just put your lips together
