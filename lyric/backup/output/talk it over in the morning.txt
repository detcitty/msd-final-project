I disappointed you
By sayin' things i never meant to say
Now after all this time
You say you wanna throw our love away

Let's pack our troubles off to bed
Forget those awful things we said
We'll try to sleep instead
We can talk it over in the mornin'

Without you by my side
The sun might never rise
