Ether boy!!!! Hey!!!!

How we ball in the club I know you hate it
Mami dancin on the floor all like she naked
When she lay down with you I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
OHHHHHHHH!!!!! Pop champagne!
OHHHHHHHH!!!!! Pop champagne!
OHHHHHHHH!!!!! We pop champagne!
OHHHHHHHH!!!!! We pop champagne!

We need more bottles tell ma hurry up
Tell 'em Ron Browz here hottest in America
Gimme sixteen bars and you know I tear it up
Know it's me when you see this fur in your area
And she call me all night cause you can get it up
On my neck on my wrist everything is litted up
Drinkin bottles of that Clique 'till I spit it up
Only get one life so you gotta live it up
(HEY!!!) If you in the things I'm in
Shorty we can be friends, shorty we can be friends
Right now, I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
