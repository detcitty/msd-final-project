Her love, her love is, bigger

Her love, her love is, bigger
Her love, her love is, bigger
Big
Gotta believe in me
Believe me like a fairytale
Put your tooth under your pillowcase
No I won't, I won't

Have I ever let you down? (No)
Like a see-saw it's down (Oh)
You know why
'Cause we ain't in the playground
No more games
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to ride
I was a player, when I was little

But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker, when I was little
