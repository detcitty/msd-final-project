Betty Boo just [Doin' The Do]
And you are through
And there's nothing you can do

(Ooh ah, ooh ah, ooh ah, ooh ah)

(Ah) it's me again, yes, how did you guess
'Cause last time you were really impressed
And I'm bolder, c-c-cold, gettin' colder
And at the very same time I heat up at the party
And solder but not with solar power
For far too long made mistakes
And allowed a fat and ugly thing get in my way (ah)
Now I'm suitable and MC, I'm no inbetween
Top of the rank like Pearl and Dean
And if you can't take the heat get out the kitchen
Ain't got no time for your boo-boo-be

Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through, ah, and there's nothing you can do
Betty Boo, Betty Boo just doin' the do
And you are through, ah ah, and there's nothing you can do
