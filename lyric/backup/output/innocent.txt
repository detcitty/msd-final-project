Girl, girl

Hey listen girl, I can't explain
What happened to me, oh, no
I just looked at you, babe
And suddenly my body fellt weak, over you

Oh, I really should leave but I got to stay
I want you, girl, in my own way
What can I do to make you see
That I really need you too

We are innocent, oh baby girl
Innocent lover, in heat, in my life
We are innocent, sugar baby
