I met a man who would be king
He had a dream to see forever
It was a promise in the dark
It was a promise we made together
I was a girl who would be queen
I didn't know the cost of freedom
It was a secret he would share
It was a word we both could believe in
Some kind of hero
Catch me again I'm falling
'Cause I can hear you calling
