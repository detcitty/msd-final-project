I get up on Sunday, about eight-fifteen
Just to get the paper that I never read
'Cause I know she'll be there barely in her robe
Sittin' on her front porch paintin' on her toes
Her husband's always on the road

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
Your the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly
As your husband is to you
