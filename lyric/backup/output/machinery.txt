Waiting for the peace of the night to be shattered
I do believe my illusions are in tatters
When I see the pale moonlight in the sky

I know it's gonna come, like a hurricane hittin'
I breathe a sight 'coz it's only the beginning
When I see reflection deep in his eyes
I know, he's got the power to hit it

I don't believe what he said to me
