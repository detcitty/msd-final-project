If I could stick my pen in my heart
I'd spill it all over the stage
Would it satisfy ya or would slide on by ya?
Would you think this boy is strange? Ain't he strange?
If I could win you, if I could sing you
A love song so divine
Would it be enough for your cheating heart
If I broke down and cried, if I cried
I said, "I know it's only rock and roll but I like it"
