I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Oh that shit is on? Heh
Let me drop some shit like this here Real smooth

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candle sticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Four walls just staring at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleeping with my finger on the trigga
My momma's always stressing I ain't living right
But I ain't going out without a fight
See, everytime my eyes close
I start sweatin', and blood starts comin' out my nose
It's somebody watchin' the Ak'
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say "Take a chill, B"
But fuck that shit, there's a nigga trying to kill me
I'm poppin' in a clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind is playin' tricks on ya
