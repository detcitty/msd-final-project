She rolled in from the west
In a summer sun dress

Hotter than the heat in July
With her wind blown hair
It just wasn't fair
The way she was blowin' my mind
Have you ever noticed
Every hurricane gets its name from a girl like this
She's a cat. five kind
Keeps you up at night

Hangin' on to the edge of a kiss
She's a beautiful mess
The kind you love to love
But what happens next

I got a feeling when the sun comes up
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
