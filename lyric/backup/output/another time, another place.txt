Her candles flicker in the fading light
I sit alone and watch that lonely night
I see you everywhere and I try desperately to hide

another time, another place, i see that old familiar face
and i try hard to catch your eye
another road, another mile, i see that old familiar smile
but you'll be with somebody new
