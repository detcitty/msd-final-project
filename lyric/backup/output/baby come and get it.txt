You call me up at two in the morning
Honey ya burnin' up the telephone wire
You say you can't wait 'til tomorrow
And that you need me to put out your fire

I say now now now now sweet darlin'
You sure want a lot for your dime
Then you talk so, so sweet and dirty
You drive me right out of my mind
I wanna tell you no
But there I go again sayin'

Baby come and get it
Baby come and get it
