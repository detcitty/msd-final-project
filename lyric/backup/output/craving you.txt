Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go

I never had something that I can't walk away from
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience
There's something 'bout you girl I just can't fight

You're like that cigarette
That shot of proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
