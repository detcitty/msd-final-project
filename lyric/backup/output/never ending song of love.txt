Do you somehow remeber

How we gazed up at the atmosphere
And how we watched the sunset
Go and fade away?

As I walk to the future

I still keep the promise
That I made, from all those
Endless summer days.
The shadows(the shadows)

That hide behind my smile
Extend with every soul exspression.
Pretending(pretending)
That I am someone else

And giving a false impression.
