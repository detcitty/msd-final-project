(Hey...)

SPOKEN:

"You better hear what I'm sayin'
Just don't let him leave!
You better hear what I'm sayin'"

He called me up on the phone last night
Said he had a few things on his mind
He told me that things just haven't been right
I wonder where he's gonna sleep tonight

Girl, you better wake up
You better change your ways
Before the man is gone
(Hey...)
Girl, you better wise up
And stop playing games
You're going about it wrong
(Hey...)

Take my advice
Girl, you better think twice
You must think that good men are a dime a dozen
Take my advice
Girl, you better think twice
'Cause if you want to keep him...
