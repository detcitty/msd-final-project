Well, hey hey baby, tell me what's your name?
From the way you look and the way you dress
I can tell you ain't got no shame
And that's alright 'cause I'm just a man

Say you're from the city, it all moves so fast
Got your fancy cars and your diamond rings
You need a love to last
And that's alright, I'm just a man

So take me home tonight
Like you know that you should
When you're ready to be bad
Just give it, give it to me good
