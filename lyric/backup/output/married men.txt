The world is full of married men
with wives who never understand.
They're looking for someone to share
the excitement of a love affair.

And just as soon as they find you
they'll wine you and dine you.
Fly on the wings of romance.
But in the eyes of the world
you're just another girl
who loves a married man.

Uh! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it
again and again.
Ow! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it.
These married men.

Ooh, you make him feel so young,
but his wife is still number one.
He promises to marry you.
