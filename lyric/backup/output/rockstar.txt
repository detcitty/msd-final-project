I'm through with standing in line
To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be

(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house
On an episode of cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me

(So what do you need)

I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet

(been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on hollywood boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and
James Dean is fine for me

(So how you gonna do it)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
