Dear future husband,
Here's a few things you need to know if
You wanna be my one and only
All my life

Take me on a date
I deserve it, babe
And don't forget the flowers every anniversary
'Cause if you'll treat me right
I'll be the perfect wife
Buying groceries
Buy, buy what you need

You got that 9 to 5
But baby so do I
So don't be thinking I'll be at home and making apple pies
I never learned to cook
But I can write a hook,
Sing along with me
