I see what you're wearing
There's nothing beneath it
Forgive me for staring
Forgive me for breathing

We might not know why
We might not know how
But, baby, tonight
We're beautiful now

We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now

We might not know why
We might not know how
But, baby, tonight
We're beautiful now

We'll light up the sky
We'll open the clouds
