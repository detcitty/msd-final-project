I'm sitting in traffic for the fifth year in a row
Wasting my time just to get where I don't even wanna go
I started jotting things down on a Krispy Kreme sack
Everything I'd do if I could leave this place and never look back

I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
