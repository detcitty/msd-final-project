Don't let them tell you what it's all about
I'm right beside you, a dreamer you can do without
I know you well, but we've never met
Always the same, always the safe bet.

I know what's happening, I've seen it before
Uninvited, I'll be coming to your back door
Lock all your windows, hide under your bed
I hear you breathing, I know you're there

You can turn off the light
You can turn off your mind
You can shut me out

But I'll still be here
I'll still be here
You can turn me off and try to shut me down
