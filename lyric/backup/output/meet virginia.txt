She doesn't own a dress
Her hair is always a mess
You catch her stealin' she won't confess
She's beautiful

Smokes a pack a day, but wait, that's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing, about that hair
She thinks I'm beautiful
Meet Virginia

She never compromises, loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful
Meet Virginia
