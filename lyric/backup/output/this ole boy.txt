She got her smile on, dog'on nothing in the world's wrong
Rolling down a country road
She's my shotgun rider
I'm the lucky dog beside her
My lips are where her kisses go
She loves when we go to the river and get in the water
And buddy she is hotter than south Georgia in July
Man when I'm with her I can't get enough of her
I got to kiss her and I got to hug her
And brother she's mine all mine

This ole boy got it going on,
Got the good lord smiling on me
