Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

You've got some vacation time
You and your girlfriend too bad mind
Bad, bad, bad, when you're both combined
I don't know why you look so nice

Girl you're not nice, you're rude
Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, girl, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude
Look what you're putting me through
I'd never do this to you

I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One timing
I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
