Hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey
She was a disco queen
She came from New Orleans
Catfish was her name
Dancin' was her claim to fame

She took me to a fish fry
The girl danced all night
Catfish sure was nice
She makes my nature rise

Ooh, she was amazin'
She kept her guessin'
But Lord, as she danced across the floor
So tantalizin'
So satisfyin'
So hypnotizin'
So mesmerizin'
