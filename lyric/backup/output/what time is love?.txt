They're justified and they're ancient
And they like to roam the land
They're justified and they're ancient
I hope you understand

They don't want to upset the apple cart
And they don't want to cause any harm
But if you don't like what they're going to do
You better not stop them 'cause they're coming through

The notes'll flow, yo for the words I speak
Rap is weak so I teach and I preach
A positive vibe, a way of life is how I'm livin'
So get hype to the rhythm

KLF is the crew, ya hear yeah
Design a rhyme I just won't fear
Back to react, enough is enough
