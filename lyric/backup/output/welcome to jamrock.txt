Out in the streets, they call it murder

Welcome to Jamrock, camp where the thugs them camp at
Two pounds a weed inna van back
It inna your hand bag, your knapsack, it inna your back pack
The smell a give your girlfriend contact
Soundboy nuh know this, them only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals a now back too, the thugs then we do what them got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't make them spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A pure tuff things come at you
