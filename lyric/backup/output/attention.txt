Baby, you are so strong
Baby, you are calm, you are so calm, yeah
Tell me where it went wrong
Tell me how to love, it's been so long
When a call's not enough, and you just need to touch
Thinking twice on my one
But you just need to trust

You're only looking for attention
You only notice it cause I'm never around
