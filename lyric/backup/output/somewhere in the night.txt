Time, you found time enough to love
I found love enough to hold you
Tonight I'll stir the fire you feel inside
Until the flames of love enfold you

Laying beside you, lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door

Come with me
Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers shall know
You're my song
