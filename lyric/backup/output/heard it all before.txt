Baby let me explain to you I'm sayin
what you sayin
It's not even like that
It wasn't like that but I saw you
Baby I don't love her
You don't love me
you know what I don't even want to talk to you
she don't mean nothing to me
I don't want to see ya face
I just want to see you walking thourgh that door
there ain't nothing else to say
peace"

Come home late
It seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gon get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
So if you want some loving I suggest you go back there
Where you came from
Day to Day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse
See I ...

CHORUS:
Heard it all before (heard it all before)
