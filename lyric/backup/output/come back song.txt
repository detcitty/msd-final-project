I woke up again this morning
And wouldn't you know it pouring rain
I went and burned a pot of coffee
And like that I poured it down the drain

'Cause I didn't know I needed you so
And letting you go was wrong
And baby I know you got your radio on
So this is my my bad, come back song

I know I said I wouldn't miss you
But now I'm saying I'm a fool
