See, baby
I know you done had your share of girls
I am more than confident
You won't ever have to search any streets for
affection
I got you

What kind of girl you like
I know my looks can be deceivin'
Tell me am I your type
My main goal is to please you

What's on the schedule tonight
Am I the reason you'll be treatin'
I hope you have an appetite
So tell me will you come and spend the night

My love is like... wo
My kiss is like... wo
My touch is like... wo
My sex is like... wo
My ass is like... wo
My body's like... wo
And you're kissin' it
So what you think of it

My love is like... wo
My kiss is like... wo
My touch is like... wo
My sex is like... wo
My ass is like... wo
My body's like... wo
