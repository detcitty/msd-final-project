Well, it's five o'clock in the morning
Feel just like the end of a mule
Somebody's been yawning
Trying to break out the rules
Yes, it's high time we went
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went there?
Ain't it high time we went?

Well, it's four o'clock in the morning
Somebody's shouting the news
Nobody's been yawning
Preachers all around for the blues
Ain't it high time we went?
