Won't you take me back to school?
I need to learn the Golden Rule
Won't you lay it on the line?
I need to hear it just one more time

Oh, won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?

Each and every heart, it seems
Is bounded by a world of dreams
Each and every rising sun
Is greeted by a lonely one

Oh, won't you tell me again?
Oh, can you feel it?
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?
Tonight
