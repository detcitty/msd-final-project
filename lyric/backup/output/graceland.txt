Would you believe it, If I said at times I feel lost
Or if I told you, somtimes I feel I've wondered off
Into a place where I've ran out of grace
So many wrongs, have come betwen us
I've gotta fix where I am
Because I'm tuned into no graceland

I don't want to go, I don't want to go
Into no graceland, Into no graceland
Oh no, oh don't let me go
