30 thousand feet above
The city where I fell in love with you
And the fadin concrete skyline
Brings an urban lullaby
That still rings true
When I passed you on the street that day
Should've let that red scarf fly away
Like any chance I had of keeping you
Like the Northern wind a blowin’
Yeah my lonely heart is frozen
Never knew I’d find a way to break yours too

Where the wind blows babe
You can bet
I’ll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life
Just like I always did
Close your eyes babe
