Just gimme the light, yeah, yeah
Just gimme the light, yo, yo
Just gimme the light, don't say it
Just gimme the light, Sean Paul
Just gimme the light and pass the dro
Bust another bottle of moe, gal, dem in a me sight
And I gots know which one is gonna catch my flow
'Cause I'm in a the vibes and I got my dough
Bust another bottle of moe, girl, dem lookin' hype
And I gots to know
Could I be your protector? Your buff in every sector?
Everyman around dem wanna turn your inspector
But you no let them sweat ya, no grill you with no lecture
