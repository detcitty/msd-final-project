Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
They're called the Ghost busters and they're in control
Had 'em throwin' a party for a bunch of children
While all of the while the slime was under the building

So they packed up their group, got a grip, came equipped
Grabbed they Proton packs off their back and they split
Found about Vigo, the master of evil
Try to battle my boys? That's not legal

Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance
Yeah, I think this is gonna be another one of those funky ones
Heart, soul, dance
Yeah, I think this is gonna be another one of those funky ones

If I was you, and you were me, you'd wanna be winnin'
If you want somethin' bad, yo, you gotta wanna give your all
'Cause I believe so much in we and know we're not kiddin'
If you feel the same as me, yo, you gotta want to take the ball

Now I find out that nothin' is given
