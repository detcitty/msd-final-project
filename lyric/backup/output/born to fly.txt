I've been telling my dreams to the scarecrow
About the places that I'd like to see
I say, friend, do you think I'll ever get there
Oh, but he just stands there smiling back at me

So I confessed my sins to the preacher
About the love I've been praying to find
Is there a brown-eyed boy in my future, yeah
And he says, girl, you've got nothing but time
