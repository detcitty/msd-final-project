I've settled down
A twisted up frown
Disguised as a smile
Well, you would have never known
I had it all, but not what I wanted
Cause hope for me was a place uncharted
And overgrown

You'd make your way in
I'd resist you just like this
You can't tell me to feel
The truth never set me free
So I did it myself

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
