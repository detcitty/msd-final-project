Yeah, ooh, yeah
They let us in the rap game

I swear they let me in this motherfucking rap game
Got a chick, I call her Lola
She feel like the ocean
Likes to drink and smoke some doja
And I feel like smokin'
Plus she good at charmin' cobras
I feel like I'm chosen
But she ain't the only one, no
Got a chick, I call her Katia
She be actin bougie
The she came through
And topped me off
Now she just a groupie
