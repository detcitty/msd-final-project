Dontcha look now oh the parkin lots full
Gonna ride that cow with a Dallas bull 
Everybody in the ATL is comin
DJs got those speakers thumpin
Got a black ford not a white mercedes
Walkin in the front door checkin out the ladies
My buddy says hey boys I'm buyin
The hottest girl in here's givin me the eye and.

Everybody knows, its gonna be one of those
I can drink to that all night
Thats the stuff I like
Thats the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high
Bout to tie one on talkin gone gone gone
Turnin all the wrongs into right
I can drink to that all night
