Well, I've spent a lifetime lookin' for you;
singles bars and good time lovers were never true.
Playin' a fools game hopin' to win;
and tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again.

I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
Lookin' for love in too many faces,
searchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces
of what I'm dreamin' of.

Hopin' to find a friend and a lover;
I'll bless the day I discover
another heart lookin' for love.

And I was alone then, no love in sight;
