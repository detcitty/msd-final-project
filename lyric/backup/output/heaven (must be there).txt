Ooh
Ooh, I want to find a better place
Ooh
Ooh, I'm searching for a better place

Ooh
Ooh, I'm tired of living in the sand
Ooh
Ooh, I'm searching for a better land

Heaven, must be there-ere
Well, it's just got to be there-ere
I've never, never seen Eden
I don't wanna live in this place

Ooh
Ooh, I'm always trying to escape
