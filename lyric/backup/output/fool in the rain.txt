Oh baby

Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shinin'
Like a star that can't wait for night.
I hate to think I been blinded baby.
Why can't I see you tonight?
An' the warmth of your smile starts a burnin'
An' the thrill of your touch give me fright
And I'm shakin' so much, really yearnin'.
Why don't you show up and make it alright-yeah?
It's alright-right.

And if you promised you'd love so completely
An' you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me baby
Whatever happened to you?
An' you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true, hey.
It ain't the first time believe me baby
