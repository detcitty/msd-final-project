Tearing me apart
Somehow I just don't care
She? s playing with my heart
But Janet? s so aware

And people tell me, she keeps telling you lies
I guess they wonder how I stand it, oh
But when I look in her eyes
I know it? s love the way I planned it, I believe in Janet

Janet, they don? t understand it
The whole world must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
