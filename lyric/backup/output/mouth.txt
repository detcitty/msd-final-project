I feel like I've been blown apart, there are pieces here
I don't know where they go, I don't know where they go
Kiss me on my salty lips, I bet you feel a little crazy
But for me, we'll be famous on TV

Would it be my fault if I could turn you on?
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
And turn you upside down, don't want to waste it
