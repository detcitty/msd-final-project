Go go

Don't wanna know about vacations in this cheap motel
Don't wanna know about your sea green curtains
Cos all I want 'n' all I need is just some time with you
Don't complicate it - Just do it once again

Just go for it
Just go for the second time
Just go for it, just go - just go

Don't wanna hear about the time and how it's gettin' late
