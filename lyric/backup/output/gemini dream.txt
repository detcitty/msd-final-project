Long time no see
Show time for you and me
So fine, So good
We're on the road
Like you knew we would

First night, so long
A state of mind
What can go wrong
We're here, the time is right
To rock 'n' roll
Right through the n-n-night

Make it work out
Make it work
Make it work out
Make it work out
For each other tonight

Stage fright, candle light
