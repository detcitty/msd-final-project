Let all the heat pour down.
I'm good as long as he's around.
He let's me wear the crown.
I do my best to make him proud.

Now all my super ladies.
I got my baby.
If you got your baby, baby.

Move your body, move your body.
Dance for your papi.
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air air air
Woahh ohh ohh
Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi

My rock is shining bright
Even if he ain't by my side
He'll make sure that I glow
