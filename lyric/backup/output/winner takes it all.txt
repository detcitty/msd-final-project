I
Watch with open eyes
Till it's time
To take it all the way, hey

Everyday
The game is ours to play
Oh, tell me why
There are no alibis

'Cause winner takes it all
Loser takes a fall
Fight to the beginning of the end

Winner takes it all
Till he breaks the fall
In time he'll make it over the top
Hey
