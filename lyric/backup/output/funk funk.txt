Get up, we are eternal funk
Alias the phemaldehyde funkmen
You can't see us but you can feel us

Get up on the funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
Feel it begin to rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
If you're tired of the same ol' sound
Get up on the Cameo sound

'Cause we are living funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
Come on, dig the funky horns
