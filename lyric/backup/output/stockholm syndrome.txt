Who's that shadow holding me hostage?
I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me
That I'm never gonna get away?

I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear, I'm getting used to
Being held by you

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you've got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way
