I wanna know your name
Mm-mmm
Ooo, you look so good
I wanna know your name
What's your name, baby
I'd love ya, if I could

'Cause, you're the kind of girl
That I adore
And you're the kind of girl
I've been looking for

Hey, where do you live
Where do you live, baby
I'd like to take you home
What do I have to give
What do I have to give
To call you on the phone

'Cause, you're the kind of girl
That I adore
And you're the kind of girl
I've been looking for

Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Just tell me your name, please tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Ain't never seen nothin' as sweet as you
(I wanna know your name)
