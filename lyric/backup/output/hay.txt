Sittin on a quarter 'p of hay
Thangs is feelin good today.
I'm tore up, from the floor up
Sippin on some crown royal.
Trippin, in a circle of wood
Where everybody smoke they own bud.
Good ole' hay
How you feel today?
Fine, blowed and dandy.
Silly like i'm hype off candy.
Gotta big, thick chic named sandy.
In the farm in the middle of the barn
Where everybody's feelin crazy.
I went to visit granny's house.
Now i see why don't nobody leave.
We constantly, constantly, constantly smokin b's.
Too blitzed to even shake it off
But i still got my head up.
Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn
And get my big black peter sucked
Pass the hay you silly slut,
Blaze it up so i can hit that bud.
Git me zoned and i'll be on.
Cuz i love to smoke upon hay.

(chorus)
Smokin on
Haaayy in the middle of the barn.
Smokin on
Haaayy in the middle of the barn.

The hay got me goin through a stage
And i just can't get enough.
Smokin everyday
I got some hay
And you know i'm finna roll it up.
