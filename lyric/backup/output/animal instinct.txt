On my back
you're on my track

I can feel you creeping up on me.
Such a hungry love on the hunt

Stalking through the night
we're running wild.
In your eyes I'm the prize

in the lion's den I can't get free.
Now we're alone
don't let me go

'Cause you're bringing out the savage beast in me.

My scent's in the air
it's everywhere

I'm gonna be your prey tonight.
I've given up the chase
I'm ready to be tamed
