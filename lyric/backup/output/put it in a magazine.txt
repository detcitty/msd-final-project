It's just another night
Shining through
I've got to turn off the lights
I think I'm through

I'm all worn down
From my nine-to-five
It's heavy on me

And when I fall asleep
Dream about love, oh, baby

Here comes the dawn
And the dream is gone
But I keep on holding on

Gonna put it in a magazine
Tell the world
About my love for you
Gonna put it in a magazine
Just to prove that
My love is true

Still another day
Comes passing through
Don't want to make me stay
I've made plans with you
