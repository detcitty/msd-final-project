Ooh, ooh, ooh
If I had to paint a picture
To show the world how love can really be
I would use the brightest colours
To create a vision of harmony

It would be a reality
'Cause it's only what's inside of my heart
You would see I've always loved you
Right from the very start

Tell me what is the colour of love?
What do you see?
Is it warm, is it tender
When you think of me
I'll see the colour of love
When I'm thinking of you
