One, two, three and to the fo'
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the do'
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
'Cause you know we're 'bout to rip, shit up

Gimme the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nuttin' but a G thang, baby, two loc'ed out niggaz so we're crazy
'Death Row', is the label that pays me
Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this
(Hell, yeah)

But uhh, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective and before me dig out
A bitch I have to find a contraceptive

You never know she could be earnin' her man
And learnin' her man and at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it

And that's realer than real deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff
