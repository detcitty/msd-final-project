You worked two jobs
To keep a roof up over our heads
You chose a life for me, no you never gave up
I admire you for the strength you've instilled in me

You were so young
You were just my age when you had me
Mom, you were so brave
There was nothing that would stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me

So when you're lost and you're tired

When you're broken in two

Let my love take you higher

Cause I, I still turn to you
