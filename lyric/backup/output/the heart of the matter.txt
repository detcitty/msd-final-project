I got the call today, i didn't wanna hear
But i knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And i thought of all the bad luck,
And the struggles we went through
And how i lost me and you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

I'm learning to live without you now
But i miss you sometimes
The more i know, the less i understand
All the things i thought i knew, i'm learning again
I've been tryin' to get down to the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
