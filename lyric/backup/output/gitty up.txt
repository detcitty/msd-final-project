Gitty up, babe

You can buy that
Full of bass and hi-hat
You can buy that
Full of bass and hi-hat

I'm, ah, make you bounce till your hip hurts, make you work
Sweat till you drench your blouse and your skirt
And I'm-a freak you till you pass out
Pay cash out, baby, tear your back out, keep bangin'
Ho, B.L.A.Q. make you say, ho, S and P, chi-ca, chi-co
Everybody put your hands in the sky
Gitty up, gitty up, let's ride

Gitty up baby, say what
(Gitty up, gitty up)
Give me all that you got, baby, don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what

Gitty up baby, say what
(Gitty up, gitty up)
Give me all that you got, baby, don't stop
Keep it comin' strong, make it hot, say what

Gitty up baby, I'm, ah, take you for a ride
It makes your soul wild, when I release vibes
Freak ya down 'til your asthma hit ya
Salt, non-stop styles, lift ya
Make you wanna get your stash
Rollin' like a Ben, no need
Got my own end, payer-haters never win
'Cuz I'm involved to the end
Send chill up your skin, Poppie

Who debate, not me
