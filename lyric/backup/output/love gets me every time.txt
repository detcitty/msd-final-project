Life was going great
Love was gonna have to wait
Was in no hurry, had no worries
Staying single was the plan
Didn't need a steady man
I had it covered, 'til I discovered

That love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
And I gol' darn gone and done it, hoo

Gone and done it (gone and done it)
I guess I fell in love (gone and done it)
