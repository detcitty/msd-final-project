Tonight, we're all alone tonight,
theres never been a moment
that trembles like tonight.
I read ur eyes tonight,
I see a love I always known
From another time
That once again is mine,
I need to know
are you real?
Do you feel the way I feel?
Could you love?
Like I love you
say you can and
say you do

Say you'll stay,
Say your sure,
Say my heart was made for yours.
