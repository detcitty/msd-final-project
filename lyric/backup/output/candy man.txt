When I wake up in the mornin’
You bring me breakfast in my bed
And when I need a little sugar
That’s when you go to my head

You’re the sweetest (Candy man) man I know
And I’ll never let you go
Just say you’ll stay (Candy Man) with me forever
And our love will surely grow, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You can be my candy man
Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
‘Cause I really know you can
Hey... hey...

Candy man
Candy man
Ooh... hoo...

When you wake up in the mornin’
And affection’s on your mind
