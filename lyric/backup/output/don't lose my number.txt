They came at night leaving fear behind
Shadows were on the ground

Nobody knew where to find him
No evidence was found
"I'm never coming back"
They heard him cry and I believe him

Well he never meant to do anything wrong
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long
Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you

Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh no
Searching through the day and into the night
They wouldn't stop till they found him
