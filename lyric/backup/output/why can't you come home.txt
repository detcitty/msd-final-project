You're treating me like a limousine
And you drivin' me out of my mind, yeah
Why you wanna do that to me, baby?
You tellin' my friends to cause a scene
And embarassed me all the time, yeah

But what am I suposse to say, what suppose to do
When I love someone, I've got to be loving you, oh
You stay out every night, and that just ain't right
You must take me for a fool, yeah

Don't treat me wrong too long
Baby, I just can't not hang on
If you love me like I love you,
Why can't you come home?

Why can't you come home?
Home to my love
