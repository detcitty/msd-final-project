Wanted, young man single and free
Experience in love preferred, but will accept a young trainee
Oh I'm gonna put it in the want ads, I need a love that's true
Gonna put it in the want ads, my man and I are through

At home I find myself, lost and all alone
My man is playing the field, the thrill is gone
He stays out all night, says he's with the boys
But lipstick on his collar, perfume on it too
