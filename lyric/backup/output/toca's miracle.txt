If you're gonna save the day

And you're hearin' what I say

I feel your touch
your kiss
It's not enough
And if you believe in me

Don't think my love's for free
I won't take nothin' less
then a deeper love
Let me tell you
know
I...
I need a miracle

I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need
To feel from you
Let me tell you

Know
I...
I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
