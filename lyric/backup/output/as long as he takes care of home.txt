Just wait a minute, honey
I've got some rap for you

You know you been running
All over town with my man
Telling my friends about
You gonna take my man away from me

But you see
If I can't hold him
Ha, I don't need him
Let me tell you something

I don't care where he goes
Or if he's been with you
Or what he does while he's gone
Or who he's doing it to

I don't mind him having
A little fun with you, honey
Because I know I'm the girl
That's spending his money

I don't feel like, ooh
