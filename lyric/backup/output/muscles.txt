She said she wants a man
To always understand
But that's alright for her
Still it ain't enough for me

She said she wants a guy
To keep her satisfied
But that's alright for her
But it ain't enough for me

Still, I don't care if he's young or old
(Just make him beautiful)
I just want someone I can hold on to

I want muscles
All, all over his body
(Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes)
I want muscles
All, all over his body
(Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes)
