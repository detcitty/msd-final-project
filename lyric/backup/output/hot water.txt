Tell me something
Why do I always find it hard
Just to get along
Try my best for nothing
Every little thing I do is wrong

Feel it in my brain
Driving me insane
Round and round
The same old tune

Daddy's on the phone
You know you're not alone
Turn that down
And clean up your room

Sons and daughters
(Don't fall in)
In hot water
Sons and daughters
(They don't do)
