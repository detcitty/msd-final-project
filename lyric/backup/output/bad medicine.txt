Your love is like bad medicine

Bad medicine is what I need
Shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease

It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy

I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
I got all the symptoms count 'em 1, 2, 3
First you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)

On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
Now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug
