I need love, love,
Ooh, ease my mind
And I need to find fine
Someone to call mine

My mama said "You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said "Love don't come easy
But It's a game of give and take"

"You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in the good time
No matter how long it takes"

How many heartaches must I stand?
Before I find the love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
Is to feel my strength, you know it's almost gone
