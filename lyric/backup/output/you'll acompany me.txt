A gypsy wind is blowing warm tonight
The sky is starlit and the time is right
And still you're tellin' me you have to go
Before you leave there's something you should know
Yeah something you should know babe

I've seen you smiling in the summer sun
I've seen your long hair flying when you run
I've rnade my mind up that it's meant to be
