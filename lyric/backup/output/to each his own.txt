(CHORUS)
The best of business
In the line of business
Is to mind your business
So mind your business
If you got no business
Then make it your business
To leave other people's
Business alone
To each his own
That's my philosophy

I don't know
What's right for you
No, no, no, no
And you don't know
What's right for me, woo

Shoo bop bop bop bop
Do your thing
Come on, everybody

Shoo doop do do do
Do your thing
Why don't you
Why don't you

Sha la la la la
Do your thing
Do it like you wanna

Shoo boom boom boom boom
Do your thing
