An only child alone and wild
A cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant
For different work

And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone
And solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know

I never can repay
A quiet man of music
Denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once

But his music wouldn't wait
