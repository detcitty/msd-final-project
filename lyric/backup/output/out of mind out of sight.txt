Hey hey honey when I'm without you
I get a chill up and down my spine
And I, I feel so hot and the pain won't stop
Tearing at this heart of mine
And I wouldn't have it, I know I can say
And I wouldn't have it any other way

Do you like to make love with me or turn it around?
Do you like the way it feels when I hold you tight?
Do you like the way I say I'm coming on home?
I'd get you when I want you then you're on your own
