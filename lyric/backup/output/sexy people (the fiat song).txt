When I hear the ocean calling
and I feel my spirit falling
I remember old
where I'd fall in love with you.

Lovin' romance in the garden

Yes!
It's the immigrants,
taking over.
Mister World Wide,
fly yo Arianna, salute
Let's have some fun!

When I hear the ocean calling
Sexy people,.
Sexy people,.
Sexy people,.
Sexy people,.
Sexy people,.

I was born in Miami, my blood is from Cuba
