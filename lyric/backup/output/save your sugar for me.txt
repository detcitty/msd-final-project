The bus is on the road
Sweet Georgia fades away
We'll be burnin' down Louisiana
By the very next day

No, sleep will never take me
My mind is stuck on you
Oh you'd better be laying awake
Thinking of me too

I'll ask one thing(I'll ask one thing)
Not that you'd be true(Not that you'd be true)
The thing I'm asking of you

Save me some sugar
This won't take long
I won't promise to stay the night
I won't sing you no song
