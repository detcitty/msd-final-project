We used to play out in the rain
Your mother scolded us
She said that we were bad
(She said that we were bad)

I thought I better go on home
You watched till I was gone
Ooh, girl, you looked so sad

I picked you up when you fell
And cut your knee
I told you not to cry
And held you close to me

As I was running
Through the storm
To get my umbrella
