I'd like to dedicate this right here
To my favorite girl
I know I haven't been the most perfect man
But I love you, God knows, I do
Why...

(Verse 1)
What's wrong with your shady ass
Wakin' me up early in the mornin' still yawnin'
Don't you know a nigga half sleep
So why the hell you keep on pagin' me
I told you once before
I'm gonna say it once again
Don't you call no more
My girl is lyin' next to me
Do you think this is a game
Why you testin' me
You keep on stressin' me

(Chorus 1)
You keep callin' me
