Walking round with my head down
But I can't hide with these high heels on
Downtown in a thick crowd
But it's just you that my mind is on
Dressed up, got my heart messed up
You got yours and I got mine
It's unfair that I still care
And I wonder where you are tonight

Thinking it could be different
But maybe we missed it yea
Thinking it could be different
It could, it could

It should've been us
Shoulda been a fire, shoulda been the perfect storm
It should've been us
Coulda been the real thing, now we'll never know for sure, ooh
We were crazy, but amazing, baby we both know
It should've been us, us
It, it, it should've been us
