Uh, first verse, uh, I'm on till I'm on an island
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form
Slap up a cop and then snatch 'im out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hangin' by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past
So that basically resurrected my cash flow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s, my '90s was like the Navy

You was like the Bradys, you still fly kites daily
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' Ice Ice Baby
Screamin' Shady 'til I die, like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll
(Damn)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is
'Cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum cleanin'
Try them trailer parks, crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back with a capital "B" with an exclamation mark
