Ho, Ho, Ho
(I know I ain't hear somebody say
nuthin about hoes up in here, sshhh, ooh lord)

What's up Dallas, what's up Dallas jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
What's up San Antone, what's up San Antonio jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
What's up Austin, what's up Austin jump on it, jump on it, jump on it
What's up Houston, what's up Houston jump on it, jump on it, jump on it (Ooh lord)

Welcome to the 2 1 4
Big B, D Texas
Let mr. sexes flex this lexus
And this where the cowboys play
They battle with my team from the bay
Frisco
Now I'm from the northwest
But I likes my soul food
So I'm calling up an old groove
And I'm a brother with a gut
So, hello Keana, can ya take us out to Pappadeux
And don't forget about San Antone
The last time I went thru
I took three broads home
And much love love to the brothers in Austin
And the 5 1 2
I'm flossin in Lawston
A state that's as big as hell
