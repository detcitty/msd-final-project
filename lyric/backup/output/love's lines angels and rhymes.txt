Love leads the lines of love in circles and angles
Love runs deep like a tunnel with a pendulum beat
That touches the heart in many directions
Moving the mind in silent reflection
Of the lines that touch the corners and fibers
Of the feeling that keeps running inside you
Cycles of fears with the longing and tears
Lettin' out the needs and laughter of sunshine, love shine
Touching the fibers of the feeling inside you
Letting out the things you hide, ohh yeah
Need leads the lines of love in circles and angles
