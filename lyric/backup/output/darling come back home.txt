This is a heart 
That used to feel the joy of waking 
I was thankful for each flower every tree.
These are eyes that used to see each new day breakin' and believe it was a gift from God to me.

I have felt these things inside, with you by my side 
Since you've gone and left me, everything beautiful has died.

Come back home
