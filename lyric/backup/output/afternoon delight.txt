Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some Afternoon Delight
My motto's always been "When it's right, it's right."
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?

When everythings a little clearer in the light of day?
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway?

Thinkin 'bout you's working up my appetite
Lookin' forward to a little Afternoon Delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
