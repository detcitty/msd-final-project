Said a small boy once
asked:"When will I grow up?"
When will I see what grownups do see?"
And he's bout to come his age
he will act another age
to be reconized is
quite another mess

And mama used to say:
"Take your time young man"
And mama used to say:
"Don't you rush to get old"
And mama used to say:
"Take it in your stride"
And mama used to say:
"Live your life"

As the years where rushing by
