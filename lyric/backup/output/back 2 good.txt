It's nothing, it's so normal
You just stand there, I could say so much
But I don't go there 'cause I don't want to
I was thinking, if you were lonely
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know
At least not to the point that we would think so

And everyone here knows everyone here is thinking about somebody else
Well it's best if we all keep it under our heads
I couldn't tell if anyone here was feeling the way I do
