All you got it this moment
Twenty-first centurys yesterday
You can care all you want
Everybody does, yeah, that's ok

So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
You're one of my kind

I need you tonight
Cause I'm not sleeping
Theres something about you girl
