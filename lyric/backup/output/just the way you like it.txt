You have been single for a long time
And I don't wanna cramp your style
Still you insist you want to settle down
But I know better, you can't change years over night
And asking that, I would never do
So here's the solution that comes to mind

As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you, just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
