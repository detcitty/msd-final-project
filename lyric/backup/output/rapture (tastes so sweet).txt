La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la

The night I laid my eyes on you
I felt everything around me move
Got nervous when you looked my way
But you knew all the words to say

And your love slowly moved right in
All this time, oh my love, where you been

Mi amore
Don't you know?
My love I want you so
Sugar
You make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet
