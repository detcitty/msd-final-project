If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop

If you start me up
If you start me up I'll never stop
I've been running hot
You got me ticking gonna blow my top
If you start me up, if you start me up
I'll never stop, never stop, never stop, never stop

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
