There ain't nothin' like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothin' like the real thing
There ain't nothin' like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothin' like the real thing

I see your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame
