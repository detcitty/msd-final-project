Since that cop can't see his eyes, who could it be?
With the newest STL or who that but me
Who else with us behind the the tint or the new GT
The continental on blow got them feeling real glo
Till they stomachs stick to, furr real, they grossed out
19's I come, 22's poke out
Just to see when they roll out, I'm killin the folks now
His money just chingy, my money it fold out
Man, this happened vegas, and they hit me for a mil' worth
How many rappers man can tell you what a mil' worth
