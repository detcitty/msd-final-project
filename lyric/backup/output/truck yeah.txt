Got Lil' Wayne pumpin' on my iPod
Pumpin' on the subs in the back of my crew cab
Redneck rockin' like a rockstar
Sling a lil' mud off the back, we can do that
Friday night football, Saturday Last Call, Sunday Hallelujah
If you like it up loud and you're hillbilly proud
Then you know what I'm talking about

Let me hear you say, Truck Yeah
Wanna get it jacked up yeah
Let's crank it on up yeah
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a Truck Yeah
We can love it on up yeah
