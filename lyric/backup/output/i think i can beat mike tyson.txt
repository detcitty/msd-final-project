2 old men:

No no you old coop, he a... he a boxer man

Yeah

Let me tell ya I went to his fight a couple months ago.
I seen him hit this boy, and he hit the boy so hard
His head flew off into the eigtheenth row

(laughing)

They had to get his head out of the eighteenth row

[Prince & Jeff]
I was in Jeff's crib one night about eight
And we were watchin'a couple of Mike Tyson fight tapes
Jeff was like...

Man, you see how hard Mike's punchin'?

Come on Jeff the other guy was just lungin'
Left, right, left, right, another K.O.
If that was me I'd a been ok though
The very next day I gave Russell a ring
With J.L. and Omar we all called Don King
I said 'yeah, Don I got a problem

Tell 'em Prince

'yeah what's up? what you sayin? you tryin' to solve 'em?'
'forget the small talk let's get to the nitty gritty'
'me and Mike, two months, Trump, Atlantic City'

Yo, you got this you gonna bust dude up

Yeah, you can be my trainer

Word up?

I'm rough like a freight train smooth like ice
And yo Jeff, straight up, I think I can Mike Tyson

Man, you can beat him, you can beat him

Yo man, word up
Yo I put on a couple of pounds man we can do this

You can do it
