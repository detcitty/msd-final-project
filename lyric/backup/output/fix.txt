Clap, clap, clap, clap
If you need a fix, yeah
If you need a fix, baby, I got it

And you say Blackstreet, and you say
Clap your hands, just clap your hands
Just clap your hands, just clap

Oh, sugar girl, you sexy thing
I like the way you swing
I always wanna be your lover
I always wanna be your lover

You can call me
If you need a fix or two
Girl, you know how we do
I got to get with you

You can get me on the phone
Dial my number, I'll be waiting
When I see you, we'll be anticipating
All I want to do is drive you crazy, girl
If we can flow, baby, let's go see me tonight

If you need a fix
Let me be the one you can call on
If you wanna fix
I can give you what you need
