Yeah, yeah, mmm
I was born under a bad sign
Left out in the cold
I'm a lonely man who knows
Just what it means to lose control

But I took all the heartache
And turned it to shame
Now I'm moving moving on
And I ain't taking the blame

Don't come running to me
I know I've done all I can
A hard loving woman like you
Just makes a hard loving man
