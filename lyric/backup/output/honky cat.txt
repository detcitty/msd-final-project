When I look back
Boy, I must have been green
Boppin' in the country
Fishin' in a stream

Lookin' for an answer
Tryin' to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights
Honey, I was blind

They said, get back, Honky Cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, oh change is gonna do me good

You better get back, Honky Cat
Livin' in the city ain't where it's at
It's like tryin' to find gold in a silver mine
It's like tryin' to drink whiskey
