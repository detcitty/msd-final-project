Chorus 2X: Musiq]
Comin' to break you off(we gettin' started... start-started.)
Comin' to break you off(we gettin' started... start-started.)
Comin' to break you off, happy(we gettin' started... start-started.)

Coming to break you off

[Verse One: Black Thought]
Bad Misses, Throwin raspberry kisses on me
You looking for direction
Girl I feel your vision on me
Just dont let him see you sweatin
we aint spose to be involved
Knowing when we get it off, Girl I mean it off
Keeping you fiending 'til you taking it tossed
And when I'm breaking it off
Its no denying the fact it's wrong
'Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason you're gone, Uh
Is it because he's superficial
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it 'cause you really couldnt see a future with him
All he bout is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
And get stripped and shown, the way the getting is on
The cost, dealing with this you only taking a loss
You need to leave him alone
And roll with the one who breaking you off

[Chorus 2X: Musiq]
Off...
Comin' to break you off(we gettin' started... start-started.)
Comin' to break you off(we gettin' started... start-started.)
Comin' to break you off, happy(we gettin' started... start-started.)

Comin' to break you off

[verse three: black thought]
brother down the hall
the one you bound to call
workaholics who really are rarely around at all
when we started got serious reprocussions and cost
we had a chance to turn back but love that was lost
late nights twistin somethin
listenin to niecie sing
she got the beat for you tell me you deeply
appreciate the company and time we spend
i feel the same its a shame you aint may girlfriend
cuz listen
you need a brother with that physical fix
that come through in the mix for you with no head tricks
and for
you need a new position
and who can get you open
