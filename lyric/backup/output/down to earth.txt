Ohhh, ohhh, oh
I never thought that it'd be easy
Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us and we're wondering how

No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart.
So we fight, (so we fight)

Through the hurt, (through the hurt)
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live, (and we live)
And we learn, (and we learn)

And we try and try and try and try!
So its up to you, (oh)
And its up to me, (yeah)
and we meet in the middle, on our way back down to earth

Down to earth, down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down to earth
