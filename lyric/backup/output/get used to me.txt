Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe

And then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer
Oh, in every visit
Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands

Our love is here to stay

So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
There ain't a moment
I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, oh and oh
Get used to me holding you
