Last night a little dancer
came dancing to my door
Last night a little angel
came pumping on the floor
She said, come on baby
You got a license for love
And if it expires
pray help from above, because
in the midnight hour
she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell
she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe
more, more, more
With a rebel yell
more, more, more, more, more, more
She don't like slavery
she won't sit and beg
