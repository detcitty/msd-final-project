Ain't no more Motown Review
And The Beatles have broken up too
British band have gone back
Colored kids are now black
And love has changed into brand new

Ain't no more Motown Review
And The Beatles have broken up too
JFK has been shot
We miss him a lot
He always knew what to do

Ain't no more Rock & Roll shows
On the road, now it's Disco
Television's no longer live
Now it's taped
Ahead of time

Kids don't sit in movies no more
Holding hands, no romance
And lovers don't kiss in balconies
All they do is dance so free

Ain't no bottles of Coke made with glass
That's all past
Nobody wears dungarees
Now it's jeans
If you please

Ain't no more Motown Review
And The Beatles are broken up too
