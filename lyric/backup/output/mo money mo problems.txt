Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Who's jewels got rocks, who's mostly Dolce down
To the tube sock? The same old pimp
Mase, you know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales call it level up
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me 91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cooter schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And when you yell, "there go Mase!" there go your cutie
