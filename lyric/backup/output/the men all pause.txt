I know I was lookin' good, I had my Kenneth Cole shoes on
My Gianni Versace blue leather suit
My nails were done and my hair was fierce
And I was riding in a Cooper's limousine, don't you want to ride?

I was at home feelin' sleazy
So I went down to the speak easy
As soon as my feet hit the door
I had all attention from the dance floor

Don't you know the men all pause?
When I walked into the room the men all pause
The men all pause when I walked into the room
The men all pause and the brides held their grooms

And they all sang the same old tune
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa check me out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Starin' faces startin' to get tired
I wanted to get out and go for a ride
