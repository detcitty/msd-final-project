Hi, I'm John Waters, and this is the Creep!

When you're out at a club and you see a fly girl
Do the creep (haaaa)
Do the creep (haaaa)
And if you wanna make friends at the ATM
Do the creep (haaaa)
And do the creep (haaaa)

Well we got a new dance, so get up on your feet
It's real easy to do and it's called the creep
Let your hands flop round like a marionette
Pop your knees up and down sh-sh-shakin' your neck
Now pull your waistband up like you expecting a flood
And stick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud
Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers
