He is sensible and
So incredible and
All my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear

And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door
And I get into his car

And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting
And kissing in the rain
And it's 2 am and I'm cursing your name

You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
