Here's a song I want
Everybody to listen to
It's talking about love
And it's talking about hate

You know, I think the only way
We're gonna do away with hate is
To get so much love going around
That there just won't be any more hate

There's so much hate going on today
On the right and on the left
You see, we hate our brothers
Yes, we do, and we hate our own self
