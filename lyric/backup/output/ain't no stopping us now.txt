We'll be road tripping rolling with the top down south bound little bikinis and white sand

Cant sleep gotta leave
Summer sun starting to peak
Through my window letting me know
times up and its time that we go
Got a lead foot waiting and a pocket full of cash
cooler full of beer and a little something stash
in the back
Of the car
so relaxed there aint a beach too far

We'll be road tripping rolling with the top down south bound little bikinis and white sand
and tank top gonna let the guns out
