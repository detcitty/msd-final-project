You and I, 'til the day we die. (day we die.)

Yo, yo
Ex-girlfriend, how you been? I see you still
tryin to fuck with other women men, remember when
I first met you in my cousin's house, a week later
we was fuckin on your momma couch, now it's been said
that big girls they don't cry, but they damn sure lie
Look you in the eye, sayin you they only
You and I, til the day we die, said you'd never
leave me lonely, fly tenderoni but you phony
Shoulda listened when my momma told me, soon as I
turn my back you try to fuck my homies, that was then
this is now I got a new friend, ever since
I cut them loose ends you wanna bone me
Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice
about leavin the wife even, picture that
