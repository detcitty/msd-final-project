There's a face in the mirror
And you close your eyes
Much easier to run away
Than you take a look inside
So you're thinking it's over
Walking away
Let your little world crash n' burn
Oh what a price to pay

Didn't anybody tell you
It's not who's right or wrong
Hold the line
Is this what's going on

Where you goin' now
When your world's turned inside out
Isn't love what it's all about
Where you goin' now
When you get to the top of the hill
