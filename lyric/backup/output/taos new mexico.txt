My mamma wrote a letter in she said:
"Son, you beter hurry, get home quick.
Maria's tired of waitin' and you know she started datin',
then she's got her kick"
Here I am in jail with no-one to pull my bail
and I just wanna go home.
And when I do I'll never leave Maria alone

I'm serving time Taos, New Mexico.
