Now write this down!

I'll never be your beast of burden.
My back is broad, but it's a' hurtin'.
All I want is for you to make love to me.

I'll never be your beast of burden.
I walk for miles, my feet are hurtin'.
All I want is for you to make love to me.

What's the matter with me?
Ain't I hot enough? Ain't I rough enough?
