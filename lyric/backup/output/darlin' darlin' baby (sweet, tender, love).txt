You're my darlin', darlin', baby
You're my darlin', darlin', love
You're my darlin', darlin', baby
I said, you're everything I ever hoped for in a woman
And as long as I may live
Uh, you're my darlin', darlin', baby
You're my sweet and tender love
You're a very special lady
I said, you're the one that I always dreamed of in a woman
I'll give all that I can give
I'll give you plenty of love
Because you deserve the best
You should everything, a queen sittin' on a throne should have
You deserve to have it all
And I'm gonna do my best
To give it to you, to give it to you, to give it to you
