Turn around, make your move
Turn around, make your move
Turn around, make your move

I can feel you staring, your eyes undressing me
Every time I'm near you boy, my heart skips a beat
Stop anticipating, don't play hide and seek
My love's for the taking if you're playing for keeps

Every little thing you do
Is saying that you want me, too
But you keep your heart behind the wall of ice
Every single breath you take
Is another second that you waste
I don't like the shy boys
Open up your eyes boy

Turn around, make your move
Wait too long and you might lose
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine
Turn around, make your move
Nothing's wrong, just say you do
Don't you wanna be mine, Don't you wanna be miine

yeeah, do it now
