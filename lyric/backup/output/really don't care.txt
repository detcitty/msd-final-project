You wanna play, you wanna stay, you wanna have it all
You started messin' with my head until I hit the wall
Maybe I should've known, maybe I should've known
That you would walk, you would walk out the door, hey

Said we we're done and met someone and brought it in my face
Cut to the part, she broke you're heart and then she ran away
I guess you should've known, I guess you should've known
That I would talk, I would talk

But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh, oh, oh, I really don't care!

Even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
