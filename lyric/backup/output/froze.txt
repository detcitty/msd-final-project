'm a rockstar, smash my guitar
Diamonds on my fist and on my arms
Meek and I don't dress the same, relate in Goyard
Frostbite on my pinky ring, watch me flex on y'all

I get it now, these niggas mad that she chose the kid
I'm ball in NY, Derrick Rose this shit
I roll around town in a Rolls and shit
I got that bag and we movin' that snow like it's Christmas and Santa, got hoes and shit
Hundred K large on my Audemar
When we run down we hit one of y'all
I'mma post up at the corner store
Trappin' all night but I shine like I'm Armor All
I am so hot I might break the thermometer
Coppers they watch us and follow us
Flip through that paper no calendar
All of these jewels like I celebrate Hanukkah
I got a different kind of money
I'm on a different kind of grind
I'm with some different type of niggas
We on a different type of time
Go get the money fuck them bitches
Bitches be gettin' out of line
I turned that one into a two
I turned that point into a nine
