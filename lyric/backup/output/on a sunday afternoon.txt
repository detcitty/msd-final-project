Hi this is Huggy Boy
This is going out to all the homies on a Sunday afternoon

Sittin in the park on a Sunday afternoon
Me and the crew just jammin the oldie tune
Sippin on a cold bottle of brewsky
Gave O' a swig he passed it back to me
Right about then up came some of the homies
Mike, Elia P, J Smooth, Phil and Larry
Bustin out the ice chest Phil popped the cooler
Elia P drunk brew nothing better to do
Mike his cup yo is filled with bird
J Smooth had a cold glass to you know it word
Girls at the place juss preparing the food
The sky was clear and the weather was cool
Kids at the playground playing on the merry go round
All the cars cruisin bumpin their funky sound
Cause it's Sunday last day for a fun day
Back to business as usual come Monday
At the park everything went real smooth...
