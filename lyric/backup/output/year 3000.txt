One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise.
Went out to the back yard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys.
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor.

He told me he built a time machine.
Like one in a film I've seen
Yeah... he said...

I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water.
And your great, great, great, grand daughter
Is doing fine (doing fine).
