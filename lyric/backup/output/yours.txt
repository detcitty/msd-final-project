[Acapello:]
Bay I'm yours... if you want me.
(And if you want my sweet love)
Baby I'm yours... if you need me
(Loooove)
Lovin you forever if you want me
(give me your love)
Baby I'm yours if you need me.

[Verse 1:]
Understand girl that my heart is in your hands.
And I'm cautious. Of falling in love again.
So please don't hurt me, I'm scared.
Don't desert me, I'm afraid.
Of being a fool. Again.

[Chorus:]
