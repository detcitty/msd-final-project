She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
(Que lo que mami)

I like you talking dirty
I like your filthy love
You like the way I hold you
When we are falling in love (yo sé que sí)
In love (mami, yo sé que sí)
If it's love, then I don't want to come back up

Girl, I know you're a handful
'Cause you know what you like
You might be hard to handle
But I'mma show you tonight (pero qué rica estás)
Tonight (qué rica estás)
What it's like (what it's like)
When you're

Stuck on a feeling
Just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up
Gotta work me out, make it real
Gotta make it count

Get stuck on a feeling
Ya just can't stop, once ain't enough
Better lock this down, better box it up
