(there won't be no rock 'n' roll)
(c.w. mccall, bill fries, chip davis)

Well, it's only gonna be about an hour, friend
'til they dam your favorite river
So you can water-ski just one more reservior
And them supersonic ships are gonna take you
'cross a sea of pavement
To one more faceless brickyard on the shore

Yeah, it's only gonna be about an hour or so
'til they rip off all your mountains, boy
And that one last tired old eagle bites the sand
And all of that high-and-mighty scenery's
Gonna be leveled to the ground, boy
By a bunch a' them mindless strip mines on the land

[chorus]
So listen well, my brothers
When you hear the night wind sigh
And you see the wild goose flying
Through the gray, polluted sky
There won't be no country music
There won't be no rock 'n' roll
'cause when they take away our country
