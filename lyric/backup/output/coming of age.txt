Dressed to kill and lookin' dynomite,
with her high-laced stockings and her sweater so tight.
I asked her her name, she said her name was "Maybe."

Well she walked up to me, and she asked me to chance
I said, "I am lookin' for some wild romance,"
She gave me a wink--she said I should think about it, maybe

She said, "What you got babe, is what I need.
Your kind of love got me on my knees."
