"Piggy Bank"

Clickity clank clickity clank
The money goes into my piggy bank

I'll get atcha, my knife cuts ya skin
I'll get atcha, blow shots at ya man
I'll get atcha, Tupac don't pretend
I'll get atcha, I'll put that to an end

That shit is oh, don't be screamin' get at me dawg
Have you runnin' for ya life when I match ya boy
I get to wavin' that semi, like its legal
A lil nigga hurt his arm lettin' off that eagle
You know me, black on black bentley, big ol' black nine
I'll clap your monkey ass, get black on black crime
Big ol' chrome rims, clean you know why I shine
C'mon man, you know how I shine
I'm in the hood, in the drop, Teflon vinyl top
Got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, why I don't hear no shots
That fat nigga thought Lean Back was "In Da Club"
My shit sold 11 mill, his shit was a dud
Jada don't fuck with me if you wanna eat
Cause I'll do your lil ass like Jay did Mobb Deep
