Young girl looking to take a ride
Gonna get to love you
If it takes all night
Oh, yeah, next to you
She`s got what I want
I got what she needs
Me and my baby
And the mirror makes three
Heaven in the backseat
Heaven in the backseat
(Backseat, baby)
You can`t turn it down
You won`t turn me round
(You won`t do it)
I know you like it
I love what I see
I got your number
Your number is me
Oh, baby, start me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
I`ll drive you crazy
With my backseat love
Come on, fire me up
(Heaven in the backseat)
You`ll be in Heaven
In my backseat, baby
(Come on, start me up)
Come on, start me up
