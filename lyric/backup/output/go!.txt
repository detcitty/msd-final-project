Go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three
(Go)
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Uh, on the count of three
Everybody run back to your fantasy, now

Go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three
(Go)
Go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three

Go, go, go, go, go, go
And on the count of three
Everybody run back to your fantasy, now

(Go)
She was a bad, uh, the type at the club niggaz would grab her
(Go)
Fantasized when I had her, in the bathroom sweatin' with her ass up
(Go)
The body of a dancer, we had chemistry 'cuz she was a cancer
Thought forever it would last for, but forever move faster, so I had to

(Go)
Still I gotta pause when I think about her in dem draws
(Go)
