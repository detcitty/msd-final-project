He might be doing you
But he's thinking about me
So baby, think about another lover
And go find another brother

I know he's my man
He's all in my hands
It feels good when he calls my name
Don't you wish you had the same?

Feeling discussed, working your stuff
'Til he thinks about mine
Now he's feeling real high
You ask why 'cuz he's mine

Tell you something
That just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man
Who don't love you

I wouldn't waste my time
Telling something wrong
You've been with him one night
And now he's coming home

He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time
(You can't sleep at night)
