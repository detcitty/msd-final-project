Boy I see ya, looking at me
I feel you eyes on me, like you gotta have me
Watching every move, like it's for you
You can't help it, you're attracted like a magnet
My love ain't easy
You gon' have to put in some work
You can't buy me a drink,
thinking I'mma fall for your flirt
You gotta make it right
If you wanna go spend some time
You gotta raise the bar tonight

Love me, baby treat me right
Make it eternity and not only one night
If you love me till the end of time
