La la la la la la
Oh, la la la la la

The sounds of your voice in the night
They keep haunting me
The sounds of your voice late at night
They won't let me be

In the still, did I hear a sound
A whisper like a ghost in my heart
It's so quiet, no one's around
I won't sleep tonight
I won't even start

It's so complicated these days
