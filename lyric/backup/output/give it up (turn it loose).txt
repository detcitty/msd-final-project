You better turn it loose
You better turn it loose

I went downtown the other day
And I heard a woman say
I do all I can for that man
At home, he still won't stay

I could tell the way
That woman spoke
Her heart was truly broke

She said, if a man
Can't treat his woman right
Give her good loving day and night
He sure oughta

(CHORUS)
Give it up, turn it loose
(Turn it up loose)
