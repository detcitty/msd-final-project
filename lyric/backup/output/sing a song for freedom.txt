Everybody's gotta get a job together
Take it back all the way

Don't' think about tomorrow
Just think about today
Before dawn, understand
In this world, everybody's free
Forget about your troubles and worries
And take a good look at me

Sing a song for children
Sing a song for me
Sing a song for freedom
Sing a song for me
