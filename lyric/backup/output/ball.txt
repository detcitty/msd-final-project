Okay we walk off in this bitch
Ballin' in this bitch
Hoppin' out of Lambos and Ferraris in this bitch
Poppin' bottles with a thick red super model bitch
They may talk a lot of that but they can't do alot of this
Ay, Rico told me turn the lights on
So I grab the Audemar and threw the ice on
I'm a big dawg, got em pissed off
A lot of niggas rapping, ain't none this raw
They like, eh look at T.I., ballin' in the V.I.
Bunch of bad bitches with a look-alike Aaliyah
We just pull up, hop out
Go in, show out
Buy the whole bar, pop bottles go hard

This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt

Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball
Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball
Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball

I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt

The club full of bad bitches and they came to play
Okay it must be your eye cause it ain't your face
Now if you looking for them bottles and them stacks girl
