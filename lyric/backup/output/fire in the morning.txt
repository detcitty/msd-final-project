I know it's late to call
I don't blame you if you're angry
But these are things that only
Old lovers understand

I remember rainy nights like this when
We'd go to bed real early
And try to catch each other's dreams
And wake up holding hands

We'd light a fire in the morning and
Keep it burning strong
Outside it could be storming
But we never felt so warm
