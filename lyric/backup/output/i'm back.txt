*+•• "I never let you down I'mma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright?
Hard, I'mma ball on them squares, I flow
Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go

I know in the lead it may seem he might be
But no matter what they doing they don't do it like me
Like a G, I hold it down for the town I'm at
In a flash like that, recognize I'm back

Strike a match, catch a fire, any moment I decide
That's enough of all your lies, boy, your buzz just died
Step aside, super fly, to the shoes 'n' 8 coupe
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do

My desire to retire grow with every new crew
'Cause these guys just don't ride like my nigga, you too
Tight jeans, funny haircuts, dancing on the screen
There's a crowd of real niggas in the game so it seems

Just pretend to holla pimpin', give the shit a black eye
Next he say he trapping in my head I'm like why?
Be yourself, you ain't gotta pimp bone in your body
I can tell ya ain't never bought a key or caught a body
