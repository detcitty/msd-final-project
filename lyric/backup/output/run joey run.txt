(Chorus- woman's voice)

Daddy please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see

Every night, the same old dream
I hate to close my eyes
I can't erase the memory
The sound of Julie's cry

She called me up, late that night
She said, "Joe, don't come over,
