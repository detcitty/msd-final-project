Ohh, I been hurtin' lately
I'm down on all my luck
Sometimes there's no one there by your side
I don't deserve this baby
But I know that I can't give up
Tough times I just take them in stride

Hmmm, I'm almost there, only one more step
(Left, right, left, right, left)
I'm moving on, I got no regrets
(Left, right, left, right, left)
