You got the key
My private number
Exclusively, there's no other half
For me

You're the combination
The secret word that unlocked my door
Remedy to ease the pain
You're every thing that I've been wishing for

You keep the smile on my face
My heart's in overdrive
But when did I last try to get inside
I've got nothing to say

And that's the wasted time
Just idle talking
May you never do mistakes
Love
