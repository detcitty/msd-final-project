Papa don`t take no mess
Papa don`t take no mess
Papa is the man who can understand
How a man has to do
Whatever he can

Papa don`t, Papa don`t, Papa don`t
Papa don`t take no mess, no
He don`t take no mess

Now Papa might grin
Drink a little taste of gin
Bet his last ten on
A little game of skins, hit me

Papa don`t take no mess
Papa don`t take no mess
