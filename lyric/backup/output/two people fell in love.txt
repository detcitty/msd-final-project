A baby's born in the middle of the night
In the local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him until he cries
He goes home the next afternoon
Before you know it, he's off to school
And then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Phd. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins the Noble prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
Is all because two people fell in love

Right now at a picnic shelter
