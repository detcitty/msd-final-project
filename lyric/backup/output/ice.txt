You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
Baby your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot

Pull up, she been purring like a kitten
Preyin' your love
I've been counting on the days you been gone
A little too long, patient
Knowing exactly what it is
It lasts, time, and now
When you, come and lay between at this time
Take the ice cube (boy you know what)
Sit it right below my nable
And watch what I do
And that's my favorite angle
My legs are numb now
Your loving be giving me chills

You're like ice
