Advice for the young at heart
Soon we will be older
When we gonna make it work?

Too many people living in a secret world
While they play mothers and fathers
We play little boys and girls
When we gonna make it work?

I could be happy
I could be quite naive
It's only me and my shadows
Happy in our make believe
Soon...

And with the hounds at bay
I'll call your bluff
hey...
