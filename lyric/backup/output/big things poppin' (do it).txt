Hey, hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it
Whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, cuz I'ma do it, cuz I'ma do it
Whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it

Hey, hey, hey, big things poppin' and little things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and little things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and little things stoppin'
Ball on these suckas, shawty losin’s not an option

Now do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, cuz I'ma do it, cuz I'ma do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it

Now let me hear ya say big things poppin' and little things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and little things stoppin'
Big things poppin' and little things stoppin'
Ball on these suckas, shawty losin’s not an option

Now do it to the maximum, take it while you askin' 'em
Don't listen to them suckas when they say you too irrational
I said I was "King" and them lames started laughin' and
Same suckas now want the King on a track with 'em

I composed several classicals, you know like "Top Back"
"Dope Boy", "Bring 'Em Out", and "What You Know About That"
Now they ask how I talk, what you know about that?
Dominated '06, now I'm goin' right back, do it

See me rain hell, I just showed you like that
Even Denzel say, "Damn, I ain't know it like that"
