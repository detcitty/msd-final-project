The sea it swells like a sore head
and the night it is aching
Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed
and the day it is breaking

On rainy days we'd go swimming out
on rainy days swimming in the sound
On rainy days we'd go swimming out

You're in my mind all of the time
I know that's not enough
If the sky can crack
there must be some way back
for love and only love.
