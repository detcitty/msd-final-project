Man, fuck these niggas
I-I'ma spare everything but these niggas
I flip the gun and gun butt these niggas
Take the knife off tha AK and gut these niggas

Yeah, and fuck these bitches
I swear I care about everything b-but these bitches
I-I don't care, I, so what? These bitches
And I put Young Mula baby way above these bitches

Ha, if it ain't broke, don't break it
A-and if he ain't shook, I'm gon' shake him
Hope I don't look weak 'cause when a wolf cry wolf
You still see that wolf teeth, muthafucka

F-futuristic handgun
If you act foul, you get two shots and one
I'm at your face like man cum
You niggas softer then Rosanne's son
Y-y-you cannot reach me on my Samsung

I'm busy fucking the world and givin' the universe my damn tongue
Crazy muthafucka, I am one, b-but the crazy thing is I began one
A-all white bricks I'm straight like it's jumpin' back to thirty-six nigga
Big house, long hallways, got ten bathrooms, I can shit all day, nigga

And we don't want no problems
Okay, you're a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, Big Kane on the beat, I fuck around
And leave a nigga's brains on the street, ooh

Now pop that pussy I bring her to my bedroom
And pop that pussy, uh, huh and we be steady mobbin'
Oh, Kimosabe, big ballin' is my hobby
