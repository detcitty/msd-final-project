I'm like baby how you doin'? ayy
I'm tryna roll with you, ayy, ayy
Bust a couple moves, ayy, ayy
See how well you move, ayy, ayy
I'll teach you how to jugg with me, ayy
I'll teach you how to jugg with me, ayy
I'll teach you how to jugg baby
I'll teach you how to jugg with me

I could teach you how to jugg, baby, ayy
Zoovie, I'm the plug, baby
You ain't fuckin' with no scrub, baby, ayy
I be throwin' hella dubs baby, ayy
Throwin' fifties for the love, baby, ayy
