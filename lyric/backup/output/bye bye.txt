This is for my people who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We won't ever say bye (no no no)
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends, and cousins
This is for my people who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky
Cause we won't ever say bye

As a child, there were them times
I didn't get it, but you kept me alive
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings, and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things separation brings

You never let me know it, you never let it show

Because you loved me, and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today, face to face
Never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on I
Wish I could talk to you for awhile

Miss you but I try not to cry
As time goes by
