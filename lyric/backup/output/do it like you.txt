Oh!

Hey
There she go
That's the one I've got to know
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie right?
Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you.

It seems like for a while I've know ya
Nostalgic moments feels like magic don't it
Girl you killin ‘em, my condolence
That's how you on it? Yea that's how you on it

And I'm gonna be with you no matter what it takes
Running with scissors in the traffic, tryna cut straight to the chase
Wanna be there when you wake
With no make up on your face
Not even gloss, before you brush
Love your dimples when you blush

It's the simple things in life we take for granted cause we rush
I just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine
What's yo sign? I'm an Aries, I'm a 90′s baby clearly
I'll make sure to make some time for you though my schedule may vary

Hold up, hold up, hold up
