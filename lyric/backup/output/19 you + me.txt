It was our first week, at Myrtle beach
Where it all began
It was a 102, nothin' to do

Man it was hot, so we jumped in
We were summertime sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet

How could I forget?
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful

I was playin' everything but cool
