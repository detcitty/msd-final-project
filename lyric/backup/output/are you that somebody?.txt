East coast feel me (feel us)
West coast feel me (say what)
Dirty south (uh here we go)

East coast feel me (say what)
West coast feel me (uh-huh)
Dirty south (dirty dirty)

East coast feel me

West coast feel me (ha)
Boy
I've been watching you
Like a hawk in a sky
That flies, and
You were my prey (my prey)
Boy, I promise you
If we keep bumpin' heads

And you know that one of these days (days)
We gone it up
Probably talk from the phone
But see I don't know if that's good
I've been holding back
This secret from you
Probably shouldn't tell you but if I
If I let you know

You can't tell nobody
I'm talking bout nobody
