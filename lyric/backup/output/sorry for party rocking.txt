Sorry for party rocking...

I'll be up in the party, looking for a hottie to bone
I gotta drink in my hand, and it just called buffalo
Popping bottles in the house with models in the V.I.P
All the girls make out for the whole damn club to see
Let's go!

People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking!
Neighbors complain saying turn it down
Sorry for party rocking!
Haters don't like, we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking!
When they talk shit, we just be like
Sorry for party rocking!
