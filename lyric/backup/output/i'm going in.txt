Hello mothafucka, hey hi how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby come to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even tripping

I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard

I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard
And I'mma go hard

First off
You know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
