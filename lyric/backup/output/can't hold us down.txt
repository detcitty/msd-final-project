Hmm
Hmm
Say
What am I not supposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back
Suddenly the target don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world
(around the world)
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth, ohh
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
Ohh
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Whoaa
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down

Never can, never will...

So
What am I not supposed to say what I'm saying?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
