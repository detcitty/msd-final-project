Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You don't have to go oh-oh-oh oh
You don't have to go oh-oh-oh oh
You don't have to go

I I I I I I
All those tears I cry I I I I
All those tears I cry oh-oh I I
Baby please don't go

When I read the letter you wrote me made me mad mad mad
When I read the words that it told me made me sad sad sad
But I still love you so
