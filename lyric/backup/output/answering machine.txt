A little while ago I went and placed a call
To tell this girl I know that she could have it all
The wedding ring, the whole dumb thing
I was willing to tie the knot
So i called her up, and this is the answer I got...

*Chorus*
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in, and listen, I'm sure you know this whole routine
Leave your name and number
And I'll try and get back to you
You have thirty seconds to talk to me before you're threw
