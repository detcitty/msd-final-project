Some time ago I told you goodbye I don't know why
This crazy feeling has driven me mad I made you cry
I was such a fool to see you go
I know our love was kind and true
Baby I can trust this feeling in me now

Some time ago the love we shared seemed everlasting
I never had the chance to think this paradise would end
I was such a fool to see you go
I know our love was oh so true
Now I think this feeling's back in me now
