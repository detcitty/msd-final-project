If you've ever been on television more than 5 times 
describing what the tornadoes sounded like...
You might be a redneck.
If you've ever cut your grass and found a car...
you might be a redneck.
If your dad walks you to school because your in the same grade...
you might be a redneck.
If you've ever been too drunk to fish...

If somebody asks to see your ID and you show them your belt buckle.
