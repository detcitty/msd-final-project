Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart
One more time? Oh, no no

Did you think I'd still care
That there'd be more feeling there?
Did you think you could walk back
In my life? Oh

So you found you missed the love you threw away
Baby, but you found it out too late, too late
