In Babylon on the boulevard of broken dreams, my will power at the lowest ebb.
Oh what can I do?
Oh buccaneer!
Can ya help me put my truck in gear?
Can ya take me far away from here, save my soul from sin?

"You wanna get away? You've had it man? Nothing's going right so come sit on the sands of the island! Island of lost souls. No luxuries. No no! Amenities? Too dull! Your senses? Oh oh! Only primitive! Hey hey! Really get away!" is what he said...

Where did he go?
