The way that you walkin, the way that you talkin
You're the one I want to spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out til the morning
I can already tell you want it
Cause you shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin dat body on me
Keep on shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin dat body on me

Hey how you doin mama
I need to know ur name
You givin me the eye eye
I'm givin you the same
It just hit me right now
What we should do today
Go tell you friends bye bye
And lets go hop a plane
It's no mistaken the attractions ironic
I wanna make you someone more then just a a bon in my closet
I wanna win that type of relationship
Where you wanna come hang when your man is trippin
You say your short this month and your late on your rent
He took your car watchin me hold this
Hey hey you see oohhh
