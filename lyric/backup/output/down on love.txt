Some people stay all alone and hide
They don't even want to know the reason why
They've given up on finding someone new
But new love comes, it's gonna come for you
When true love comes, it's gonna comfort you

Now you say you've got a broken heart
You oughta know this side of love can leave you torn apart
Dry your eyes 'cause your heart's gonna mend
And maybe tonight you'll fall in love again
Yeah, maybe tonight you'l fall in love again

But I know, I know that you're down on love
