Come on girl!
Hey pretty baby with the high heels on!
You give me fever
like I've never, forever known!

You're just a product of loveliness!
I like the groove of your walk,
your talk, your dress!
I feel your fever
from miles around!
I'll pick you up in my car
and we'll paint the town!
Just kiss me baby
and tell me twice,
that you're the one for me!
The way you make me feel!
(The way you make me feel!)

You really turn me on!

(You really turn me on!)
You knock me off of my feet!
(You knock me off of my feet!)
My lonely days are gone!
(My lonely days are gone!)
I like this feelin' you're givin' me!

Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy!
Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five

to buy you things to keep you by my side!
I never felt so in love before,
just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore!
