You wake up, it's raining and it's monday
Looks like one of those rough days
Time's up, you're late again, so get out the door
Sometimes you feel like running
Find a whole new life and jump in
Let go, get up and hit the dance floor
But when the lights go down it's the ending of the show
And you're feeling like you got nowhere to go
Don't you know

You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, yeah your can change your jeans
