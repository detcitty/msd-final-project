See baby, you're my little secret
(Secret, secret)
If you don't tell, I won't tell
And that's how we gotta keep it

See baby, you're my little secret
(Secret, secret)
If you don't tell, I won't tell
And that's how we gotta keep it

Did anybody see ya coming to my house last night?
When I got your message in my beeper
That you wanna do everything I like
Alright, alright

I like being in the same room with you and your girlfriend
The fact that she don't know
That really turns me on
She'll never guess in a million years
That we've got this thing going on

You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
It's on everybody's mind, about you and I
They think so, but they don't really know
Or wanna know that

You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
