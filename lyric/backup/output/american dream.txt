Mmm...

We broke down trying to leave town
Driving down the road to change
We were born to run, Cali here we come
Escape from nowhere USA

Say goodbye to white picket fences
Say hello to palm trees and Benzes
They say you have to fall to have it all

(Mmm...)

Yeah, well we don't want two kids and a wife
