It has begun again, my friend
In this room, we are nothing but strangers in a bed
You made me fall again, my friend
How can I forget when you said love was just pretend?

Well I told her I've been thinkin' 'bout her lately
But she told me that to love her is so crazy

'Cause she loves to lay
I learned the hard way
She loves to lay, I'm all to blame
I learned the hard way
