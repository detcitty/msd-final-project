You got your hair down
I got this top back
kissing on my neck
girl you gotta stop that

Do you want that fast lane
Or do you want that back seat
Girl you gotta pick one
You cant expect me
to keep my hands to myself

She aint into Wine and Dinin
She's shooting whiskey singing sweet child of mine
Ridin 95 sitting shot gun pretty
turning this town into paradise city
