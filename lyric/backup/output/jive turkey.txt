Hey is that your o'l lady over there? 
No man! That ain't none of my o'l lady.
I used to talk to her, that guy she go out now.
And he just busted her. Now listen to this!

I used to think that you we're really cool
I used to think that you never be anybody's fool
Let me tell you baby your the jive turkey
