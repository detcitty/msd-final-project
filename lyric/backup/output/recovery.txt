First I'll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right

Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
This time I'll do you right
Woooooooah woah, wooooooooaaah

Missin' your good intentions
Missin' you from a distance
Hope you did the same

I know that I caused a problem
Know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away

Learned it don't pay to lie
