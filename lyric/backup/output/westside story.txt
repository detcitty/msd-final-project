Crip niggas, Blood niggas, ese's, Asians
Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, white boys, Jamaicans
Latin Kings, Disciples, Vice Lords, Haitians
All these motherfuckers been patiently waitin'
Since the West coast fell off, the streets been watchin'
The West coast never fell off, I was asleep in Compton
Aftermath been here, the beats been knockin'
Nate Dogg doin' his thing, DPG still poppin'
I got California Love, fuckin' bitches to that 'Pac shit
And Westside Connection, been had it locked bitch
I'm in the rearview, my guns is cockin'
I put red dots on that nigga head like Rodman
All Stars, fat laces, gun charge, court cases
Fought that, not guilty, I'm back, niggas hate me
Been there, done that, sold crack, got jacked
Got shot, came back, jumped on Dre's back
Payback, homey I'm bringin' C.A. back
And I don't do button up shirts or drive Maybachs
All you old record labels tryin' to advance
Aftermath bitch, take it like a muh'fuckin' man

If you take a look in my eyes
You see I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
