Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Reflections will show
This connection we can lean on each other
This is all we need to know

An' I admit I've been a fool sometimes
I believe, I may be losin' you
It's now or never, we talk before a tear is shed
Under your spell and over my head
You took me in your arms and you told me
"We don't need to worry, but you
You never say you're sorry"

Keep this love alive, for us, it's all I feel
How can we survive if we change what is real

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
(I weep)
