Wild Cowboys and you know this
Lookin at a Cowboy and you know they're dead

A lot of niggaz stepped up to the bad man
Chest bucked out with your head wide open
Hopin to spot a chip in this frame
I lived and died by the burnin flame
of the OK Corral Cowboy style
From the Quarters on down to Colorado's
Big niggaz from uptown ridin into Tahoe's
Saloon settin kids is walkin round
drinkin whiskey and scotch, strictly out of shotglasses
Lookin screwfaced at the next nigga who passes
There's women in garter belts and ciggarettes
And on the side there's the price game
Niggaz is playin the price game
Indian Red, was bangin niggaz in the head
With his man Apache Joe, they take your money off the floor
They side-bettin for a better, they makin cheddar
That tribal shit is work ya sound the wompom drums
Cause my Indian man'sll break your great dick, UHH
Walk in the New York terrority
On the back of a tree, there's a picture of me
It says I'm lawless, flawless, a hustler plus gun rustler
Wanted in Carolina, for sellin some of New York's finer
Marshal Cooper say he want me, Marshal Cooper gotta get me
