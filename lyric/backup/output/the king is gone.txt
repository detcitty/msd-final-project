I was barely six years old when I first heard him sing
But somehow I knew, from that moment on... 
That it would be a lifetime thing
And I'd stand in front of a mirror... 
Day and night
And I'd listen to every one of his records
And I'd repeat every word... 
And every note... 
... till, somehow, I finally got it right... 

And I was determined... 
I'd wait for the day... 
That I could stand and sing in front of an audience
And maybe someoned come up to ME and say... 
Yknow, you sound just like Elvis... 

There was man
Who gave the world his song
And the world stood still
To hear him sing...
