Yeah Yeah
She a very freaky girl
Don't bring her to mama
First you get her name
The you get her number
Then you get some pussy in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some pussy in the front seat of the Hummer

Let me set the record straight
Hater you participate
Three girls with me like I'm going on Elimidate
Say you got a man but your man ain't here
The ice in my ear shine like a chandelier
Jumping out the phantom, don't you think I'm handsome?
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Betcha baby-daddy ain't icing like the kid be
Gotcha baby-momma front seat of the Ferrari
