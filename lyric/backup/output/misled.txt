Late at night, body's yearning
Restless night, want to be with you
Someone's playing in the garden
So enticing, should I take a bite
I don't know what's come over me, yeah

She's as heavy as a Chevy
Pure excitement, misled
When she touches, can't resist her
I'm a puppet when she's playing
She's outgoing but I love her so
Misled

So I'm saying now

Baby baby, what's your claim to fame
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name
What's this crazy place you want to take me to
Tell me, what's the price if I go with you

My heart, my soul, my love
