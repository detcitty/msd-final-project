(Qur'an)
As I flip it again, I'm on the loose
Watch me, nah man, hold up, no...
As I flip it again, we're on the loose
Watch us set the trend for the 9 double deuce
Check it, to the boogie the up jumps the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogity beat
Cause I Freakit like this like my homeboys Das
"It Ain't Hard to Tell" like my main man Nas
Like Naughty, watch me give a hip-hop hooray
Much props to Dre drinking Tanqueray
I could Chieg Rock ya like the Lords
Or like Tribe, go on an Award Tour
Too Slick like Rick, watch Da Youngstas bump
Cause this is how we're coming like the future of the funk
Respect out Cube kicking it Really Doe
And Snoop Doggy Dogg and the whole Death Row
Gangstarr, Sumpreme C, and Cypress
