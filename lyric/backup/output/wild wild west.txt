Wild Wild West
Jim West, desperado, rough rider
No you don't want nada

None of this, six gunnin' this, brotha runnin' this
Buffalo soldier, look it's like I told ya
Any damsel that's in distress
Be out of that dress when she meet Jim West

Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step with flex and get a hole in your side
Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react
You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at

With Artemus from the start of this
Runnin' the game, James West tamin' the west
So remember the name
Now who ya gonna call?

Not the G.B.'s
Now who you gonna call?
"G double E G"

If you have a riff with people wanna bust
Break out before you get bum rushed at the

(Wild Wild West)
When I roll into the
(Wild Wild West)
When I stroll into the

(Wild Wild West)
When I bounce into the
(Wild Wild West)
Sisqo, Sisqo

We going straight to the Wild Wild West
We going straight to the Wild Wild West

Now, now, now, now once upon a time in the west
Mad man lost his damn mind in the west
Loveless, givin' up a dime, nothin' less
Now I must put his behind to the test
