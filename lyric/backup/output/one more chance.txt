Feel like a fool
Not realizing all the value you had
I took a happy ending and made it sad
The day I walked away and left you alone
with hardly an explanation
You stood on your own
And handled the situation
And showed to me
How understanding you could be

Now I'm alone
Looking back at all the years that we shared
Thinking of the pain you should have been spared
Afraid to ask forgiveness
But where can I go
There's no one else to turn to
