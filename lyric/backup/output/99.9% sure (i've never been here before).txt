You don't know what you do to me
You changed around the scenery
And now everything is new to me
But it looks just right, yeah, it looks just right

Whoa, it's strange but it's beautiful
Yeah, and I know where I am

Oh, I've never been here before
I've never been loved like this
Never been tumblin', stumblin' over the words
That get tangled inside of me

I've never been moved this way
Nobody's ever made me say
I'm 99.9% sure
I've never been here before

I'm walkin' in a wonderland
