One month ago today
I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park

And have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know, tomorrow is their future
But to me just another day

They all gather around me
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain

Well, I know I can't hide from a memory
'Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her?
