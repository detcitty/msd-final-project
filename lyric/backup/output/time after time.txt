Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind

Suitcase of memories
Time after sometimes you picture me
I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said

Then you say, "go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
