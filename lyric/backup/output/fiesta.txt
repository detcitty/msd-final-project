After the show it's the after party
Then after the party it's the hotel lobby
And after the Belve' then it's probably Cris'
And after the original it's probably this
(Fiesta)
Yes ma, Bed-Stuy, Fiesta

Remix with the homie from the Midwest side
Game recognize game, hoes do too
It's the new 2 Live Crew, I suppose you knew
So thugs, pop yo' toasters but don't approach us or
Bullets'll chase you like Moet mimosas

Catch us both coasts, racin' twin Porsches
Boxes with glocks that'll pop ya to make ya ghost-es
Whoever come closest you've been warned
But niggaz don't get the picture till the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on
And we'll be drinkin' till six in the mornin'

In the back of the club with ma, ma
Poppin' bottles of Cris with ma, ma
Put the bar on the tab for ma, ma
Throwin' hundreds up for grabs for ma, ma
'Cause it's about to go down tonight

I'ma be drinkin' till the early liz-ight
(That's right)
Nigga high like a muh'fuckin' ki-zite
Take three honies just to make me feel ri-zight
My, my, my, my
It's what they all say when they see the frozen ice
They say, my, my, my, my
