I was just out of the service
Thumbin' through the classifieds
When an ad that said "Old Chevy"
Somehow caught my eye
The lady didn't know the year
Or even if it ran
But I had that thousand dollars in my hand
It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
With thirty years of dust and dirt on that green army tarp
And when I pulled the cover off
It took away my breath
What she called a Chevy
Was a sixty-six Corvette
And I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills
But what a thrill I got
When I sat behind the wheel
I opened up the glovebox
