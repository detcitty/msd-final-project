Hey.
Well you work and you slave and you spend all day in your thankless job.
Then you jump in your Ford.
Door to Door.
With a hombound mob.
Then you pull in the drive and you hit the chair.
And the one you love is waitin' there.

Hey, That's what it's all about.
Hey, this is the life i couldn't live without.
It's a moment frozen there in time.
