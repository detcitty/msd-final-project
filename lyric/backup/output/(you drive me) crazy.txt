Baby, I'm so into you
You've got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
