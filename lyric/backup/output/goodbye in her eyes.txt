I could tell that it was over
When her lips met mine
It was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She had found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it
