Though it hurts to go away it's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go
I love you (I love you) you know
I'll be thinking of you in most everything I do
Now the time is moving on and I really should be gone
But you keep me hanging on for one more smile

I love you (I love you) all the while
