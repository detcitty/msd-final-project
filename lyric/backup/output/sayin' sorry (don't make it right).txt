You say that everything will work its self out
But let me tell you now what you dont know about
Its easy to turn your back on our problems
But cant you see that its no way to solve them

You can run away from me
But youll never get away from you
You can run away from me
But youll never get away from you

Sayin sorry dont make it right everytime you hurt me
Sayin sorry dont make it right
When we dont meet eye to eye everytime it hurts me
Sayin sorry dont make it right, no no

I know that mistakes are so hard to deal with
But when you reject me I always feel it
And when you choose to ignore what you dont understand
