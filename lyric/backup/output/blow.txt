Dance!
Back door cracked, we don't need a key
We get it for free
No V.I.P. sleaze

Drink that Kool-Aid
Follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're comin' with me!

It's time to kill the lights and shut the DJ down
This place about to
Tonight we're takin' over, no one's getting out

This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
This place about to blow–oh-oh-oh...
Blow-oh-oh-oh...
