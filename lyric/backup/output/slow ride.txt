Woo

Slowride, take it easy
Slowride, take it easy
Slowride, take it easy

Slowride, take it easy
I'm in the mood
The rhythm is right
Move to the music
We can roll all night

Ooh, slowride
Slowride, take it easy
Ooh
Slowride, take it easy

Slow down, go down
Got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, roll me
Slow ridin' woman, you're so fine
