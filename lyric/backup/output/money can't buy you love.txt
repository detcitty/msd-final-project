Can never buy your love, nah
You can't buy me
Never buy you love
Can't buy love
Can never buy you love, nah
Could ever buy you love
But I need new friends
I want to buy a Benz
I trip about the world
Yo, an oyster full of pearls
Rack of new clothes
Ahh-chew, Kleenex for my nose
A Rolex full of gold
Man, it makes me sold
Baby, you can't buy you love
Can't buy you love
Can't buy you happiness
Only true love can bring
Money can't buy you love
Can buy you diamond rings
But money can't buy you love
Ah, listen to me now
A burnin' desire, ah baby
You've got my heart
How much will it cost
Ooh baby, to cool it off
What do you want, all right
I'll write good checks to pay the price
My wealth I'd gladly say goodbyes
Yeah, baby
I need sneakers for my feet
Plenty of food to eat
A Rolex full of gold
Yo, anything can be sold
Money can't buy you love
