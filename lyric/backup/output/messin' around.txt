Mr. Worldwide
She's got that look in her eyes
Enrique Iglesias
Like she wants to mess around
Enrique, talk to 'em

I heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend
Who heard it from another
You been messin' around
I'm hoping that your friend, too, told you about me, too
Cause I'ma tell you straight up, I been messin' around
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
Yeah, I been messin' around

The way you lick your lips, yeah, I like that
When you act like a bad girl, I like that
That little sexy look you got, mmm, I like that
The way you whisper in my ear how you want it when you want it, girl, I like that
Let's go, baby, let's ride
Let's not talk about it, let's do it
