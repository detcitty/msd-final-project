She hit the door 6: 55
Sack full of groceries, split down the sides
Can goods scattered all the way to the curb
The look on her face saying, don't say a word
So it's me and her, and a can of beans
Sittin' there on the front porch swing
The western sky all turning red
Head on my shoulder, she sighed and said.

I've been goffering', chaufferin', company chairman
Coffee maker, copy repairman
Any more there aint nothing I swear man, that I don't do.
I've been jugglin', strugglin', closin' big deals
Dancin' backwards in high heels
