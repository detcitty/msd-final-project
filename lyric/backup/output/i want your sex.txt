There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys that you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear I won't tease you won't tell you no lies

Yeah
I don't need no bible just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby now that we're friends

Every man's got his patience and here's where mine ends

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your sex

It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go?
I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO!

I swear I won't tease you won't tell you no lies

Yeah
I don't need no bible just look in my eyes

Oooo
I've waited so long baby out in the cold
