Before you came around I asked myself
What is this thing called love?
There were clouds, the rain kept pouring down
Then you brought the sun, yes, you did

Showed me all the differences
Between a woman and a girl
Right then I knew I could be a good man
With you inside my world, my world, my world

I don't need to take a toke
'Cuz I'm on a natural high
Everybody's blowing smoke
But girl you never lie
Friends say that we in a pinch
They're just hatin' their lies
I know they want what I got
It comes once in a lifetime, yeah

You're the reason why I sing
All of life's finer things
Like rainbows and shining stars
Baby, you are
You're the reason why I sing
All of life's finer things
Like diamond rings and fancy cars
Baby, you are
