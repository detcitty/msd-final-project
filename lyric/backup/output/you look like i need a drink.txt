I could tell by the way
You sounded when you called
That I wasn't gonna like what you had to say
I could read between the lines
Somethin' different this time
Your comin' over tonight cause it couldn't wait
Now you're in the drive
I'm a wreck inside as you walk in through that door
You look like I need a drink right now
You like like you're gonna try to let me down
Nice and easy
Think I know why you won't sit down
