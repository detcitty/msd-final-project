(Yeah bow bow bow)
(Yeah yeah yeah)

End of the spring
And here she comes back
(Hi hi hi hi) (Yeah)
Those summer days those summer days

That's when I had most of my fun back
(Hi hi hi hi) (Yeah)
Those summer days those summer days
(Bow bow bow do doop)

Aww we can bum bum where we want to
(Bow bow bow do doop)
Hey we're out of school
(Bow bow bow do doop)
County fair in the country side
(Bow bow bow do doop)
And everything is cool
(Bow bow bow do doop)
