Me and my old lady
Ain't been gettin' along
Things don't get better,
I'll soon be long gone
This situation's driving me insane
Somebody fetch my coat and hat and hand me my walking cane

Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
