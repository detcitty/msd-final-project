Why do I seem to be caught up inside a dream?
All my life, it's always been my shadow and me
Over my shoulder there's always a voice somewhere
Saying, I ever should try to set my heart free

I wish that love would come and take me in her arms
Show me what I've never known
Where I could hold someone and words like right and wrong
Just fade away like yesterday

Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why, tell me why?
Won't even let me fall in love
