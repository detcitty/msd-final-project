So here we are, here all alone
The band quit playin', everyone went home
But the stars are still out and you're so damn hot
And I ain't ready for the music to stop

Baby be my love song
Baby be my all night long
Be the buzz in my Dixie cup
My steady rockin' 'til the sun comes up
You know I really love to watch you dance
Baby be my, "Oh hell yeah!"
I feel a little sing-along, sing-along comin' on
