High on the hill with the lonely goatherd
Lay odl lay odl lay he hoo
Yodel back with the girl & goatherd
Lay odl lay odl oh.
Wind It Up, Wind It Up, Wind It Up!
Odl lay odl lay odl-oo.
Yeah.
This is the key that makes us wind up
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why boys like us so much.
They like the way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape.
She's crazy, right?
They like the way we react every time we hear the...
Every time the bass bang
