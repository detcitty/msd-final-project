DJ please
Pick up your phone
I'm on the request line

Baby, baby, ba-ba baby baby
Baby, Baby, alright all night

I know it's better when the rhythm works together
With the beat in your soul
Did I ever tell you
How you make me feel
Every night you're on the control

So come on daddy won't you take it away
I know I call your line every day
I'm dialing five, five, five, zero, four, twenty-nine
So that I can hear you say, hey
