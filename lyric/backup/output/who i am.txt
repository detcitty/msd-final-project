If I live to be a hundred
and never see the seven wonders
that'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a grammy
I'm gonna be just fine
Cause I know exactly who I am

Chorus:
I am Rosemary's granddaughter
the spitting image of my father
and when the day is done
my momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
but I've got friends that love me
and they know just where I stand
