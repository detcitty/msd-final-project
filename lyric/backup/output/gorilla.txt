Ooh, I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

Look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle, you can't run
'Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killer
You'll be banging on my chest
