Who looks at her life in the palm of her hand
Rain's on the roof, there's tears in the land of heartbreak
She has made up her mind, she won't turn back again
She writes a note, but words just won't say
Turns off the TV, pulls down the shade
She's leavingâ€¦ no she won't change her mind
To leave it all behind

Just one more story from a lonely boy
A twist of fate and then a start toward home
I'm for the rainbow's end
