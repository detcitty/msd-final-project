The problem is, for many years
I've lived my life publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man
I trust, I really trust

And every time I find someone I like
Gotta worry about if it's really me
That they see
And I thought you were the one, oh

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain old Mary, Mary

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain old Mary, Mary

I don't have a lot of friends
