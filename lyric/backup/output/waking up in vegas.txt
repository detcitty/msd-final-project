You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hung-over and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID but you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks
Now don't blame me
You want to cash out
And get the hell out of town

Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
