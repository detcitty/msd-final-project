Oooh...
There I go again falling in love all over
Oooh...
The cycle never ends
You just pray you don't get burned
Oooh...
This fire inside of me, don't nobody realize
Oooh...
What u are to me, but baby u got to learn

I'm making u a coat of pink cashmere
U got to know how I feel about cha
How I always want u near

I'm making u a coat of pink cashmere
I'm counting every minute
Of every hour 'til u are here

Girl, can't u understand
