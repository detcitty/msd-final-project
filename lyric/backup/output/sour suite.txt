Don't want to listen to my telephone ring
Or sing ding-a-ling or talk about a thing
Not this morning

I don't want to think about the night before
Or maybe it's a bore behind an open door
I've got no time for that this morning

If I had the mind or I had the time
Maybe I could throw together a new kind of rhyme
And tell about my warning

But it's too late now
It's too late now
