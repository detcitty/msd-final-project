Girl, I know I don't know you.
But your pretty little eyes so blue,
are pulling me in like the moon on your skin.
I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down, get outta town.

Got the stars comin' out,
Over my hood.
And all I know now.
Is it's going good.

You got your hands up,
You're rocking in my truck.
You got the radio on,
You're singing every song.
