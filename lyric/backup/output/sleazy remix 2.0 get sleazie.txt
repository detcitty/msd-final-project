I don’t need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don’t need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

Okay I’m young and I’m tatted
I get them bucks like an addict
Rockin' this Christian Dior, I spend so much on my fabric
I got a wifey at home and what she wants she can have it
And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic
Okay now no need to panic, I’m on a beach where the sand is
Somewhere smokin’ on medication, no I won't need a bandage
Some would look at my age and try to say I’m young and I’m handsome
I say I’m filthy fucking rich, so I’m an old dirty bastard
And my cribs a disaster and my kush is the master
I was in my yellow car but my Ferrari go faster
Sounding like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Ke$ha, bout to go see the cashier
On the grind so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it
I look down and see a hundred thou’ and think its time to get it
Brought a lot of marijauna and I’m here to share it
No it’s not a problem, better get it, then I won't be here tomorrow lil' momma

I don’t need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don’t need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

I don’t need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don’t need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

We start out so cute in our baby pictures
That momma shot for our daddy so that HE wouldn’t forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he’ll remember
If not he’s human, I’m human, you human, we’ll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can’t see how momma hates him
He’s such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I’m only 8, I’m not old enough, guess it’s complicated
Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so underrated
