'Everyone feels good in the room,' she swings
'Two chord cool in the head,' she sings
'A-buzz a-buzz a-buzzing like them killer bees...'
Tell me this is not for real
Please simply this is not for real...

From time to time her eyes get wide
And she's always got them stuck on me
I'm surprised at how hot honey-colored and hungry she looks
And I have to turn away to keep from bursting
Yeah I feel that good
