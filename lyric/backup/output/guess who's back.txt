Talk to me man
This ya boy Young Hova, yo turn the muh'fuckin noise up
We'll get right into the proceedings this evening
Headphones are distortin', bring it down a lil' bit

Okay now we workin' wit it
The boy Face on the bassline, face-mob!
Welcome to New York City, it's ya boy Young Hov' chea
Kanye West on the track Chi-Town, what's goin' on now?
(Whoo!)

Can I talk to y'all for a minute? Lemme talk to y'all for a minute
Just gimme a minute of ya time baby I don't want much
(Whoo!)
Lemme talk to these muh'fuckas, uhh

Guess who's bizack?
You still smellin' crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxin' them roads
When I was huggin' it, niggaz couldn't do nuttin' wit it

Straight from the oven wit it came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth, for the shit she instilled in me
Still with me, pain plus work

Shit she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggaz can't fuck with me
