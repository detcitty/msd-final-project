I heard that life gets hard when you're older,
and the fun stuff's just for kids.
But what I realize as I grow up,
is that it's just a hit or miss.
So let's not worry 'bout to-mo-mo-mo, nah nah nah nah.
We all good, baby we alright.

How, how you doin'?
Girl tell me what it do.
I see you with your friends, but I'm tryna kick it with you.
Thought you already knew, but you didn't.
I'm tryna roll with you so I can show you how we livin'.

And I've been on a mission, tryna take you to the dance floor.
We go up right now, so to the places that they can't go.
But what's your name though?
Didn't even ask ya.
