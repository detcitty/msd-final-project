Shoo doo, shoo...

Oh, many say that I'm too young
To let you know just where I come from

Oh, but you will see that it's just a matter of time
My love will surely make you mine

Ooh, living in a world of ghetto life
Everybody around seems so uptight

Nothing's wrong
It's alright with
My man, my man

I like the kinds of ways we have our fun
His loving ways send me on and on

Yeah, hey, with my man
People out there can understand

I'm giving him something he can feel
Oh, ho, to let him know my love is real
Hey, hey, hey...
I'm giving him something he can feel
Yes, I am, babe
To let you know my love is real

So much love for us to see
So much hope for material things
Are they only in my dreams

So I wrote this song for you
To prove that real things do come true
Tell me, tell me what it means
