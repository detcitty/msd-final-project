One pound for the house, that's all we need baby
Just one for the house. c'mon

(Chorus)
Pimp juice - oooohoooooohhoooooooohhh
I think I need to let her loose (might think I need to let her loose)
Let her loose, let her loooooose
She only want me for my pimp juice (that's all she want me for f'real)
Not my pimp juice, I'm talkin her pimp juice
I think I need to cut her loose (it's time for homegirl to recognize)
Yes I do, yes I doooooo-hoooo

(Nelly)
I'm in that, seventy-four, Coupe DeVille
With the, power seats, leather, wood on my wheel
One-touch sunroof BUT leave it alone
Hoes see it can't believe it - "It's goin back on it's own"
Oooooooooooooooh, shit, that's how we do it baby
"Every day like this?" Seven dayy-ayyys
. I tell you three-sixty-five
Winter spring and fall, in the summer we ride
You actin like you never seen it befo'
