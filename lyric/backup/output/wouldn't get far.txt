[Intro: samples from "I'd Find You Anywhere"]
For you baby, I'd find you [4X]
You wouldn't get far
[The Game]
I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerrera, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brains you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cock
Picture that like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Putting oil on her likes like she Gloria Velez
She was (Eye Candy) in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she {"wouldn't get far"} cause five hundred dollars
can't get you that {"far"} how you get that {"far"}
And all these new video bitches trying to be Melissa Ford
But they don't know Melissa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards
Ha ha
[Chorus: The Game]
{"You wouldn't get far"} Fucking them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
