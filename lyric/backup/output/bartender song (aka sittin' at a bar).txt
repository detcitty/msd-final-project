Bartender I really dud it this time

Broke my parole to have a good time
When I got home it was 6 AM
The door was locked so I kicked it in
She was trippin on the bills

I think she was high on some pills
She threw my shit out into the yard
Then she called me a bum and slapped me real hard
And in my drunken stuper
I did what I should have never done

And now I'm sittin here, talking to you
Drunk and on the run
I'm sittin at a bar on the inside
Waitin for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart, in the trailer park
