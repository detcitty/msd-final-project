(Maurice White/Sheldon Reynolds/Allee Willis)

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Ooh, Sunday morning
(Ba ba by ba ba by ya)
You're gonna find my love shinin' on you
(You're gonna find my love)

Ooh, I'm waiting
I'm forever anticipating
Your face on my pillow
You're the sunshine pourin' through my window

And like the grapes on the vine
Love is sweeter with time
And you were made to love

Ooh (Sunday morning, I'll be waiting)
Sunday morning (To your love I'm dedicated)
You're gonna find my love shinin' on you
(You're gonna find my love)

Ooh (Sunday morning, I'll be waiting)
