Dance freaks move around
You know, get down
Dance freaks move around
You know, get down
It's like a freakshow, yeah, huh
Freakshow, baby, baby
On the dance floor
There's a freakshow
Freakshow, baby, baby
On the dance floor
It's just a freakshow
People, they come
From miles around
To see the freaks on
The floor throwing down
They're wearin' miniskirts
Huh, and camisoles
Tight leather pants
Or nothing at all
You'll be dancing
One on one or two on two
They're dancing three on one
'Cause there ain't no rules
Face to face
And cheek to cheek
They're dancing on the floor
For all to see
Freakshow, baby, baby
On the dance floor
There's a freakshow
When you're out on the floor
Freakshow, baby, baby
On the dance floor
It's just a freakshow
Everywhere I go, yeah
Freakshow, baby, baby
On the dance floor
There's a freakshow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Freakshow, baby, baby
On the dance floor
It's just a freakshow
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
Everybody sing, say
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa oh, whoa oh oh
People, they come
