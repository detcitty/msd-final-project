Warmer than sunshine, baby
Sweeter than tears
That's how my life has been
Since you first appeared
You opened up my heart
To everything fine
You put a light inside me
And you made me shine

From the time I met you everything came true
All I ever dreamed
I found in you

Ooh, you got it
There's no way
I'm gonna live without it
Nothin' can stop it
I'm all yours
