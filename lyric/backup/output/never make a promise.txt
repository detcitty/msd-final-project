I don't have to think about it
I've never been in love
And I only dreamed about it
I wondered what it was

But now I think I know It's clear to me
You've made me understand
I'm so proud to say I love you
I'm so proud to be your man, yes I am

I promise I'll never hurt you
I'll never make you cry
I'll promise I'll never hit you
Cross my heart and hope to die

'Cause I know I'll keep you safe
I'll keep you warm
I'll keep you satisfied
Be your sunshine in the morning
Be your everything at night

You told me what you wanted
I gave you what you need
I told ya that I love you
Make it good for you and me
And I never make a promise
That I can't keep, that ain't me

You told me what you wanted
And I gave you what you need
I told ya that I love you
Make it good for you and me
And I never make a promise
