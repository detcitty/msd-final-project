Hey stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
As we walked we were talking

I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks
At your window
I'll be the one waiting there

Even when it's cold
Hey stephen
Boy you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it
If you look like an angel
Can't help that I if I want to
Kiss you in the rain so

Come feel this magic I've been feeling Since I met you
