Yeah
Turn the mic up

I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip over myself, and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit
That makes me wanna scream

So do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
Don't stop, let's party

Do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body

Write what you want
Say what you want about me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry

Do what you want
What you want with my body
What you want with my body

You can't have my heart, and
You won't use my mind, but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
