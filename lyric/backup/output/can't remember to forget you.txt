I left a note on my bedpost
Said, "not to repeat yesterday's mistakes"
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory

The way you make me feel, yeah
You gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh, here we go
You a part of me now, you a part of me
So where you go, I follow, follow, follow

Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go

But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
