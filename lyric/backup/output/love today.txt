Everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today, gonna love today
Everybody's gonna love today, gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love, love me, love, love me, love, love

I've been crying for so long
Fighting tears just to carry on
But now, but now it's gone away

Hey girl, why can't you carry on?
Is it 'cause you're just like your mother?
A little tyke, like to tease for fun?
Well, you ain't gonna tease no other, gonna make you a lover

Everybody's gonna love today, love today, love today
Everybody's gonna love today
Anyway you want to, anyway you've got to
Love, love me, love, love me, love, love

Girl in a bluewith the big bust on, big bust on, big bust on
