Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin
Listen to me baby, relax and start passin
Expressway, hair back, weavin through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin
Clowns I spot em and I can't stop laughin
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all aint writin well, too concerned with
fashion
None of you aint Gizelle, cat walk and imagine
