I've seen you twice
in a short time
only a week since we started
it seems to me
for every time
I'm getting more openhearted

I was an impossible case
no one ever could reach me
but I think
I can see in your face
there's a lot you can teach me

so I wanna know
What's the name of the game
does it mean anything to you
what's the name of the game

can you feel it the way I do
Tell me please
'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child

beginning to grow
And you make me talk
and you make me feel
