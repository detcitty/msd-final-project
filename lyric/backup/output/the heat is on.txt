The heat is on on the street
Inside your head every beat
And the beat's so loud deep inside
The pressure's high just to stay alive
'Cause the heat is on
Woo
Oh whoa ho oh whoa ho
Caught up in the action I've been looking out for you
Oh whoa ho oh whoa ho
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
Tell me can you feel it
The heat is on

The heat is on
Heat is on
Oh it's on the street
The heat is on
Oh whoa ho oh whoa ho
