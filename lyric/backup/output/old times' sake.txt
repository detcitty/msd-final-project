Old Times' Sake
Sweet Sable
Old Time's Sake
Sweet Sable
[Chorus:]
I know a place where we could go outside and have some fun
Just you and me, together we are one on one
I know you, you remember when we use to chill back when
Smokin' the blunt and sippin' on the Heineken

Verse One:

Long time no see
