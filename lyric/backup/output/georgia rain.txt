1st Verse

Barefoot in the bed 'a your truck
On a blanket lookin' up
Half a moon peekin' down at us
From underneath the clouds
Teenage kids sneakin' out again
Heard the thunder rollin' in
We were fallin' the moment when
It all came pourin' down

1st Chorus

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
What I felt for you that day
