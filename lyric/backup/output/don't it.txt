Baby, don't say no so quick
This ain't about me trying to see how far I can get
Ain't gonna lie
Wouldn't mind a little eye to eye, lips on lips
Swayin' to the music, real close
We could both use a little let go
Kind of night, Baby if you want a good time

We could get on it
Let's Take a shot or you can sip on it
We'll find a floor that we can dance on it, Slow song it,
as far as I can tell, that finger ain't got no ring on it
So come on baby, bring on it
It's one of those stars fallin', love callin'
Get you feelin' alright nights,
Sounds good don't it, don't it
