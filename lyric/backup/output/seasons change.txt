Some dreams
Are in the night time
And some seem like yesterday
But leaves turn brown and fade
Ships sail away
You long to say a thousand words but
Seasons change

It feels
Like it's forever
No reason for emptiness
But time just runs away (time runs away)
No more day by day
You dream again and scenes remain
But seasons change

(I want you)
I want to feel you by my side
(I need you)
Don't you know I need you baby

(Seasons change)
Feelings change
It's been so long since I found you
Yet it seems like yesterday
