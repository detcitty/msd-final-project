DJ please, pick up your phone
I'm on the request line

This is a Missy Elliott one time exclusive

C'mon, c'mon
Is it worth it, let me work it
I put my thang down, flip it and reverse it
Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i
Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i
If you got a big, let me search ya
To find out how hard I gotta work ya
Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i
Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i
I'd like to get to know ya, so I can show ya
Put the pussy on ya, like I told ya
Gimme all your numbers so I can phone ya
Your girl acting stank then call me ovah
Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa
Call before you come, I need to shave my chocha
You do or you don't or you will or you won't cha

Go downtown and eat it like a vulcha
See my hips and my tips so cha

See my ass and my lips don't cha
Lost a few pounds in my waist for ya

This the kinda beat that go wa ta ta
Ra ta ta ta, ta ta ta ta ta
Sex me so good I say, "Blah blah blah"
