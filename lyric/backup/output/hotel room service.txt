DJ Tim Johnson, I want everybody to stop what they're doin' (Mr. 305)
Now if you know you're with somebody

You're gonna take the hotel room tonight, Make some noise (woo)
Meet me at the hotel room, Meet me at the hotel room
Meet me at the hotel room, Meet me at the hotel room

Forget about your boyfriend And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends And meet me at the hotel room
Forget about your boyfriend And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends And meet me at the hotel room.

We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn, We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn.
We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn, We at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn.
She like that freaky stuff, Two in the "O" and one in the eye
That kinky stuff, you nasty, But I like your type
