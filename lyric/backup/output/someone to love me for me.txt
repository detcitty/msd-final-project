Oh
End of another long show and I search for the love of a lifetime
This is the best that you gave because stars aren't allowed to get lonely
My heart screams look past my frame, I'm in need of some laughter
Oh, please let me live in your world I hope that eyes can see
That I need someone to love me for me, me
So you ask yourself oh, this feeling is it true from the heart
Was it my fame and glory why the stars in your eyes wrote the story
