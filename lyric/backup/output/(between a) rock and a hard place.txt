Welcome to this groove
And now one, two, three, four

Between a rock
Between a rock and a hard place

There's a beating heart
Watching the lights go down on my world
Stoney faced
Letting the rope slip though my fingers
Ain't nothin' straight, always a riddle
Caught up in the middle of the party line
