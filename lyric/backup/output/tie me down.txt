She ain't gonna tie me down
So why you on the road?
Buying all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes?
What you want right now? What up right now?
I think you need to close your mouth

'Cause you ain't gonna tie me down
Tie me down, tie me down
You ain't gonna tie me down
You ain't gonna tie me down

Know we been together for a minute
But uh, it's kinda been forever since I been in
The kinda situation not involving other women
And it's pretty obvious that you kinda trippin', like

"Who the hell is this bitch, lookin' a hot mess?
What, you fell for this chick?"
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it
I'm like, "You need to go somewhere else with this shit"

Because I ain't gonna put up with you
Talkin' 'bout how she make you uncomfortable
I mean, shit, I'm only 17
