So yesterday
So yesterday, so yesterday
You can change your life (If you wanna)
You can change your clothes (If you wanna)

If you change your mind
Well, that's the way it goes
But I'm gonna keep your jeans
And your old black hat ('Cause I wanna)

They look good on me
You're never gonna get them back

At least not today, not today, not today
'Cause if it's over let it go and
