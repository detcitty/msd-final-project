Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
For real
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
For real
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex
I never met anybody with, such a sexy smile
The way you wear perfurme, just drives me wild
The way your bound to get in trouble with that pretty skin
And those big brown eyes always begging me
The way you drive me crazy, even weary on the phone
I can be a thousand miles away girl, but I still get turned on
Is it cause you're sexy body, just the way you talk
I think it's all of the above, and the way you walk
