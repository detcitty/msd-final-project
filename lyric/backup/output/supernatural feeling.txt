I stay up too late,
I've got the Mark of Cain,
That's what Sam would say,
Yeah
That's what Cas would say,
Yeah

I've had way too many drinks,
Hell, I can't even sing,
At least that's what people say,
Yeah
That's what people say,
Yeah

But I keep cruising,
Black Impala moving,
It's like I got this brother,
By my side, saying "It's gonna be alright."

â€˜Cause the angels gonna play play play play play,
And the Demons gonna hate hate hate hate hate,
Baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off, Shake it off

Sam's heart is gonna break break break break break,
And I've got the Mark of Cain Cain Cain Cain Cain,
Baby I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake,
Shake it off, Shake it off

I want The Blade all the time
(Yup)
I keep telling them I'm fine,
(Nope)
And that's what they don't see,
(No)
That's what they don't see
(No)

I'm killing on my own,
(Killing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go,
(Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know,
(Know)
That's what they don't know
(Know)

But I keep cruising,
Black Impala grooving,
It's like I got this angel,
By my side, saying "It's gonna be alright."
