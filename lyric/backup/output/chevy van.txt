I gave a girl a ride in my wagon
She crawled in and took control
She was tired as her mind was draggin'
I said get some sleep and dream of rock and roll

'Cause like a picture she was laying there
Moonlight dancing off her hair
She woke up and took me by the hand
She's gonna love me in my Chevy van
And that's all right with me
