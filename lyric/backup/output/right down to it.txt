Baby, if I drive you crazy
Ain't nothin' personal about it
Girl, I'm just that way
See, baby, sometimes I'm shaky
But don't confuse, it don't cha lose it
'Cause it be that way

Oh, here lately I been thinkin', just a thinkin'
Thinkin' whatcha think of your guy
Somebody's tellin' you I don't care about you
Ain't a single word about it true
