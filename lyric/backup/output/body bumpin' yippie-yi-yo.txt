[chorus:]
Yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yea, wanna bump yo' body, baby
Wanna bump yo' body, wanna bump yo' body
Yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yea, wanna bump yo' body, baby
Wanna bump yo' body, wanna bump yo' body {Don't stop}
Yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yea, wanna bump yo' body, baby (Hmm mmm)
Wanna bump yo' body, wanna bump yo' body (I wanna bump with you)
Yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yea, wanna bump yo' body, baby
Wanna bump yo' body, wanna bump yo' body {Don't stop}

[verse 1:]
Out on the dance floor, I'm holdin' you so tight
Gotta make you feel me, gotta press your body tight
Rub against my body, grind, and I'm in the mood for the same
Dancin' real freaky (Ooh), this is how you groove
What's on your mind, it's body bumpin' time, baby
Love makin', hopefully, while we grind
Uh-huh, don't you want me 'cause I want you
Let's do this, what we're doin', yeah

[chorus:]
Yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yea, wanna bump yo' body, baby
Wanna bump yo' body, wanna bump yo' body (We can do this all night)
Yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yea, wanna bump yo' body, baby
Wanna bump yo' body, wanna bump yo' body (Bumpin' your body) {Don't stop}
Yippie-yi-yo-yippie-yi-yea, wanna bump yo' body, baby
