Now that you are here with me, baby, let's do it right
Lady, you know just what I need, I want to hold you, oh so tight
Baby, just touch me anywhere, cutie, you turn me on, ooh baby, I like
To run my fingers through your hair, so come on and stay with me all night

I wanna rock wit'cha baby, all night long
I wanna roll wit'cha lady, feelin' so strong
