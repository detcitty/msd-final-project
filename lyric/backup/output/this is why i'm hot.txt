This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, yeah
This is why, This is why
This is why I'm hot, uh
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, ooh
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot 'coz I'm fly
You ain't 'coz you're not
This is why, this is why

This is why I'm hot
I'm hot 'coz I'm fly
You ain't 'coz you're not, Mims
This is why, this is why
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
Now I've gotta rap
I can sell a mill
Say you nothing on the track
I represent New York
I got it on my back
Nigga say that we lost it
So I'm ma bring it back
I love the dirty dirty
'Coz niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce
As soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest
They love to take it slow
So when I hit the H
I watch you get it on the floor
And if you needed hyphy
I take it to the bay
Frisco to Sac town
They do it e'ryday
Coppin' a Hollywood
Soon as I hit LA
I'm in that low low
I do it the Cali way
And when I hit the Chi
People say that I'm fly
They like the way I dress
They like my attire
They love how I move crowds
From side to side
They ask me how I do it
