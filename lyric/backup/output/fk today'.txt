Sitting on my porch sippin' on Jim Beam
Read the newspaper man, guess what I seen
Shit bad enough to make a grown man scream
And then I woke up, this is not a bad dream

I don't really wanna talk about it
'Cause every time I talk about it, I go off about it
And every time I get like that I wanna start somebody
This world really got you thinking that you are somebody

So what? You got a gun, I don't give a fuck about it
I would take every bullet and every buck up out it
So motherfucker, cock it back and please buck away
'Cause right now I'm feeling "fuck you"

And fuck today, fuck today
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today

I say fuck today, fuck today
Fuck "everything gonna be alright", fuck "ok"
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today
'Cause I'm feeling like I had about enough today

Don't you see that this whole world is my stage?
And I must perform to the best of my abilities, yeah
Motherfuckers talking away, but we don't care what they say
We taking this day by day

Man, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning
And my tank on "E" plus the gas prices soaring
