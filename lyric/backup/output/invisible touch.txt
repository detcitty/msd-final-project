Well, I've been waiting,
waiting here so long,
But thinking nothing,
nothing could go wrong,
Well, now I know
She has a built-in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah,
She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart.
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah,
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.
