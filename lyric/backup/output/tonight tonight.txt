Love lost her way again
I stayed at home
Another sleepless night

Here by a telephone
That never seems to
Ring a ray of hope
Into a man so all alone

And I tried to let you go
Time after time
I lost my mind

Suddenly late last night
You finally called and
All my dreams came true today
You're coming home to stay
