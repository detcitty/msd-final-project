When I see your face
Like a mornin' sun
You spark me to shine

Tell all the world
My need is fulfilled
And that's a new design

As long as you're near
There is no fear
Of a victory, all right

But when I'm away
Influences stray
My mind to disagree

I wanna see your face
In a morning sun
Ignite my energy, ow

The cause and effect of you
Has brought new meaning
