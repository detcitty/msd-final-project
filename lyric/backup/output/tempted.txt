I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste
A flannel for my face
Pajamas, a hairbrush
New shoes and a case
I said to my reflection
Let's get out of this place

Passed the church and the steeple
The laundry on the hill
Billboards and the buildings
Memories of it still
Keep calling and calling
But forget it all, I know I will
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on
Now that you have gone

There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
