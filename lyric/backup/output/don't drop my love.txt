When your hand, I squeeze it tight
I'm putting my trust in you
If you take your time and love me right
There ain't nothing that I won't do

Take me higher and higher
Baby, let's have a ball
(Let's have a ball)
Take me higher and higher
Don't you let me fall

[CHORUS]
Don't drop my love
Don't drop my love
Baby, handle me with care
(Handle me, handle me)
