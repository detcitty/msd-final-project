I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when your in bed with her
You think of me
I would never wish bad things
But I don't wish you well
Could you tell
By the flames that burned your words

I never read your letter
'Cos I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer
Try and make it all OK

Does it hurt
To know I'll never be there
Bet it sucks
To see my face everywhere
It was you
Who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew, exactly what you would do
