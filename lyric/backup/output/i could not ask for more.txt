Lying here with you
Listening to the rain
Smiling just to see
The smile upon your face
These are the moments
I thank God that I'm alive
These are the moments
I'll remember all my life
I found all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more
Looking in your eyes
Seeing all I need
Everything you are
Is everything to me
