And you want my love
Well that's alright
Well it will be there for you morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good
And do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life

Well you wanna be loved (uh)
Hey that's O.K.
Cause it falls in line right with my sexuality
But you gotta be down
A nigger gotta be true
Cause otherwise this bitch ain't got no time for you

Oh baby, baby, baby
I got so much love in me
Ooh (baby, baby,) baby, baby, baby
Cause if your're gonna get me off
You got to love me deep
