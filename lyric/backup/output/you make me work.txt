Ow ow ow ow
ow... ow... ow... ow...
Well i've been losin' my mind
and bustin' my behind
trying to get you, girl.
and i've been working so hard
i feel like you deserve a check
and i'm made of passion, girl.
you know i'm really glad to meet you
when you're always sweeter
when you bust my drops
'cos you will work a man so hard
he'll drop down to his knees
i'm beggin' you baby baby please
You make me work all night
all night even in between
why do you make me work all night?
but you never let up it seems
Now i work a hard job
eight hours preachin' everyday
