Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some maze

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some maze

It's the people's champ
I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off
Of the old school Impala

I'm with that Big Bank Hank
That Poppi Joe and Box
Trunk bump like chicken pox
Turn the bass up just a notch

You see them blades choppin'
You see that trunk poppin'
Ho's that diss me in the club
The same ho's in the parking lot boppin'

They see me in the Jag
Acting bad with T Ferris
Open mouth and showcase ice
And you gon' see about 20 karats

I'm what they do
You on 5-9 double O
In the Tahoe on 24's
I'm the truth, I got that glow

I'm out that Swisha House
With Archie Lee and Couda Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang
The candy paint dripping off the frame

You see me acting bad
I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say cheese and show my fronts
It's more carrots than Bugs Bunny's lunch
