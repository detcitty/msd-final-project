Shawty, no joking
And I'm hoping, if I'm not slowing
Gotta just keep on rollin'

I'm joking (homeboy moving fast)
And I'm hoping (praying that I don't crash)(All I know is)
I'm not slowing
Gotta just keep on rolling
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused
Homeboy moving fast
And I'm hoping, praying I don't crash
All I know is I'm not slowing
Gotta just keep on rolling
Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused

Pulling up once, I'mma lit mine up
Fill up the plug, let me light my blunt
And I don't really know what the fucks in my cup
But a couple shots of it got a nigga unstuck
I'm just here to have a good time
A lil white chick, a lil white wine
Outta town, spent a couple nights at chows
Smoking weed in the suites, til we out of towels
