Well I tried and I tried
But the river seems so wide
And my head hurts and my hands are tied

And it's so hard
When you're standing on the yard
Every time that your number comes around

Call me up in dreamland
Radio to me man, alright
Get the message to me
Anyway you can

Well let your river roll
A way down in your soul
Never to grow old
On the saxophone

From the airport to the plane
