She comes rolling right off the tip of my tongue so easy
She'll be the first damn thing alone when I start drinking
I'm breathing her in, breathing her out, once I pick her up I can't put her down

She's smoke
I put her in nice and slow
She's a habit and I can't let go
Blowing rings around my heart
The one she stole
Watching her sway and go
It's killing me and I know
Can't stop her once you start
She's smoke
