It's just an old beat up truck,
Some say that I should trade up
Now that I got some jangle in my pocket.
But what they don't understand
Is it's the miles that make a man.
I wouldn't trade that thing in for a rocket.
What they don't know is my dad and me
We drove her out to Tennessee
She's still here and now he's gone
So I hold on.

It's just an old beat up box,
Its rusty strings across the top
It probably don't look like much to you.
But these dents and scratches in the wood,
Yeah, that's what makes it sound so good.
