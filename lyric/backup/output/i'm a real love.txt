Well, I was 18, makin' minimum wage
With a Letterman jacket and a Chevrolet
I thought I was cool, yeah
I ruled the school

You were Cum Laude with the strawberry lips
You had the whole world danglin' at your fingertips
Your senior year
An' I was your daddy's worst fear

We ran off on graduation night
Thought a couple of left hand rings
Would make everything all right

With a little bit a-live, little bit a-learn
