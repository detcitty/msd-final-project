Back in town with the biggest show around
Strike up with the band
it's time for Astral Man
Don't know where he'll be landing
from his tightrope in the sky
Don't know if he will make it.

Close your eyes
watch him fly
Astral Man
turning in relation to the ground
Burning, please remember what you see
