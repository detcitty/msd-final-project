Got this flight to London
I ain't pop no Xans for it
In case you was wonderin'
I ain't even plan for it
I just left L.A, barely caught the plane
Fuckin' TSA
Swear a nigga ran for it
Ain't used to this fame shit
This you all know my name shit
Me, I'm just the same kid
That fucked around and made it
Fucked over my main chick

Damn she was the main chick
Thinkin' 'bout the game
I shouldn't have played, but I played it

And now I'm missin' your love, I'ma roll up
I'm faded once again
I don't know where I am
But I just know I'm driftin' far from you
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart

Won't just let me grow away from you

Don't you know we're driftin' off, driftin' off?
I know you think that it's my fault for fallin' off
All this hope and disregard, driftin' off
I know you think there ain't no fault
I fall apart
And now I'm missin' your love

I blame it on the distance
