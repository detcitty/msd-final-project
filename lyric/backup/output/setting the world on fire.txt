Yeah we got drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
Taking pictures of people we thought were stars
(It's easy to give in to your heart...)
When you're drunk on La Cienega Boulevard
When the song comin' out of the speakers
Was the band that you had on your t-shirt
We were screamin' cause all the streets were empty
And you kissed me, and we were...

Up all night and we were feelin' so good
Yeah, we got a little higher than we probably should
