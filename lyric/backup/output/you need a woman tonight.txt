You need a woman, need a woman tonight
You are looking to your left, you are looking to your right
You need a woman tonight, you need a lover so right
You need a woman tonight

I got this feeling, got this feeling inside
I'm not looking to run, I'm not looking to hide
You need a woman tonight, you need a lover so right
You need a woman tonight

Oh, it's on a lonely night
When a man needs a woman to love
