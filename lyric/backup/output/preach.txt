I'm in Miami
I need to call up Miss Cassidy
My name is party not participation
Sorry for the miscommunication
I need a drink and some tequila with you
You know what I'm trying to do
Hey let's pop the E off at Liv I've got some time here to blow
I've got the money to blow
I've got the money and blow
Don't have to guess how I know
Oh its a secret just for me I'll keep it
