I hear you had a good offer down on third avenue
You tell me that was the reason for whatcha', you put me through, yeah
And now you come collapsin' back I feel the heat of your attack
Want me to take you back I'm givin' you the sack so don't waste your time

It's a little too little, it's a little too late
I'm a little too hurt and there's nothin' left that I've gotta say
You can cry to me baby but there's only so much I can take
Oh, it's a little too little it's a little too late
