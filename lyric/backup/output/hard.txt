They can say whatever, I'mma do whatever
No pain is forever (yup!), You know this
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' need to try it
I live where the sky ends (yup!), You know this
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades, blacked-out Maybach
I'mma rock this shit like fashion, as in
Going til they say stop and my
Runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here (here)
No fear (feat) and while you're getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal
I better let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard (so hard)
Yea, yea, yea, I'm so hard (so hard)
