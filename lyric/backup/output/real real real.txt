I think I know what you mean
And although it sounds obscene
I will always do my best to understand
You have so many words
And your voice is always heard
But who can say they really understand?

Real, real, real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know
How to feel real real
Do you feel real?
And if so I'd like to know

Well you say you have a big love
