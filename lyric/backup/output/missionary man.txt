Well I was born an original sinner, 
I was borne from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill for all the things I've done
There'd be a mountain of money piled up to my chin

My mother told me good, my mother told me strong
She said, "Be true to yourself and you can't go wrong
But there's just one thing that you must understand"
You can fool with your brother 
but don't mess with a missionary man"
Don't mess with a missionary man, 
don't mess with a missionary man, 
don't mess with a missionary man
