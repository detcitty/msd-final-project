Spoken: Your cash ain't nothing but trash (Take 1). Here we go. Yeah, you may have heart about the gangster of love and the space cowboy, but I'm gonna whip a cat on you right now who's had more trouble, trials and tribulations.

One, two, three, hey
Yeah
It's alright
Look here

I was walking down the main track
One night
I met a fine chick
She was built just right

She stopped when I flashed my roll
I told her she could have all of my dough

She turned around and with a frown
She said this ain't no circus
And I don't need a clown

Your cash ain't nothin' but trash
