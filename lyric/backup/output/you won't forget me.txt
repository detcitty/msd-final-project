Ooooooooo

Tonight is the night
You're gonna get the best
I'll treat you right, I'm better than the rest
Wherever you go, and wherever you will be
You won't forget me, you won't forget me
Oo-oo-oo, na-na-na-na

Your gonna miss what I got to offer
Oo-oo-oo, na-na-na-na
When you need action, love and affection
