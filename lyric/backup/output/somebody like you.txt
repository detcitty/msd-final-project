Shoulda kept my distance
Shoulda known what I be riskin
But nothin short of holding you would ever do

Darlin

If we could be together
I would wait for you forever
But how'm I gonna win
If you never lose
I could feel the pressure
I could see you were something special
I couldn't walk away from you if Id tried
