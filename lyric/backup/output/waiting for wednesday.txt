Waiting for Wednesday, my stomach doesn't hurt enough
Pain always is the sign
Waiting for Wednesday, no proof of mine exists
So l don't have to take it back

Don't want to show you good-bye
Show you good-bye
Show you good-bye
Show you good-bye

But you're waiting for Wednesday
Waiting for Wednesday
Waiting for Wednesday
I pray you'll put me on the spot
I do believe you, that you'll love me, that you'll leave me

Don't want to show you good-bye
