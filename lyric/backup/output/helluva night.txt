It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
Mustard on the beat, ho
Luda!

Rollin down the highway
Nothing for me to do but smoke, it's habitual Friday
Break it down, spread it out, nigga roll up
And let's see what they about, call them hoes up
Ludacris, man these bitches want my last name
Sippin slow but I'm drivin all in the fast lane
Get the fuck up out my way, man, move bitch
And hoodie yappin if you never wanna do shit
I'm all about it, get yo mind right
Been making money since before I was in the lime light
Grind like â€“ bitch, wussup!
Top down but I feel like getting fucked up
I get high but the bass low
A real nigga, watch a woman wanna shake fo
When you shake it for a baller better shake it right
'Cause it's about to be a hell of a night

It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
It's about to be a hell of a night
