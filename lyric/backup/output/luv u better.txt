this is hard to say, I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
cause lately I been busy a lot
and I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I use to tell you that your hair look fly
kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
now I talk real foul and slick
every other sentence is you make me sick
back in the days I was your number one pick
now your heart's half broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
cause I can't see you bouncin with somebody else
it's a long journey back to the place we was
when I was too embarassed to admit I was in love
and you was a good girl that wouldn't give it up

I can't let her self destruct, uh uh
