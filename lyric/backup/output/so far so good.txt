No way of knowin' where we're goin'
No way of tellin' what we've got
Love is attraction, calls for action, like it or not

We're no one-nighter, we're much righter
I taste tomorrow in your kiss
But I can't sell you, I won't tell you
That we can't miss, I'll just say this

So far so good, we've been movin' right along just like we should
