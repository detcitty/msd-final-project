I wanna be rich and I want lots of money
I don't care about clever, I don't care about funny
I want loads of clothes and fuck loads of diamonds
I heard people die while they're trying to find them

And I'll take my clothes off, and it will be shameless
'Cause everyone knows that's how you get famous
I'll look at The Sun, and I'll look in The Mirror
