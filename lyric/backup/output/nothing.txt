Am I better off dead, am I better off a quitter
They say I'm better off now, than I ever was with her
As they take me to my local down the street
I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet

They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
But after one too many I know that I'm never
Only they can see where this is gonna end
They all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
Cause I'm shouting your name all over town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change your mind turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred so I
Dial her number and confess to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing
(Nothing, nothing â€¦)
