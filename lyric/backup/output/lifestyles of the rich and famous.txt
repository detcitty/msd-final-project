Lifestyles of the rich and famous

always see it on t.v.
or read in a magazines
celebrities want sympathy
all they do is piss and moan
inside the rolling stone
talkin' about how hard life can be
I'd like to see them spend a week
livin' life out on the street
i don't think they would survive
if they could spend a day or two
walking in someone else's shoes
i think they'd stumble and they fall
