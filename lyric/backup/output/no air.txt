Tell me how im supposed to breathe with no air (air)
Oooh...

If i
should die
before
I wake
Its cause
you took
my breath
away
losing you is like living in a world
with no air
Ohhh...
Im here
alone
didnt want
to leave
My heart won't move

its incomplete

wish there
was a way
that i can get you to understand

But How
Do you expect me

To live alone with just me
Cause my world revolves around you
its so hard for me to breathe

Tell Me How im supposed to breathe with no air
Can't live can't breathe with no air
thats how i feel whenever you ain't there
