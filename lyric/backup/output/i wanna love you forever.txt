You set my soul at ease
Chased darkness out of view
Left your desperate spell on me
Say you feel it too
I know you do
I've got so much more to give
this can't die, I yearn to live
Pour yourself all over me

and I'll cherish every drop here on my knees
I wanna love you forever
and this is all I'm asking of you
ten thousand lifetimes together
