You do what you want to do
I'll leave it all up to you
In time, I'll fall in love again

A hot love growin' cold
Just when you thought you'd found a heart of gold
Looks like I've been fooled again

But it's alright with me now
I'll get back up somehow
And with a little luck, I'm bound to win
I'll fall in love, I'll fall in love again

And you're always sittin' ring side
Just a rollin' with the changing tide
