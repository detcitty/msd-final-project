Maybe the fact I got a flight at six
Adds to the mystique of what might exist
Lurked your Instagram tryna like your pics
I know your boyfriend, he probably might get pissed
It's one o'clock, I've drunk all of this
So that's probably why I'm all acting brash
I'm like an addict how I have to smash
I'm always leaving fast, she think I am The Flash
Cause she's never catching a man
If it don't pan out I'm a flash in a pan
Young Leonardo, try catch if you can
We just spent the night now send her back to her man
Maybe some different time our paths will cross and then we'll drink some wine
And we'll fuck and we'll kick it, smoke weed for a minute
You'll end up a verse when I think of a line
Or when I need a muse on a record just like this one
And then when she hears it, she's so amused
She think it's her but it's just fun
I mean really now, it ain't just one
