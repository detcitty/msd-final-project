Boul ma sene,
boul ma guiss madi re nga fokni mane
Khamouma li neka thi sama souf ak thi guinaw
Beugouma kouma khol oaldine yaw li neka si yaw

mo ne si man, li ne si mane moye dilene diapale
Roughneck and rudeness,
We should be using, on the ones who practice wicked charms
For the sword and the stone

Bad to the bone
Battle is not over

Even when it's won
And when a child is born into this world
It has no concept
Of the tone the skin is living in
It's not a second
