Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.

She said "Some days I feel like shit
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit,"
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long
And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up I don't have much to say
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?"

I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
