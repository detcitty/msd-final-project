Prince & The New Power Generation
Miscellaneous
Morning Papers
He realized that she was new 2 love
Naive in every way
Every schoolboy's fantasy she was
That's why he had 2 wait
If he poured his heart into a glass and offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time 4 the morning papers

They could take a walk down the ocean side
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel and ride
Or kiss in every cave
