What do you say, girl
We do something crazy?
Quit putting it off
You know what I'm sayin'

Ain't like it ain't gonna happen, forever's a given
It's already written, who we kiddin', baby, come on
The stars can't line up any straighter
Let's do it now and think about it later

Why wait another minute
For something we should've done yesterday
I know a little church
With a preacher who could hook us up right away
