Yeah, come on, here it is y'all
One more time, JD, MH
Yeah, 'So So Def' is in the building

MH and Pi-Pi-Pied Piper
MH and Pi-Pi-Pied Piper
We get the girls so so hyper
We make em' say da da da

Rolled up to the party in a black Lex jeep
Hop out the whip, I'm feelin' freaky
All of the ladies come surround me
'Cuz I'm so important like the H.N.I.C.
This one girl she's makin' my body feel
I'm up on hypnotic and ice cream

So I stepped to her like I knew her
Introduced her to Jacob The Jeweler
Mame, won't you come take a ride with me?
Be the girl of my fantasy
But first won't you do one thing for me
Baby, won't you come pop your booty for me?

I love it when you move so sexy
I love it when you all up on me
But one thing that I have to see
Is the way you pop that booty

I love it when you move so sexy
