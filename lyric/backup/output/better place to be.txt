It was an early morning bar room
And the place just opened up
And the little man come in so fast and started at his cup
And the broad who served the whiskey
She was a big ol' friendly girl
And she tried to fight her empty nights by smiling at the world
And she said, "Hey, bub, it's been awhile"
"Since you've been around"
"Where the hell you been hidin'? And why ya look so down?"
But the little man just sat there like he'd never heard a sound
The waitress, she give out a cough
And acting not the least put off she spoke once again
She said, "I don't wanna bother you"
"Consider it's understood"
"I know I'm not no beauty queen, but I sure can listen good."
And the little man took his drink in his hands
And he raised it to his lips
He took a couple of sips
And he told the waitress this story
"I am the midnight watchman down at Miller's Tool and Die
And I watch the metal rusting
And I watch that time go by
