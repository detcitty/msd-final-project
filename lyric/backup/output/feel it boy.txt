Baby girl, oh nah nah
Ooh Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Are you ready for this? Yeah

Whenever I got no money
She is still my honey
And there is a reason to be funny
'Cause, I, I, I said

I don't care what you say
But you can say, girl
Keep on sayin' your thing, yeah
And I don't care what you do
But you can do, girl
Keep on doin' your thing, yeah

And I don't care what you shake
But you can shake, girl
You have my head a spin, yeah
And I don't care what you kiss
But you can kiss, girl
You have this brotha a sing
