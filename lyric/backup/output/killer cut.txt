So you want to be
A rock and roll star
Well, times have changed
That's all I'll say

You still need an electric guitar
But most of all you need
That radio, radio play

All day, all day
Play and play and play

So you think that
Your music's an art
And every song
Has something to say

I'll tell you now
That your learning will start
