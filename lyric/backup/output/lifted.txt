Hey you, get off my cloud,
You don't know me and you don't know my style
Gettin' lifted, never come down
Gettin' lifted, unh,

Gettin' dumb on the drum, rum pum pum pum pum
Better run where I come, whata bum bum
Sippin' on coke and rum gettin' so crunk
Everyone wonderin' where she come from?
Got gold on my necklace, gold on my wrist
Girls gettin' mad cause their boys wanna kiss
Fast with the cash I just throw it in the bag
Everything I wanna have, well I think you get the gist

Upside downside,
Inside outside,
Hittin' you from every angle there's no doubt,
Poetry in motion, Coast to coast and,
Rub it in your skin like lotion, lotion
