For a minute it was looking like
I'd end up one of those guys spending my whole life
Looking for a special lady to save me, maybe I'll never be satisfied
Had a couple bad lucks and a couple dimes
Now that I'm looking for you, why you so hard to find?
I thought I took one step, I took two back
I'm not even close this time and that's a fact
All I know is that we'd be the perfect match
So where you at love? I just gotta find you yeah
I wanna know, I wanna know your name
Your name, your name, why you gotta be anonymous?
I gotta know, I gotta know your name
Your name, your name, why you gotta be anonymous?
Baby, I want you so much
Wanna hold, wanna feel your touch
Come fast girl I'm in a rush
Why you gotta be anonymous?
I wanna know, I gotta know your name
Your name, your name, why you gotta be anonymous?
What's your name?
(Anonymous)
Where you at?
(Anonymous)
When I think about you I get a rush
I wanna meet my Miss Anonymous
Then I see you when I close my eyes
We on borrowed time, I wanna delay the sunlight
Everything I tried to tell you I failed to
Maybe I'll tell you another time
How you keeping me so preoccupied
