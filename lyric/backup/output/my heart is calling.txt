Who would've thought of it
That I might feel like this
Some kind of wonderful
There's nothing quite comparable

The thing about it is
It's oh so innocent
I wasn't looking for
It came knockin' at my door

I'm trying to do things right
But I'm about to lose this fight
'Cause spending time with you
Well, it feels so good and that's the truth

And every day with you
I swear it brings me closer
to my only reservationis you
My sweet temptation, baby.
