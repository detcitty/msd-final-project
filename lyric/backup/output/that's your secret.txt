In this world we live, 
Still soft from birth, 
Invisible sheets surrounds us, 
So that nothing hurts.

But we're born bald and lonely, 
And we're knowing one thing only, 
But we do it one time, 
We're gonna do it again.
And when we see it one time, 
We want to see it again, and again and again.

Only for that trap, 
That I laid for myself.
