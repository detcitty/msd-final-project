Lip stick junkie
Debunked the only one
She came back wearing a smile
Look-alike, someone drug me
They wanted to unplug me
No one here is on trial
It's just a turnaround
And we go, oh
Well then we go uh huh oh

Tick tock I want to rock you
Like the eighties
Cock blocking isn't allowed
Tugboat Shiela is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd
We better get it on the go

Hey now
