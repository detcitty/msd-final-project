When he held me in his arms
When he held me in his arms and said
"Baby, baby, baby, you are the only one for me"

When a man loves a woman can't keep his mind on nothing else
He'll trade the world for the good thing he found
Yeah, if she's bad, he can't see it, she can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
