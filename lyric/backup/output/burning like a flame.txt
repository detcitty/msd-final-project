Never thought our love would last
For so long
Time and time and again
I thought that you would be gone
Still we kept love hanging on
I guess it's meant to be
That your heart still belongs to me

And now we've stood the test of time
We survived
I asked for hope and a chance
You gave the key to your heart
You used to say that i'm not sincere
I'm gonna prove that you're wrong
I'm never gonna leave your arms
Should've realized before
Your love's worth waiting for

Don't you know that
