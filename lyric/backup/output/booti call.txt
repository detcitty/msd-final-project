It's just a bootie call

Hey baby, turn around
It's not what it seems
The way I like it by the pound
Must be in the genes

Only want to have fun
No time to get sprung
That's the way it is on Blackstreet
After all, it's a booty call

Well, you know what I like
You've got it
Just be there tonight
I want it, hey, yeah

You know that it's right
All I wanna do is be
Where you're at

[CHORUS]
Why must I feel like that
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me

Sometimes I feel that I
Might want to settle down
