Goodbye, it's time for me to go
I'll call you in the morning
So I can let you know

The way I really feel, girl
To put your mind at ease
If I don't then who will, if I make it, I still
Want you to be there with me

You say you love and then you learn
If you've learned to love me, baby
You'll wait till I return
