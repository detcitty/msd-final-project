Look in the mirror, girl
By now you should know
You're living in a fantasy
And you can't let go

He never really loved you
From the start
The only thing he ever gave you
Was a broken heart

Don't be afraid to lose
What was never meant to be

Whoa, after the rain
Washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
Can you live again

I know the emptiness
You feel inside
You're thinking if you break away
