People who listen for the best sound in the groove
We know we got the music that makes your body move
We like to dance, shake a booty now and then
But you got to have the right moves to impress all your friends

Just move a little freaky, go real slow, take your time
You've got to give your best to be right all the time
If you dance with me and you like just what you see
Then I know you'll have this next one with me

'Cause we all love freaky dancin' and romancin'
Let's do it some more
You can't fail once you're freakin'
So, shake your pants and we'll party for sure
We'll party for sure

In order to move like this
Yes, you gotta have confidence
Tell everybody that they'll have to wait
For the nation to participate
