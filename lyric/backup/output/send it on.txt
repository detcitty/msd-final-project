A word's just a word
'Til you mean what you say
And Love isn't love
'Til you give it away
We've all gotta give
Yeah something to give to make a change

Send it on
On and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part
Reach a Heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it Strong
Shine a Light and Send It On

Just smile and the world will smile along with you
