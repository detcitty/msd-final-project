We can boogie down, down, upon down
The boogie down, down, upon down
The boogie down, down, upon down
The boogie down, down, ...

Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight

Let this groove, get you to move
It's alright, alright, alright
Let this groove, set in your shoes
So stand up, alright, alright

Gonna tell ya what you can do
With my love, alright
Let you know girl you're looking good
You're outta sight, alright
