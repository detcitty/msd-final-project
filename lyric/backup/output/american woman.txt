Huh
American woman, stay away from me

American woman, mama let me be
Don't come hanging 'round my door
I don't wanna see your face no more
I got more important things to do

Than spend my time growin' old with you
Now woman, stay away

American woman, listen what I say
American woman, get away from me

American woman, mama let me be
Don't come knocking 'round my door
