[Jay-Z:]
Ay yo, I got a resolution
This year, I'm playing right
No six-fifteen this year
You can stay the night
We can go bowling, it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing?
I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honeys come to the crib
Thinkin' they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses
No room service, just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil' Debbies and when your done get ready
The chicks I was fiendin' to smash
Let 'em lean on the cash
Will take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that playa shit
I need a chick that practice tai chi
That still can buy weed
And can give me some good head
And I'll make her remind me, uh-huh

[Jay-Z (Amil):]
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going
(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow, they going
