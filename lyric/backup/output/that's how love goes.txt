(Verse) 

Girl you walk around 
With Your head up in the sky,
Yes you do, now
Cause you hurt so many before,
And never had to cry, no

But, you better stop, honey
And realize, yeah
That one day soon
You're gonna have to be penalized

OH!.

(Chorus)

That's how love goes,
you gotta reap just what you sew
You Can't cause tears and run free
It'll Happen to you, like it's happened to me, baby

That's how love goes,
