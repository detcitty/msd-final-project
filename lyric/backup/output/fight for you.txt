It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you...
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Just like the rain down in Africa
It's gonna take some time but I know you're worth fighting for!
I'd fight for you!
Heybabumbaya
Heybabumbaya

I'd fight for you!
Heybabumbaya
Heybabumbaya
I'd fight for you!
Friends are cool

But we both know
They don't wanna see us together
Don't wanna lose
What I live for
I'm willing to do whatever...
'Cause I don't wanna see you cry

Give our love another try
I bet we get it right this time
As long as you're prepared to fight
I don't wanna live another day (hey!)
Without your body next to me

I'm not gonna let them break us down (hey!)
'Cause baby I know now! (Yeah!)
