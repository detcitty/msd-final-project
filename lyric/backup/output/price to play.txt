Fail to see
How destructive we can be
Taking without giving back,
'Till the damage can be seen

Can you see?
Can you see?

The more you take, the more you blame
But everything still feels the same
The more you hurt, the more you strain
The price you pay to play the game
And all you seek, and all you gain
