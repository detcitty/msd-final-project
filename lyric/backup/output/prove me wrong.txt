Living in the darkness
Sleeping in the light of day
Waiting on the bad luck to pass
When there ain't no other way
Some would carry on
While the weak get trampeled down
Only way to know yourself is when the hard times comes around
Though I maybe down and out but you best not believe
I could fall down twenty flights and still and land on my feet

Hay
Yeah yeah
Alright
