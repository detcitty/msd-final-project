I'd like to run away from you, but if you never found me I would die
I'd like to break the chains you put around me, but I know I never will
You stay away and all I do is wonder why the hell I wait for you
But when did common sense prevail for lovers when we know it never will
Impossible to live with you, but I know, I could never live without you
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you
