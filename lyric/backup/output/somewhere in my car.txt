I'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights.
That's alright cause I don't want to be alone.
There's nobody waiting there, cold and empty bed.
Words I wished I'd said come on the radio.

Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I do this to myself.
Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're with someone else.

But in my mind were somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow.
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire.
I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back.
Breathing hard, steaming up the glass
