Strut on by like a king
Telling everybody they know nothing
And long live what you thought you were
And time ain't on your side anymore (anymore)

And so, you tell me I
Can't take my chances
But I told you one too many times
And you were crying like a bitch

I'm tougher than nails
I can promise you that
Step out of line
And you get bitch-slapped back
