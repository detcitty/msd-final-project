Look at my dab, everybody sayin' dab
Trap niggas on the map, trap niggas like to dab

Trap niggas in the bowl, trap niggas on the stove
Trap niggas worldwide, play with the pie with no eyes
Dabbin' goin' in the dictionary, birds sangin' just like Mary Mary
The bricks got wings like the tooth fairy, pinky ring yellow canary

Touch down on the pack and I run it like Barry
