I'm not yours an' baby you're not mine
We've got somethin' and it sure is fine
Let's take our love
One night at a time

There's one thing that we both agree
I like you and baby you like me
Let's take our love
One night at a time

All night, love all night, practice makes perfect
Gonna get it right, gonna get it right
