Leroy, boy, is that you?
I thought your post-hangin' days were through
Sunk-in eyes and full of sighs
Tell no lies
You get wise
I tell you now, we're gonna pull you through
There's only one thing left that we can do

We gotta get you a woman
It's like nothin' else to make you feel sure you're alive
We gotta get you a woman
We better get walkin', we're wastin' time talkin' now
