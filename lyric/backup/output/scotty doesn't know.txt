Scotty doesn't know that Fiona and me
Do it in my van every Sunday
She tells him she's in church but she doesn't go
Still she's on her knees and Scotty doesn't know!

Oh Scotty doesn't know!
So don't tell Scotty!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
So don't tell Scotty!

Fiona says she's out shopping
But she's under me
And I'm not stopping

Because Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
So don't tell Scotty!
Scotty doesn't know!
Don't tell Scotty!

I can't believe he's so trusting
While I'm right behind you thrusting
Fiona's got him on the phone
