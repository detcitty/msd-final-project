Ooh, bop!

No, you're never gonna get it
Never ever gonna get it
(No, not this time)
No, you're never gonna get it
(My love)
Never ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it
Never ever gonna get it
(No, not this time)
No, you're never gonna get it
(My love)
Never ever gonna get it
Ooh, bop!

I remember how it used to be
You never was this nice, you can't fool me
Ooh, bop!
Now you're talkin' like you made a change
The more you talk the more things sound the same

What makes you think you can just walk back into her life
Without a good fight?
I just sit back and watch you make a fool of yourself
'Cause you're just wasting your time, oh!

No, you're never gonna get it
(Not this time)
Never ever gonna get it
(My lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it
(Had your chance to make a change)
Never ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it
(Not this time)
Never ever gonna get it
(My lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it
(Had your chance to make a change)
