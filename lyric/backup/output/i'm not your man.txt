Baby, before I hang around this old
Moldy, mildewy and crappy scene
Scene holding hands with you
There's a whole list of things
You're gonna have to do

Jump off the Empire State
In a paper sack
Talk lovey dovey to a camel
Scare the hump off his back

Get the Queen of England's
Golden shoes
Put 'm on your feet and
Sing the St. Louis blues

Look here

Seven days a week with you
Is more than I can handle
Seven nights of love and
Dirty laundry on your floor

Baby, I can see this whole thing
Heading into trouble
I'm out the door

(CHORUS)
