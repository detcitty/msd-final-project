Hey ey, ey, ey, ey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, ey

Hey ey, ey, ey, ey, yeah
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, ey
Up at night i'm awake cause it haunts me
That I never got to say what I wanted
Oh, my God, oh, my God
I'm not the same as I was with you

I would jump out my skin just to get you
Oh, my God, oh, my God
How could you have ever know

If I never let it show?
Now I just want to know are you?
I'm fine
Drop tears in the morning
Give in to the lonely
Here it comes with no warning
Capsize
I'm first in the water
