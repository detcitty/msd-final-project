Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm rolling on
This Is The Way We Roll, we roll
This Is The Way We Roll

Yeah, yeah, rolling
Rolling, I'm rolling

Sounds like one of those funky
M.C. Hammer cuts to me money
Yeah, that's what it sounds like, yo
This is one of those records
When the fellas get on the floor
And say baby yea I'm all that

Down the highway
I'm doing it all my way
Money in my pocket (Yo)
I'll say it feels good
That I got it like that
My top dropped
Her hand is in my lap (my lap)

Alpine kickin' another selection
The girlies keep lookin' in my direction
My tank is full
My fame is strong
I got it like that
So I'm rollin' on...

This Is The Way We Roll
We roll... We roll
This Is The Way We Roll... Rollin'
(Rollin'...Rollin'...I'm rollin' on)
This Is The Way We Roll
We roll... We roll
This Is The Way We Roll... Rollin'
(Rollin'...Rollin'
All through Oaktown I'm rollin' on)

This Is The Way We Roll
We roll... We roll
This Is The Way We Roll... Rollin'
(Rollin'...Rollin'...I'm rollin' on)
This Is The Way We Roll
We roll... We roll
This Is The Way We Roll... Rollin'
(You left turn there's high street)

Gotta keep my business straight
