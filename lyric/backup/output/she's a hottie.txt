She's sittin' by the water where the river gets wide,
thinkin' 'bout swimming to the other side
Got a Marlboro red, and a can of cold Bud
toes squished down in the Arkansas mud
Hey Mister! Yeah, I kissed her
Son, you ought to see her sister
Ya' gotta give a little something to a cold dog cat,
finding him a woman who can shake like that

Hottie, She's a Hottie; got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat
