Everything You Do (You're Sexing Me)

You take it slow I keep hangin on you tease me
You've got me beggin and out of control
You make love look so easy.

I cant sleep at night I cant breathe and I'm burnin bright
Got the fever, must be dreaming
I'm on fire and I'm burning bright

Light a candle its time to feel the heat
