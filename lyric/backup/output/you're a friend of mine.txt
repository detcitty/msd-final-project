Striking out? Well, count me in
I'm gonna stand right by your side through thick or thin
Ain't no doubt, gonna win
A walk through hell ain't bad compared to where we've been

Oh, you can depend on me
Over and over, over and over, know that I intend to be
The one who, who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die

Years may come and go
