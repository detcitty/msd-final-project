Yo, I go by the name
 (I'm yo' Pusha)
Of Pharrell from the Neptunes
And I just wanna let y'all know
 (I'm yo' Pusha)
The world is about to feel
Something
 (I'm yo' Pusha)
That they've never felt before, c'mon

From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whip on whip, it's off the hard
I'm the neighborhood Pusha
Call me sub woofer, 'cause I pump bass like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy 'cuz
Ball 'til you fall 'cause you could duck to the fetti govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side

Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm trying to show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting me, damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits
While Pharrell keep talking this music shit

Grindin'!
(Ahhh)
Grindin'!
(Ahhh)
Grindin'!
(Ahhh)
Grindin'!
(Ahhh)
Grindin'!
(Ahhh)
