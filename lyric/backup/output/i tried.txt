"I Tried"
(feat. Akon)

You know nothing come easy, you gotta try real real hard, I tried hard... but I guess I
gotta try harder.

I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it ain't my fault cause I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat getting dough

First let me explain that I'm just a black man
and I come from the darkside, so I'm having a hard time staying on track man my mind be
racing, and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet I been in and out of relationships, I'm
starting to see thats it's me where the complications at, but I'm laying back praying that,
you can't have piece of mind of me, I thought I was right but really I'm wrong, in the end
