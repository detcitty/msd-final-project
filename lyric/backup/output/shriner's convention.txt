Here they come down main street
Drums a flailin' and the sirens a wailin', what a roar!
Bands are a playin' and flags are a wavin'
And the Vanguards and Motorcycle Corps

Clowns are a clownin' to the crowd
And pinchin' every pretty girl who dares to smile
It's a glorious mess, everybody wears a fez
The parade stretches out for a mile

It's a typical American phenomenon
Where all the members have a fine old time
It's the Forty-Third Annual Convention
Of the Grand Mystic Royal Order
Of the Nobles of the Ali Baba Temple of the Shrine

Meanwhile, back at the motel

"Operator, give me room 321, please
Hello, Noble Lumpkin?
This here is the illustrious Potentate
I said it's the illustrious Potentate
The illustrious, Coy!"

"Dad blame it! This here's Bubba!
Coy, why are'nt you at the parade?
What? Well, how'd you get that big Harley
Up there in your room?"

"What? I can't hear ya' Coy!
Quit revvin' it up, boy! Turn it off!
Listen, I just want you to know one thing
You have embarrassed us all, the whole Hahira delegation! "

"Now I'll see you at the banquet tonight, son
And you be there Coy, you hear me?
Black tie! Seven o'clock! Be there Coy!
And Coy, don't answer the phone, 'udden udden!"
