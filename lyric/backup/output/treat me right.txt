You want me to leave,
you want me to stay
You ask me to come back,
you turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers,
and you wanna be friends
I'm losing my patience,
you're nearing the end

One of these days you're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on has left you behind
Don't want to be no martyr, with no one, no say
Oh my, my baby, before it's too late
