THE COVER OF THE ROLLING STONE
Dr Hook & the Medicine Show

(talking...) Ha ha ha I don't believe it
Da, da, ah, ah don't touch it
Hey, Ray, Hey Sugar tell them who we are...

Well, we're big rock singers
We got golden fingers
And we're loved everywhere we go... (that sounds like us)
We sing about beauty and we sing about truth
At ten-thousand dollars a show... (right)
We take all kinds of pills that give us all kind of thrills
But the thrill we've never known
Is the thrill that'll gitcha when you get your picture
On the cover of the rollin stone

(Rollin stone...) Wanna see my picture on the cover
