Oooh, Belle
The Lord and I've been friends for a mighty long time
Oooh, Belle
Leaving Him has never ever really crossed my mind

Let me say this one thing

I'd never go so far
Mmm, cause it's Him no matter who you are
Oooheee, Belle
Oh it's you I want, but it's Him that I need

I'd like to take a little minute just to say now... Belle
The laughter of the sound has quieted down
