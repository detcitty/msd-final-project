I'm in love with a plain old-fashion girl
She's the most beautiful person in the world

Her smile is so warm and her eyes burn so deep, ah, yeah
Softly in rhymes of love she sings to me
{Love is for love} Oh {But only if it's meant to be}
Only if it's meant to be, baby

Yeah, hea, hea, I-I-I-I

I'm in love with a plain and simple girl
