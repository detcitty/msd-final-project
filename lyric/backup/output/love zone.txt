Don't you believe that I want you?
I need you here in my arms
Although you won't have to worry
I'll spend each day in your charms

Oh I, I wanna kiss you all over
Running my hands through your hair
Oh I know a place where love is
I'll keep you warm night and day

In the love zone
You don't have to be alone
Together we can live and learn
