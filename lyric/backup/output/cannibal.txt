Rawr! Rawr!
I have a heart, I swear I do
But just not, baby, when it comes to you
I get so hungry
When you say you love me
Hush, if you know what's good for you
I think you're hot, I think you're cool

You're the kind of guy I'd stalk in school
But now that I'm famous
You're up my anus
Now I'm gonna eat you, fool
I eat boys up

Breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty
I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal
I am a cannibal
I eat boys up
You better run
I am cannibal (cannibal cannibal)
