Damn, has it been that long?
Is that what happens since I been gone, homie?
They go the game all wrong, it's too pretty in here
Let's say we take it back to the trap one time

I went from rolling with them rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top of every chart
And I will not stop
We rock and we roll and you stop and we go, we go, we go
Yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know
Yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know
We rock and we roll and you stop and we go, we go, we go
Yeah you know

In the middle of a fire, I'm so cool
Everybody wonder how I go through
All of this half of which would have broke you
Came out smelling like a rose even more juice
Worldwide, bi-costal, global, nigga's I respect
'Cause they broke po' folks too
'Cause I ain't got a damn minute ain't no 'tude
You know Bankhead ain't in no mood
They never thought we'd go all in
kickin' doors over just to let my dogs in
So many rides never catch a nigga walkin'
In a G-5 tryna put a bunch of broads in
Then we landin' laughin', wit' chicks with fantastic asses
Extravagent habitats, if you never seen tragic happen (Hey)
Make magic happen with cash I'm actually catchin' magic
In the market for lavish mansions 'n' NBA expansions
I was passin' out Phantoms in '04, so no dope ain't shit to me
Way past respect you see,
But I neva as big as a nigga felt a beat ya see?
