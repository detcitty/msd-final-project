Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much, they call her Billy Ocean
Row like a eighteen wheeler
That hoe fine but this hoe a killer
She leakin', she's soak and wet
She leakin', soak and wet
Shake it like a salt shaker
(Sh, shake it like a salt shaker)
Shake it like a salt shaker, aah
(Sh, shake it like a salt shaker)
P poppin' till you percolate
First booty on duty, no time to wait
Make it work, with your wet T-shirt
Bitch you gotta shake it till your camel starts to hurt
Say the heals on your feet or the strap around your ankle
Call that bitch, Bow Jangle
Juicy like fruit or dosh like coup Deville
Used to get loose on the goose for real
Five dollars get your ass a table dance
If you got ten then bring a friend
Hoe shake your ass to the song then
If you ain't with it then, we are gone then
We ain't no boys, we grown men
If you ain't gone dance, well, don't then
Why you wanna waste a niggaz song?
Then see your ass down doin' nothin'
