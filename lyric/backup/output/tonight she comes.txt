I know tonight she comes
She's taking a swipe at fun
She gives me a reason
For sighting my sights
Well, I know tonight she comes

She jangles me up
She does it with ease
Sometimes she passes through me
Just like a breeze
She gives me a reason
For feelin' all right
Oh, well
(Know tonight, I know tonight)
I know tonight
