You look so fine, you move so hot
Each time you touch me it's just the right spot
Can't stop this feeling, won't try to pretend
I'm a sucker for passion, don't want it to end

Bridge
I can feel you burning up inside of me
I need you bad, can't you see
Each time you touch, you turn me inside out
Don't stop me now, don't let go
Everytime we meet you got to...

Chorus:
Love me, over and over
Move me, over and over
Thrill me, over and over
I need more
Oh touch me, over and over
Tell me, over and over
Hold me, over and over
I need more of you

Make me feel good, make it real nice
Don't ever stop, I want you all night
You make me crazy, but what do I care
