Once I throw on this
Once I throw on this
It's over girl
Once I throw on this

Once I throw on this
It's over girl
I hear you knock, knock, knock
Baby, come on up

I hope you got, got, got
Something in your cup
Cause I'm three shots deep
And I ain't trying to sleep

Get your red bull on cause I'm ready
You've been playing naughty
To get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want, right?
Tell me what you want though
Tell me what you gon' do
What you gon' do

Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow

What you gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave
