Baby, there's a chance you ought to take
Chance of a mistake you gotta make
Maybe I'm mistaken too
To take my chance with you

I need you like a shadow needs a light
I'll follow you like morning follows night
When nothin's left ahead of you
I'll be right behind you

Shadows disappear at night
We both know it's a shame if you should lose one
Why is it so hard to find
