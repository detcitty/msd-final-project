I just wanna tell the truth man Your so fly your so high
Everbody around you trying to figure out why
Your so cool you win all the time
Everywhere you go man you get alot of shine
Boy like a magnet better yet I have it
Everything you wear people say they got have it
From the sweat suit to the white tee to the gucci
You can probably say people wanna get like me

But what they don't know is when you go home
and get behind closed doors man you hit the floor
and what they can't see is your on your knees
So the next time you get it just tell em
