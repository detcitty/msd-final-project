[Eve]
Come on, huh
Come on, yo, yo, yo
Some people blond peeps, red banjies
Some are moving quickly, outta town
How they gonna find her moving swiftly?
Five steps ahead of the best so that's nothing
Twenty steps ahead of the rest they left stuck
And in they face not, what not?
I can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title "hard"
Me pick of the litter
I was born to bubble y'all
Born to change game shit born to stand guard
Play games you left nameless, fame hard
Promise that it's never painless
Nigga be hard
Convinced that you can take over the Eve
Eat nigga let starve
Strong as a stallion maiden
You better dart
Is she feminine with pretty women friends all dimes!
Timberlands is how I like my men and all minds
Rough ryde you niggas hard head, soft spine
Pass the word
Must have the stacks to cross lines
Come on

[Eve]
Don't want your dough
I don't want your car
(Uh-uh)
Don't want your jewels
No not at all
(Nope)
With them other broads
You might rule it all
(Uh-huh)
But not with me
Sorry boo I got it all
(Come on)

[Eve](Jadakiss)
Don't want your dough
I don't want your car
Don't want your jewels
No not at all
(Yeah right)
With them other broads
You might rule it all
But not with me
Sorry boo I got it all
