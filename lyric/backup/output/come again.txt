Written by Tommy Shaw, Jack Blades, Ted Nugent

I was a loner crusin' with the wind
I wasn't lookin' when you pulled me in
I had to leave you like I always did
You knew damn well I'd come again

Now I'm falling where I've never been
My resistance is wearing thin
Somewhere in the distance
like a long lost friend
Whoa oh oh oh, yeah--
Lord, here I come again
Come again

Yeah
