Yeah
Yeah
Ooh, ooh, oh
My new boy used to be a model

He looks way better than you, he looks way better than you
My new boy gets it how to get me
His love is deeper you know, he's a real keeper you know, oh
Bang bang bang, I'm breaking in

tealing all my love back, giving it to him
Ooh-oh
Bang bang bang, this time I win
I thought your love was all that until I let him in
Ooh-oh
You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one
You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one that's moping
