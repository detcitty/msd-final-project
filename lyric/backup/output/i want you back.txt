Let me tell you now

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always make me
Stand up in a crowd

Someone picked you from the bunch
That was all it took
And now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please let me back in your heart?

Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
Let you go, baby
Now that I see you in his arms
I want you back

Oh, I do now, I want you back
