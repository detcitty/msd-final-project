I woke up this morning my head felt dense
I splashed it with water trying to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen she was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just give me that wink

And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
