Hey!

Ooh, slip n' slide, push it in, uh!
A-Bitch sure got the rhythm
Holdin' back, yeah I got control
Oh, hooked inta her system

Don't draw the line
(Oooh ooh ooh) Honey I ain't through with you
Uh! The harder the better
Do it til we're black and blue

Well you never know when love will come
Hey! Better get it while you got it
Little bit o' everything, ooh, even when it hurts
