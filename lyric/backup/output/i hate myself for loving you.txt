Midnight gettin' uptight, Where are you?
You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two
I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you

Hey Jack, It's a fact they're talkin' in town
I turn my back and you're messin' around
I'm not really jealous, don't like lookin' like a clown

I think of you every night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away

I hate myself for loving you
Can't break free from the the things that you do
I wanna walk but I run back to you
That's why I hate myself for loving you
