I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me

Well I'm just a slave unto the night
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me

I gave you hell through all the years
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
