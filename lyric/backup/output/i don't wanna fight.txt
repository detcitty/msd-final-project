There's a pale moon in the sky
The kind you make your wishes on
Like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon

It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere
And we both know what
But me, I'm getting stronger
We must stop pretending
I can't live this life

I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go

I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesn't bother me
