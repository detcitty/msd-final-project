To the teller down at the bank
You're just another checking account
To the plumber that came today
You're just another house

At the airport ticket counter
You're just another fare
At the beauty shop at the mall
Well you're just another head of hair

Well that's alright, that's ok
If you don't feel important, honey
All I've got to say is
