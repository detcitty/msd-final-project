Down on the West Coast they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'."
But you've got the music, you've got the music
In you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast I get this feeling like
It all could happen that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah you

You're flyin' high at push on, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me, and I say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive I'm a lush
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swingin'
