I used to be the one who made you feel so safe and strong
I could always make it right when everything was going wrong
I don't know why it seems no different now I'm on my own
And I don't know what it is that scares me when I'm all alone

I can't believe that everyone I know would lie to me
When they all tell me that I'm not the man I used to be
Don't want to hear about the things that I already know
You've got to say it isn't so, oh no, it's the

The ghost of you that gets me every time
(My obsession)
Just won't let go until it brings me down
(My obsession)

I try to hide it but there's only one and my obsession is you
(My obsession)
The little things you used to do and say
(My obsession)

Break every moment of my night and day
(My obsession)
Believe me darling, oh, you know it's true
(My obsession)
And my obsession is you
