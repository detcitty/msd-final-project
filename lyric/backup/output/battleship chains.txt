(learn C5 and G5 and you can play the entire song)

You got me tied down with battleship chains
fifty foot long and a two ton anchor
tied down with battleship chains
fifty foot long with a two ton anchor

I can't move my arms
to hold nobody
hold nobody but you
I can't move my legs s
to chase nobody
