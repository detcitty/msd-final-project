Lights out
A-ha
Blast, blast, blast

Lights out
A-ha
Blast, blast, blast
Lights out

Dancing in the dark
To the radio of love
Dancing in the dark
To the radio of love

I know that it's wrong
To be dancing with no lights on
And I know that it's wrong
To be holding you for so long

And for the rest of the night
I'll be holding you tight
So tight
