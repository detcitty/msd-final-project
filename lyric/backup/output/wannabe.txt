Ha ha ha ha ha
Yo, I'll tell you what I want
What I really, really want
So tell me what you want
What you really, really want

I'll tell you what I want
What I really, really want
So tell me what you want
What you really, really want

I wanna, (ha) I wanna, (ha)
I wanna, (ha) I wanna, (ha)
I wanna really, really, really

Wanna zigazig ah
If you want my future
Forget my past
If you wanna get with me

Better make it fast
Now don't go wasting
My precious time
Get your act together we could be just fine

I'll tell you what I want
What I really, really want
So tell me what you want
What you really, really want

I wanna, (ha) I wanna, (ha)
