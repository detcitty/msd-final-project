You look so sad
Like you lost your only friend
Don't feel so bad
You can always try again

So don't hide, go seek
Don't let the grass grow under your feet
Get out, get up, get on, get moving out
Don't surrender don't give up the fight

You give a little bit more
If you want her back, it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in you

Give a little bit more
When you think you're through
What you gotta do is
