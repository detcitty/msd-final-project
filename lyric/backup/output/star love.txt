Come with me tonight
All across the universe, we will sail for the skies
Meet behind Mars
We will hold each other as we sail for the stars

On a cosmic bling
We will kiss in Saturn's ring
Make the Milky Way blush to see the sight
Making star love in the night

I-I'm makin' love
Star love in the night
I-I-I-I'm makin' love
Star love in the night

Come with me tonight
All across the universe, we will sail for the skies
Meet behind Mars
We will hold each other as we sail for the stars

On a cosmic bling
We will kiss in Saturn's ring
Make the Milky Way blush to see the sight
I'm making star love in the night

I'm makin' love
