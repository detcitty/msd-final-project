Mike Jones!
Befo' I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holla? cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 84's come rollin' up

They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my bar now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me now

Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah, I said
