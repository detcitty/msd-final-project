I can hear the music playing
I can hear the word that you're saying
I can see the lovelight in your eyes
What's the use in looking for an answer?
I might find out
It could be a disaster
Hold on to your own time
Don't let go
Don't let go

I'm sitting at the wheel
Watching the river roll, roll on by, baby
Sitting at the wheel
Don't let the river run dry

I can see your face on a piece of tomorrow
I'll hang my dream on a road I can follow
I gotta touch the warmth of your love
(Keep the warmth of your love, not gonna)
Not gonna chance a change of direction
Gonna keep on rolling till I find the connection
Hold on to your lifeline
Don't let go
Don't let go
