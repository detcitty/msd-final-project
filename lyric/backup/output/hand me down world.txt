Anybody here see the noise, see the fear and commotion?
I think we missed it
Anybody here see the love, see the hate being motioned?

Don't give me no hand me down shoes
Don't give me no hand me down love
Don't give me no hand me down world
I got one already

Anybody here see the long distance cheer for the notion?
I think we missed it
Anybody here see the sky weeping tears for the ocean?
