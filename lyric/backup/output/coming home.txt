I took a walk down a road
It's the road I was meant to stay
I see the fire in your eyes
But a man's got to make his way
So are you tough enough for my love?
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

I took a ride in a world
I'll be spinnin' for the rest of my life
I feel your heart beatin' baby
Oooh sometimes it cuts like a knife
So are you tough enough for my love?
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
I'm coming home
