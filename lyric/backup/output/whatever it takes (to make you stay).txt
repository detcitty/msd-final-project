Whatever it takes (to make you stay)
Lyrictext

Girl, have you talked to your man yet?
My man hasn't even called me yet
Then, what about you
I haven't talked to my man, either
They have been gone too long
This is just too hard
Well, I knew it was going to be hard when they left
But this is ridiculous
He's gonna have to do something real special
When he gets back
Well, whatever it takes

I know I can't always be there,
When you call my name, ah, yeah
Sometimes baby,
I know you think it ain't fair
When I ain't there
But I care

Well baby I know,
You got a life of your own
