I remember your bare feet,
down the hallway.
I remember your little laugh,
racecars on the kitchen floor,
plastic dinosaurs.
I love You to the moon and back.

I remember your blue eyes,
lookin' into mine,
like we had our own secret club.
I remember you dancin',
before bed time,
then jumpin' on me wakin' me up.
I can still feel you hold my hand,
little man.
And even the moment I knew,
You fought it hard like an army guy.
Rememeber I,
