I work down at the pizza pit
and I drive an old Hyundai
I still live with my mom and dad
I'm five foot three and overweight

I'm a sci-fi fanatic
A mild asthmatic
Never been to second base
But there's a whole 'nother me
That you need to see
Go check out my space

'Cause online I'm out in Hollywood
I'm six foot five and I look damn good
I drive a Maserati, I'm a black belt in karate
And I love a good glass of wine
