I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you

Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
