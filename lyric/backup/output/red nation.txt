Throw your muthaf-cking Cincinnati hats in the sky
N-gga don’t ask why
Red laces in and out of them Air Max ’95′s
I, walk on the moon, flow hotter than June
Any n-gga want drama I kick up a sand dune
Peace to my man ‘Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin’ switches to the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it, nah forget it, SuWoo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don’t live in Judah’s eyes
Half of these rappers weren’t trappin’ when I was choppin’ the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma “won’t you decide”
She chose Doc, first day I poured ? like its Aftermath for life
And all I do is ride
Before I turn on ‘em I kill Satan and stick my red flag in the ground
It’s Red Nation!!!

Now Blood the f-ck up
Everyday’s a gamble muthaf-cker, tough luck
And we gon f-ck the World til that bitch bust nuts
I can’t tell ya whats good, but I can tell ya whats, what
And that’s, B’s up, hoes down
Lookin’ in the mirror, I’m nowhere to be found
