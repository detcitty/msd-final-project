Alright yaul, oh, oh, oh
(uh, oh, uh, oh, oh, oh)
Hey, hey, ooh, yeah
Feels like my battery's in need of a jump
Our love is running down, done fell into a slump
Give me a spark to get the fire burning
A get my engine movin, set these wheels a turnin
Our love could use some rejuvination
You bring the wine, I'll bring the sweet conversation
Romance is here to stay, I'll testify 'cause I need some today
So won't cha
Jump start my heart
Charge me up when I'm runnin down
Oh, jump start my heart
Lift my feet up off the ground
When it comes to lovin', Baby
Can't get enough, hot wire me
Satisfy me, don't give me up
Turn on the heat on a cold winter's morning
Don't let the seasons change and nature catch me callin
Can't let this feelin just slip away
