Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances win or lose her

See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you and that's the only way

Shake, shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
