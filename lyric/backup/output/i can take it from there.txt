Ain't nothin' goin' on in town tonight
Except the loud party crowd drinkin' too much beer
So, baby, tell me would it be alright
If we just take a little rain check and stay right here?
I'm sure we could find somethin' to do
As a matter of fact, baby, why don't you?

Grab a couple glasses and a bottle of wine
