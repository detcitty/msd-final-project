You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago

If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
