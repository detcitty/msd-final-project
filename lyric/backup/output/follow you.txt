And when the daylight dies
You'll still be there
When I close my eyes
And I'll follow, follow you

RUn into the midnight blue
You light a torch and
It cuts right through
And I'll follow, follow you

I see you on the boulevard
Like a movie star on the cover
And now my heart beats
Like a drummer

If I lose my way tonight
I know it's gonna be all right
Cause I'll follow, follow you

Cause I'll follow you
