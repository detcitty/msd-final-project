The lonliness of nights alone
The search for strength to carry on
My ever hope has seemed to die

My eyes had no more tears to cry
Then like the sun shined from up above
You surrounded me with your endless love
You are my everything

Nothing your heart wont bring
My life is yours alone
The only love Ive ever known
Your spirit pulls me through
When nothing else will do
Every night I pray
On bended knee
