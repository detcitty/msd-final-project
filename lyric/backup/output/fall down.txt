She said "I'm fine, I'm okay"
Cover up your trembling hands
There's indecision when you know you ain't got nothing left
When the good times never stay
And the cheap thrills always seem to fade away
When will we fall
When will we fall down

Jump back, gotta get out of here
Been too, too long this time
