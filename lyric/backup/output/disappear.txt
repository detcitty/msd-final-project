Say I'm crying
I'm looking at what's on T.V.
Pain and suffering
And the struggle
To be free

It can't ever be denied and I
Never will ignore
But when I see you coming
I can take it all

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems
All the fears
And the world seems to disappear

Say you're mine
And give yourself to the
Feelings that you know
I'm needing
All that you can give me
