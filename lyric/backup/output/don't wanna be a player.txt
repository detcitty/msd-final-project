Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be

Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
I'm yours, your mine for sure

I had enough of runnin' wild
I'm switchin' out my whole lifestyle
I don't wanna live the way I used to
I'm givin' up the booty cause
Spinnin' C's at the Ta-Ta bars
