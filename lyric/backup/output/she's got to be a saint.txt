I'm out late every night
Doing things that ain't right
And she'll cry for me
When I'm down in the dumps
And she nurses my lumps
How she cries for me

And she'll never complain
She keeps hiding the pain
But I know all the while
She's not feeling too well
'Cause I put her through hell
Still she forces a smile

She's got to be a saint
Lord know that I ain't
