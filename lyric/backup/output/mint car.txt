The sun is up
I'm so happy I could scream!
And there's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
Than here with you it's perfect
It's all I ever wanted
I almost can't believe that it's for real
(So pinch me quick)

I really don't think it gets any better than this
Vanilla smile and a gorgeous strawberry kiss!
