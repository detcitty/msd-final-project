I'm (x8)
Had we met at a different time we'd be perfect for each other,
Now were spending all our time, in this world come together,
My heart is aching, from all the love your giving,
Were not faking, is this the life were living?

I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you,
Now I'm right on time,
I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you,
I feel right on time,
