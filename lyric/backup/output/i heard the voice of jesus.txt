I heard the voice of Jesus say
'Come on to me and rest'
Lay down thy weary,
Weary one lay down,
Lay thy head upon my breast.
I went to Jesus as I was,
I was weary, worn and sad
I found in Him a resting place
And He has made me glad.
Take my yoke upon you
And learn about me,
For my yoke is easy
And my burdens are light
And my burdens are light
