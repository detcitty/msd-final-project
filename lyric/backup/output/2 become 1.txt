Candlelight and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it, say you believe it

Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real don't be a stranger
We can achieve it, we can achieve it

Come a little bit closer baby
Get it on, get it on
Cause tonight is the night

When 2 become 1
I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya, baby)
I had a little love now I'm back for more
