Sam
you've been waiting much too long now
It looks like she's not coming home
Sam

you've been loyal, true and faithful
All this time with being alone
If I could get that same dedication

I'd give you everything in creation
If she doesn't come back (If she doesn't come back)
I'll be your substitute
