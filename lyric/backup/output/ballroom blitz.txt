Are you ready, Steve? aha.
Andy? yeah! Mick? ok.
alright, fellas, let's go!

Oh it's been getting so hard
livin' with the things you do to me
aha
My dreams are getting so strange
i'd like to tell you everything I see

Oh, I see a man at the back
as a matter of fact his eyes are red as the sun
and a girl in the corner let no one ignore her
'cause she thinks she's the passionate one
Oh, yeah, it was like lightning,
