Ye oooh
They read you Cinderella
You hoped it would come true
And one day your Prince Charming
Would come rescue you
You like romantic movies
And you never will forget
The way you felt when Romeo
Kissed Juliet
And all this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and Earth
If you were my girl
I can give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything
