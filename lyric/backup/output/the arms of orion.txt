'Orion's arms are wide enough'
'2 hold us both together'
'Although we're worlds apart'
'I'd cross the stars 4 U'

"In the heart of a sleepless moon"
"I'll be with U 4 ever"
"This is my destiny"
"'Till my life is through"

The arms of Orion that's where I wanna be
Since U've been gone
I've been searching 4 a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without U here, my dear

'When I am lost and feeling alone'
