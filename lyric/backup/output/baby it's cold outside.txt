I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
Baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fire place roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
