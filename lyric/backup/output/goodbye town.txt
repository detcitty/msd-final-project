Right there’s the high school where we met
We sneak out back for a couple of kisses and a cigarette
And that parking lot was our first date
And her momma slammed the door when I dropped her off too late

She’s gone
Chasing that highway wind
She’s gone
She aint coming back again

This aint nothing
Nothing but a goodbye town
The streets are only bring me down
Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

We sat down on those courthouse steps
