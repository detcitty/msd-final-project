Go ahead with your dreamin'
For what it's worth
Or you'll be stricken bound
Kickin' up dirt
For when it's dark
You never know what the night it may bring

Go ahead with your schemin'
And shop at home
You'll find treasure
While cookin' up bones
But the knife is sharp
You'd better watch that you don't cut your hands

And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
And the fishes in the sea
Had gone to sleep

And they covered up the sun
Until the birds had flown away
