[Intro: T.I.]
Big catch-a-cane, big homie wat it is?
I think imma rap straight up fo deze niggaz

[Verse One: T.I.]
Now, errbody wanna be tha king of tha South
Wen, dey ain't runnin a damn thing but dey mouf, no doubt
Iz all good, y'all jus statin y'all opinion
But in da South and in da hood iz undastood witout sayin, iz a given
And ain't b[cause of wat I'm doin fo a livinIz, mo b]cause of wat I do and how I'm livin
Not ta mention wen I'm rappin I'm jus hurtin niggaz feelins (Niggaz feelins)
And still chillin on sumthin das inta healing
Made provisions fo tha clique ta continue keepin it pimpin
Whether crack was in tha house or record sales was through tha ceilin
So, say wat'chu want, and do wat'chu please
But fo fun, I shoot 22's from ya shoe ta ya knee
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So, niggaz'll cum and look fo ya if ya sneeze
Or even breathe tha wrong way, ya better do wat tha song say
And be easy, or else it'll be a long day

[Chorus: T.I.]
I'm a king! Bank rolls in tha pockets of ma jeans
I'm a king! Ya pussy niggaz couldn't see me in ya dreams
I'm a king! Top topic of all of ya magazines
I'm a king! Head of tha body, leader of da team
I'm a king! Rememba I can get ya block knocked off
