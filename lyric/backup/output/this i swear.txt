If you can't depend
On no one else
And you? re trying to make it through life
All by yourself

Look to me, I'll be there
I'll come to your aid no matter where
I'll treat you good, I'll be fair
Give you good loving always, this I swear
Feel so good about it, baby

Said, if life's ups and downs
Are too much for you to stand
And you search so long in vain
For that helping hand
