Wynken and Blynken and Nod one night
Sailed off in a wooden shoe
Sailed in a river of
Crystal light into a sea of dew

Now where are you going
And what do you (A)wish
The old moon asked of the three
Well, we're going out fishing
For herring fish that live in the
Beautiful sea

Nets of Silver and
Gold have we said
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

The old moon laughed andsang
