RAP
I am smoking on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he's, not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye
Louie V's in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block-ow, dope enough to go in yo nostrils
I take ya girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead ass rappers
It's probably one these pussy ass niggas, don't try me I'll pull that trigga
Got ya car note in my cup, and your rent in my swisha
That pussy so good I miss you, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese like I'm taking pictures

I say fuck you, less I'm with you
If I take you out of the picture
