When I opened your letter yesterday
I could not believe my eyes
'Cause I've already given all I have to give
And I think it must have slipped your mind

But I remember not so long ago
I gave it all, it's gone and I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine
Oh do you hear me?

I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

Oh these people I'm talking to don't understand
Don't seem to realize
They're listening but they're not hearing me
They're being too cruel to be kind
