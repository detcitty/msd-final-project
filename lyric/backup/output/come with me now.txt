Come with me now
Come with me now
Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' take you down
Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' show you how
Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' take you down
Woah, Come with me now
I'm gon' show you how

Afraid to lose control
Caught up in this world
I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
I think I've thought myself to death
I was born without this fear
Now only this seems clear
