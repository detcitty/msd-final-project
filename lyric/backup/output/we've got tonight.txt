I know it's late,
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are, both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry?, no one will care girl
Look at the stars now so far away

We've got tonight,
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe
Why don't you stay?
