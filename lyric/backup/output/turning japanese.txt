I've got your picture of me and you
You wrote, "I love you", I wrote, "me too"
I sit there staring and there's nothing else to do
Oh, it's in color, your hair is brown
Your eyes are hazel and soft as clouds
I often kiss you when there's no one else around

I've got your picture, I've got your picture
I'd like a million of ya over myself
I want a doctor to take your picture
So I can look at you from inside as well
You've got me turning up and turning down
And turning in and turning 'round

I'm turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
