[G-Child]
Hey, this is the G-Child, spaceketeers
Are ya in the house baby, are ya in the house
You know what I'm sayin, cuz it's that time
For you to kicks the funk online as we rewind, then it will combine

[Mista Grimm]
Smokin on the bud, feelin kinda high
Sippin on the gin, feelin kinda fly
A Warren G production sits in the tape deck
As Mista Grimm raps over laps, don't say shit
Just, listen and recline for a spell
Pass the fat spliff back and forth (oh yeah)
Stuck, unable to breathe through the Chronic
Cloud that somehow prevents me from installin fresh air

[Warren G]
Ahh, Indosmoke
Pass me the joint so I can take a toke
1 puff, 2 puff, 3 puff, 4 puff, 5 I'm feelin real high
Leaning to the side in my muthafuckin ride
With the OG gangsta glide
Woo!, hey now ya know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
Breakaway, come again like this
The LB to the C two times to miss
Cuz if you do, you break you get broke
Me and Mista G and the indosmoke ('smoke' x4 in background)

Chorus: Nate Dogg (repeat 2x)
['Are you high yet?' (repeated in background)]
Whatever you do muthafucka you betta not choke
This ain't no stress, it's the muthafuckin indo smoke
