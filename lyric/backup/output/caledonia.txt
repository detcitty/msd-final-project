I dont know if you can see
The changes that have come over me
And these past few days i've been afraid
That i might drift away
I've been telling old stories, singing songs
That make me think about where i come from
And thats the reason why i seem
So far away today

Let me tell you that i love you
That i think about you all the time
Caledonia you; re calling me
Now i'm going home
And if i shall become a stranger
No it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything i've ever had
