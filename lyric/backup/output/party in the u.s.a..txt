I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess, whoa
Am I gonna fit in
Jumped in a cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, yeah
Moving my hips like, yeah
I got my hands up
They're playing my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
