There may be other hands
But they're just imitation
Cause they can't and never will
Make me feel the same vibration

And there may be another voice
That may sound just as sweet
Could there be another pair of arms
To make me feel so complete

I'd know you anywhere
I'd know you anywhere
I'd know you anywhere...

Said I would know you
Anywhere you go
Said I would know you
I'd know you, baby
