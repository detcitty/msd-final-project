She falls somewhere in between
Levi's and Vogue Magazine
She doesn't paint on her face
But what she does she does with taste

And you can call her Plain Jane
But she's drivin' me insane
(Plain Jane) Oh yeah, you're drivin' me insane
(Plain Jane) Well, let me love you baby, yeah

She kisses with her lips so tight
Ooh, it hits me just like dynamite
Her sweet, simple innocence
Makes everyone else seem like past tense
