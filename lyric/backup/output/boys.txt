BOYS ARE YOUNG
BOYS ARE OLD
MOST MEN ACT LIKE BOYS IM TOLD
JUST ASK A BOY HIS POINT OF VIEW
HELL RUN THAT MAN STUFF DOWN ON YOU
A BOY WILL ASK YOU FOR YOUR NAME
BEFORE HE TRYS TO RUN HIS GAME
AND WHEN HES FINE THEY MADE HIS PLAY
THATS WHEN THE BOY WHO RUNS AWAY
WE LIKE THE BOYS
BUT WE STILL LIKE THE BOYS
WE LIKE THE BOYS
WE LIKE THE BOYS
White ones black ones, tall ones, skinny ones, white ones, black ones, red ones (4 times)
BOYS WITH CURLS WE LIKE A LOT
AND BOYS WITH BRAIDS ARE REALLY HOT
BOYS THAT DANCE AND DINE AND WINE
CAN HANG WITH US MOST ANY TIME
