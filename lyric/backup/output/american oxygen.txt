Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen (wooah)
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire (oooh)
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

American oxygen (wooah)
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American Oxygen

Oh say, you see, this is the American Dream
Young girl, hustlin'
On the other side of the ocean
You can be anything at all
In America, America (America, America)
I say, can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe...

Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen (wooah)
Every breath I breathe
