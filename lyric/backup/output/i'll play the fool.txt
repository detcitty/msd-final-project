I'll play the fool for you, oh girl
If that will get me over
And I'm gonna go to school again, boy, for you
Just to get my equivalency diploma

There's nothin' honey, that I won't do
When I meet a guy lovely as you
Ain't it funny what a little love can do
 (Ain't it kinda funny)
Better than poison, so much stronger than glue

I'll be a joker for you, oh girl
Make you smile when you're feelin' blue
I'll grow a tail or two for you
Spend the rest of my days locked up in the zoo

'Cause there ain't nothin' doubtful daddy, that I won't do
