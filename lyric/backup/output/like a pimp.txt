By the time I hit the door
I saw hoes on the flo'
Niggas dressed in suits
Tricking all THEY DOUGH
Me imma pimp
I aint paying for no sex
Man I'd rather buy a car
Or a new rolex
Cause I got street FAME
So hoes flock like birds
I got one hoe on her nees
I GOT ONE HOLDIN THE SERVE
When I hit the club
Imma be wit David Banner
A thug ass nigga
Wit bad table manners
We act bad (my nigga what is yall saying)
Like when we walk inside clubs
Niggas hold they gal's hand
Cause they know we run trains (choo choo) all night
How could yo gal leave me
And be wit you all night
But its all right
Cause you know we don't kiss
Like Too said
Bitches aint shit
I tried to told ya
Dat most girls really freaks
