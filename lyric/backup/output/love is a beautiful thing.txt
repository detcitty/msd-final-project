Looks like everybody's here
Had to put some foldin' chairs in the vestibule
Yeah, it's gettin' full
Even old Aunt Ruby came
Her first time on an airplane
It's her sister's girl
She wouldn't miss it for the world

Pre Chorus

And all them kids jumpin' in the pews
And Mr. Charlie in his lime-green suit
'Is a handsome man'
Remarks Widow Callahan
Uncle Joe and Uncle Jake
Haven't spoken since '98
Just said, 'Hello'
It's a good day to let it go

Chorus
