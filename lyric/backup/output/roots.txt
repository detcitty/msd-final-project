Don't throw stones at me
Don't tell anybody
Woah, woah, woah

Trouble finds me, woah
All the noise of this
Has made me lose my belief
Woah, woah, woah

I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom

I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
