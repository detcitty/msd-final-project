Hey America it's Christmas time
All year long you've been given me the peace sign
What did what happened at the present time
Right now I see more than a million peace signs
No more

Hey America don't you think its about time
After more than a billion of the peace signs
For me to start coming your way
And people to start the common mind
Let's meet don't you think its about time
For after more than a million of the peace signs to start coming your way
And you got common mind
