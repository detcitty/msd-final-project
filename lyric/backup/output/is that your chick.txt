Memph Bleek
Jigga man
Missy, Twista sho' nuff
Yeah, yo

Don't get mad at me
I don't love 'em I fuck 'em
I don't chase 'em I duck 'em
I replace 'em with another one
You had to see she keep calling me BIG
(And another one!)
And my name is Jay-Z
She was all on my dick
Gradually I'm taking over your bitch
Coming over your shit
Got my feet up on you sofas, man
I mean a hostess for my open hand
You coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
I got your bitch up in my Rover man
I never kiss her, I never hold her hand
In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man
I'mma pimp her, it's over man
When I twist her in the Gold sedan
Like I'm Goldie man, you're bitch chose man
Jigga man, iceberg with the frozen hands
wedding bands don't make it rosy man

[Missy]
Oh is that your chick
Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick
Keep licking her lips
Is that your chick?
Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thigh
Keep looking in his eyes
Oh is that your chick?
You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill
Don't you know that man kill?
Is that your chick?
Why she beeping him?
Keep praising him?
Cause that's Bleek and them, trick

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo check it now, yo, yo
Your hoe chose I
I ain't gonna lie
What I look like turnin' down chocha
Drove by, smokin' lye
Recognize a pimp, open your eyes
Hop in the passenger side of the ride
Damn Bleek, can't speak
Uh-huh, okay, what's up, SHUT UP
And close the door
Act like you been in the drop top
On the open road before
Fix your weave, then fix me
Ever gave head doing 160?
Ever seen a pair of kicks this crispy
How you love how the white wife beater fit me
M-dot, him hot, them not
(That's gangsta)

[Missy]
Oh is that your chick
Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick
Keep licking her lips
Is that your chick?
Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thigh
