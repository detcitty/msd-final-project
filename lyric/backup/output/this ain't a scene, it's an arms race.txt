I am an arms dealer fitting you with weapons in the form of words
And (don't really care which side wins)
As long as the room keeps singing that's just the business I'm in

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress

I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,
oh so intricate
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate,
