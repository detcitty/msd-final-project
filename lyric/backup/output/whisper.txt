What if I rolled the dial to the right
and let that minor chord steer this night
what if slid a match and lit the wick
what if I shut you up with my lips on your lips
let the gravel in my voice drown out all the noise
with a whisper tonight
these thoughts that no one else should hear
cut through my lips, dance in your ear
till light comes burning through that window pane
your hair's painting that pillow case
