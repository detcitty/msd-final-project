When I was a young boy
they said you're only gettin' older
but how was I to know then
that they'd be cryin' on my shoulder
put your money in a big house
get yourself a pretty wife
She'll collect your life insurance
when she connects you with a knife

Somebody get the doctor,
I'm feelin' pretty poor,
somebody get the stretcher
before I hit the floor

Somebody save me
