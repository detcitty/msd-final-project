Thinkin' about you baby all of the time
I wake in the morning with you on my mind
I think I must be dreaming, too good to be true
And it's so amazing just what love can do

Baby you've given me the sweetest emotions
And now that I've found you
I'm never gonna let you go

Because I'm with you
My dreams have come true
And baby I'm oh so happy with you

I feel so alive
'Cause this love is so right
And that's why I'm oh so happy with you
