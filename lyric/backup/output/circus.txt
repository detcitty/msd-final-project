There's only two types of people in the world:
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kind of girl
Don't like the back seat, gotta be first

I'm like the ring leader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot
When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins

Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
