Girl, you really got me now

You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Girl, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
Girl (Girl), you really got me now

You got me so I don't know where I'm goin'
Oh yeah (Yeah), you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You really got me (Oh!)
