Last night I had a crazy dream
About a chick in a black bikini
Oh she looked so good she couldn't be real
So she must be a magic genie
But then she disappeared around a corner
All I saw were three doors and the top of her bikini
I made it through the first door there was a party going on
I asked about the chick but what they said was this

Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom don't ya jes' love it
Chick-a-boom chick-a-boom-boom-boom
