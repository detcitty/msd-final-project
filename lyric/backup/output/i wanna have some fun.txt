Hello, it's me again
Don't you know it's hard to keep a good woman down
But then again, maybe that could be fun
Sa-Sa-Sa-Sa-Samantha Fox!

Ain't it funny how when I say let's go out
You're always saying someone else will get me
What's a girl to do - I like to have fun too
But you're so jealous - you never let me

So how come you can leave - but when it comes to me
Always something I must prove
You know I love you - always thinking of you
