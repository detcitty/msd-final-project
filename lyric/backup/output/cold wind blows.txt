'Cause some things just don't change, it's better when they stay the same
I'll throw the whole world knows your name, so on the biggest stage
they came to see you spit your game, oh oooh
But it shouldn't be difficult

to explain just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice he remain, Fuck em all
Tell em all eat shit
Here we go again...

Oh, God Damn
Is it that time again already?
Ok
Ya'll don't look too happy to see me

Fuck man
Don't everybody welcome me back at once
Aight, then fuck it already

You can get the dick
Just call me the ball sack

Michael Vick in this bitch dawg
Fall back, ya mutts

Fuck your worms
You never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it a sick duck
I want my duck sicked mummy

and my nuts licked
gobble em up trick yummy
Bitch, you don't fucking think
that I know that you suck dick dummy

You get your butt kicked
Fuck all that love sick honey

Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut
It's funny
Shortly dance while I dis
you to the beat
Fuck the words
You don't listen to em anyway

Yeah, struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might as well let
my lips pucker, like Elton John

'Cause I'm just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on
cuz you went and pissed me off
Now I'm sitting and pissing on
everybody

Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So fuck the Buddha
