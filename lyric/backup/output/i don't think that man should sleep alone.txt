CHORUS:
I don't think that man should sleep alone
I don't think it's fair
Do you baby

I don't think that man should sleep alone
Some body should be there

This world that we live in
Has too many laws and too many rules
The thought of you and me sleeping here
Seems like everybody disapproves

Now I'm not I'm not saying
That I'm right and everyone else is wrong
I admit I've got a problem
I can't stand sleeping alone
