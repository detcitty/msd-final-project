Leah, it's been a long, long time
Such a sight, you're lookin' better
Than a body has a right to
Don't you know we're playin' with the fire?
But we can stop this burnin' desire, Leah

Ah, Leah
(Here we go again)
Ah, Leah
(Is it ever gonna end?)
Ah, Leah
(Here we go again)
(Here we go again)
Ah, Leah

I see your lips and I wonder who's been kissin' them
