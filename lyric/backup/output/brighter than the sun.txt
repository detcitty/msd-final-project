Stop me on the corner
I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go with it

Don't you blink, you might miss it
See we got a right to just love it or leave it
You find it and keep it
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could beat the stars falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

I never seen it, but I found this love, I'm gonna feed it
