What it do babyboo?
Yeah little mama you lookin' good
I see you wanna play with a player from the hood
Come holla at me you got it like that
Big Snoop Dogg with the lead Pussycat
I show you how I go down
Yeah I wanna throw down
Me and you one on one treat it like a showdown
You look at me I look at you
I'm reachin' for your shirt what you want me to do
I'm tellin' you loosen up my buttons babe (uh-huh)
But you keep frontin' (uh)
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothin'

I'm tellin' you loosen up my buttons babe (uh-huh)
But you keep frontin' (uh)
Sayin' what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothin'

Typical hardly the type I fall for
I like when the physical don't leave me askin' for more
I'm a sexy mama (mama)
Who knows just how to get what I wanna (wanna)
What I want to do is spring this on ya (on ya)
Back up all of the things that I told ya (told ya told ya told ya)

You been sayin' all the right things all night long
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off
Baby can't you see? (see)
These clothes are fittin' on me (me)
