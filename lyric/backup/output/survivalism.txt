I should have listened to her
So hard to keep control
We kept on eating but
Our bloated belly's still not full
She gave us all she had but
We went and took some more
Can't seem to shut her legs
Our mother nature is a whore

I got my propaganda
I got revisionism
I got my violence
In hi-def ultra-realism
