You’ve got the bullets
I’ve got the gun.
I’ve got a hankering for getting into something

I hit the bottle, you hit the gas,
I heard your 65 can really haul some ass.

I’m feeling frisky, your feeling good
I guess the whiskey is doing what it should
I got the cigarettes
You’ve got a lighter
And when the sun goes down we’ll start a little fire
