It's a lot (it's a lot)
It's a lot (it's a lot)
It's a lot (it's a lot)
It's a lot (like life)

There's a new game we like to play, you see
A game with added reality
You treat me like a dog, get me down on my knees

We call it 'Master And Servant'
We call it 'Master And Servant'

It's a lot like life, this play between the sheets
With you on top and me underneath
Forget all about equality
