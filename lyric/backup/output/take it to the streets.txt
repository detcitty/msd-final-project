[Incomprehensible]

Rock on, rock on, rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on, rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on, rock on

I got chicks in my livin' room shakin' they asses
Flip mode get ya high smokin' Weed and Hash
Yo, it's all about fun sex and drugs
Makin' more money than all your rap thugs

I'm seein' broads and panties passed around
Rampage is the nigga from underground
Sweet potato, kid crusader, I want a shorty like Jada
Tits are off like a mile later

So we can get buck wild, that's my style
I'm in a mansion in strong isle
Drinkin' Don P and Cristal, yo that's the spoke file
I'm livin' like Adino Brown, bow down

I'm the talk of the town, this is the low down
