Ooo wah, ooo wah cool, cool kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City
Ooo wah, ooo wah c'mon kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City

He's kind of tall
He's really fine
Some day I hope to make him mine, all mine
And he's neat
And oh so sweet
And just the way he looked at me
He swept me off my feet
Ooo whee, you ought to come and see
How he walks
