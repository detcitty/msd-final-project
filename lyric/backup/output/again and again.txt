Listen dear
I need you to hear.
I cannot disappear
I've tried again and again and again.

I know we said
That we'd give up
You said we'd had enough
Again and again and again.

But you, you're always on my mind.
It's like this all the time.
Say it's cause you're mine
All mine...

And if you will, I will
Try to let it go.
And if you try, I'll try
Try to let it show us the way
'Cause love is here to stay
Just look me in the eye
This is do or die
And I will stay in love
