The Vise you Send me, 
Reaches deep inside, subliminally
Your words they gently whisper
Sweet nothings to me
Why don't you make your move
Set it off baby, me and you
All I wanna do is to get with you
Take you around the world the night through

(Do you want it right now)
(I can show you how) yeah
Follow me to a world where our
Hearts can run free
(Do you want it right now)
(I can show you how)

[CHORUS]
I need to know love will find a way
Tell me, do you want a piece of my

Goody goody
Goody goody
Lovin'
Do you want a piece of my
Goody goody
Goody goody
Lovin'
Do you want a piece of my
Goody goody
Goody goody
Lovin'
Do you want a piece of my
Goody goody
Goody goody
Lovin'

I've got your sexual healin'
If You put your trust in me
