Yeah, this right here goes out to everyone
that has lost someone that they truly loved
Check it out...

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious they came to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone we still a team
Through your family I'll fulfill your dream
In the future can't wait to see if you
Open up the gates for me
Reminisce sometimes, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath

I know you're still livin' your life after death

Every step I take
Every move I make
