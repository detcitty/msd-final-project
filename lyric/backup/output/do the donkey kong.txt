Wave your hands in the air, stomp your feet on the ground,
Climb up the ladder quickly, and then spin yourself around.
Open the umbrella up and answer the phone;
You can do it with a partner, you can do it all alone.

Scale up the wall, just how high can you go?
You'll surely break her heart if you get up there too slow.
Pound upon your chest and take an elevator ride;
You can get off at the top and then you look from side to side.
