Other guys try to hold her hand
Other guys want a one night stand
They all stare when she's around
I'm so proud how she puts them down
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

I don't worry 'cause we're so tight
See each other 'most every night
She let me have the master key
That's why I kiss her explicitly
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me
