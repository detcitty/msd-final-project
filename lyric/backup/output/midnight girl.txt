I may wish on a starry night
And then you danced into my life
A lovely girl from a story book
I fell in love with just one look
Midnight girl

Your eyes were filled with such mystery (mystery)
We held each other tenderly
And just before you spoke your name (spoke your name)
The clock struck twelve and you ran away

Midnight girl
Was it all a dream
Kissing and holding you next to me
Midnight girl
The story just can't end
Til you're back in my arms again
Come on in (come on in)

I've got your silver shoes (silver shoes)
In my hand
A broken heart and shattered plans
But if it takes til the end of time (end of time)
I'll find you girl and I'll make you mine

Chorus

(Come on in, come on in)
