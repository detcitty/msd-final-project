B-Boy, where the fuck you at?
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer, that's when you had enough-a

Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot? Surely I can
If you the man, I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need
A boost of energy to enter me and get it on?

You're gettin' warm, I can feel you getting closer, now baby
Down this mimosa, you better believe it's time to give a toast
To the woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade

All over your body, who's body? Your body, I can rock a party
Like nobody, leavin' time to take home the loot, choosy about
Who I let knock my boots, now let me take sight
While you're lovin' the Lyte, life ain't all that unless you're doing it right

Keep on, keepin' on 'cause you came
And you changed my world, your love so brand new
