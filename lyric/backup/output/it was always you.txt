Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning

Hazel eyes,
I was so color blind
We were just wasting time
For my whole life
We never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize,

It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
