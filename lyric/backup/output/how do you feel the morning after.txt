You've given me things
That mean a lot
A love I could endure
You've given me
A home, a family
Made me feel secure

Yet all that you give
There's a question
That needs an answer
How can you give
Your love to another
Come home and face me
The morning after

How do you feel
(How do you feel)
The morning after
(How do you feel)
After you've given your
Love to someone new

Tell me now
