Question is will I ever leave you?

The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
Question is will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no

Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham

A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playing dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They been saying it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at JD's connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay's, I was buying fitteds everyday
Kenny's caravan and trying not to catch a stray
