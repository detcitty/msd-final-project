Thought you'd change the weather
Start a little storm
Make a little rain
But I'm gonna do one better
Hide the sun until you pray
I'm a tornado
Looking for a soul to take

You're gonna see me coming
By the selfish things that you did
I'm gonna leave you guessin'
How this funnel is gonna hit
I'm a tornado
Looking for a man to break
