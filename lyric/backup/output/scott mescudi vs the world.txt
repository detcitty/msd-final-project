What up? How is everyone doing?
You are now in the world I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment

I promise you some generation next shit
Speak for the seller who I left with
Parallel levels in the dark, dark place
Tripped all you niggas to a dark, dark fate

Guided you all with a smile up on my face
As the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
I'ma spit this on stage, watch models fill my club

Nothing dims the mood except for the lateral
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world
These are more than just words
