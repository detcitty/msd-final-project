Frustration (watching you dance)
Hesitation (to get in them pants)
Come closer baby (so I can touch)
One question: Am I moving too fast?

Cause' I ain't leaving alone
I feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three

You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time
Temptation (is calling your name)

Sweet persuasion, oh (baby this is a game)
Come closer baby (if you like what you hear)
Impassioned (is what I'm making you feel)
