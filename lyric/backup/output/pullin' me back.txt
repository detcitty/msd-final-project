Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Tellin' me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Something keeps tellin' me that, me that
Everything gon' be all right

Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pullin' me back, me back
Tellin' me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work

It was all good at first, spendin' money, goin' shoppin'
Eatin' at the finest restaurants and if I'm club hoppin'
She was right thurr wit me, bottle poppin', livin' that life
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I ain't like

We didn't have a worry in the world, gotcha diamonds, gotcha pearls
But I can't help it if Chinga-ling be attractin' all the girls
Say what? Baby, I'ma superstar and that come wit it
Gotta good nigga on your side, you betta run wit it

Even though I'm on the road doin' shows
I made time for me and hurr, relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me

'Cuz when I'm outta town, always think of hurr
Might conversate wit some chicks but no one come above hurr
