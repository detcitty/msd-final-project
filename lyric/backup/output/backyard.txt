Do you get suspicious?
Watch for the glances?
Don't put your love life in the streets

Do you get suspicious?
Watch for the glances?
You better take it from me

Friends, who needs 'em?
One can't live with 'em, can't live without
Men, can't keep 'em
Not when your good friend is trying to bring you down
Down, down, down

Do you get suspicious when they call you their girlfriend
And you don't know them very well?
Watch for the glances on the side to your boyfriend
Just read the signs, I'm sure you can tell

See somebody standing in your own backyard
Somebody's trying to steal your man
Don't be a fool and let them get that far
You better stop them while you can
Hold on to your man

Hold, hold
Hold on to him
(Hold on)
Hold, hold

Trends, they feed 'em
They all jump on it, on whatever's hot
But girlfriends be careful
Because your man might be just what they ain't got, no

You should be cautious if you've found you a good man
Don't put your love life in the streets
There is a shortage of good love from a good man
So watch your back, you better take it from me
