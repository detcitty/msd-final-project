Ladies and gents
Turn up your sound systems
To the sound of Carlos Santana
In the GMB ghetto blues
From the refugee camps

Oh Maria, Maria
She remind me of a West Side story
Growin' up in Spanish Harlem
She livin' a life just like a movie star

Oh Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar yeah yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

Stop the lootin', stop the shootin'
Pick pocking on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer

Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinkin' of ways to make it better
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Somebody just said, "See you later"
