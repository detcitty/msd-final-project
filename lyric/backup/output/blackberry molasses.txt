Blackberry Molasses
One of the things that never change
You gotta keep pushin' on, the sun don't rain all the time
There's gonna be some heartache and pain

Woke up Sunday morning gotta little bad news today
They say my life ain't worth living and time is slowly ticking away
Don't think that I'm goin' crazy, 'cause thoughts be runnin' through my head
I know I gotta be strong, gotta hold on sometimes I'd rather give up instead
Seems like I'm better off dead
