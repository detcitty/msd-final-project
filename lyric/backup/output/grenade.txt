Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Should have known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open,
Why were they open?

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked 'cause
What you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah)
Throw my head on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah)

Oh oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
