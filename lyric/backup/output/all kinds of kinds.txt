Elsa was an acrobat
That went and fell in love with that
Horatio, the human cannonball

A wedding beneath the big top tent
With barkers, clowns, and elephants,
Sideshow and the oddities and all

The dogface boy
Howled out with joy
As the tattooed lady was cryin'

Ever since the beginning
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
