Plush...

You're missing me, I'm missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain't gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It's fait accompli, we ain't gonna get no sleep

A vision rolling round in my head, but I don't really talk about it
I'm loving what you're doing to me and I don't wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I'll have to wait until that day comes

You're missing me, I'm missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain't gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It's fait accompli, we ain't gonna get no sleep

48 hours of love, It's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
