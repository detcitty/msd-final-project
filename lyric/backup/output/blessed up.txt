Be who you are
You ain't trying to impress nobody
Who you got to impress?
You done came through the ranks
You've been tested, you know what I mean?
And you stood up
That mean you've been tested and you stood up
And you still standing up
So who you got to impress?
You ain't trying to impress nobody man
Be who you are, you know what I mean?
You should be yourself because I'm saying you should do shit man for other people and you faking it
I don't need you to be no motherfucking gangster for me
I need you to be a man

I got God watchin' over me from courtside ballin' like I'm Jordan cause I'm blessed up
And niggas want me gone but I'm still alive
Wake up every morning feelin' blessed up
Pull up in that holy Ghost cause I'm blessed up
