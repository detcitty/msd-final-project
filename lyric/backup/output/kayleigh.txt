Do you remember
chalk hearts melting on a playground wall
Do you remember
dawn escapes from moon washed college halls
Do you remember the cherry blossom in the market square
Do you remember
I thought it was confetti in our hair

By the way didn't I break your heart?
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart
