I helped you with your problems, 
You ought to help me with mine.
Woah, I got to know, I got to know, 
Just gimme some kind of sign.

You wanna be a lady scholar, 
You ought to know what to say.
Woah, I got to know, I got to know, 
We can't go on this way.

[Chorus:]
Any major fool, 
Down on 42nd Street, 
Will tell ya, 
There's no way to beat the heat.

You're a little younger, 
Maybe, I'm a little old.
I never said, 
But I need to be told...
