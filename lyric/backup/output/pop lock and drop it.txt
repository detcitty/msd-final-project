Toot that thang up mami, make it roll
Once you pop pop, lock it for me girl get low
If yo mama gave it to you baby girl let it show
Once you pop, lock, drop it for me maybe we could roll, oh

Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it
Pop, lock and drop it

Tonight it's gon' be some changes
No acting sadity
So stop acting and get it clappin'
'Cause I'm knowing you feeling me

Yeah you cute
But don't let that sh** go to yo head
'Cause what this cutie won't do pimpin'
Another one will

You prepared, rockin' a skirt
And ya heels so tall
And we ain't wit none of that tricking
But our bills so tall

I been peepin' you fo a while
And you throwin' it back
If you lookin' fo you a balla
We got dough in da back

Look yo color Carmelo brown
And yo skin so smooth
I'm havin' fantasies about
What you and me can do

And you a undacover freak
You probably thinking da same
I'm seein' light up on yo face
Because you peepin' my chain

And I ain't tryna put you out there
As if you a freak
So don't even take it that way
Jus' say you did it fo' me
