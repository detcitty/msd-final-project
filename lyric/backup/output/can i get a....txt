Get it

Can I hit in the morning
Without giving you half of my dough
And even worse if I was broke would you want me?
If I couldn't get you finer things
Like all of them diamond ringsniggazkill for
Would you still roll?
If we couldn't see the sun risin off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if it wasn't droppin?
If wasn't ah, eight figureniggaby the name of jigga
Would you come around naked, would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on mydick, kiss it - could ya
See yourself with aniggaworkin harder than 9 to 5
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a balla? so you can shop and tear the mall up?
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with aniggawhen his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Can I get a what what
To these chickens from all of my doves
Who don't love those, they get no dough

Can I get a woop woop
To these fellas from all of my ladies
Who don't got love for players without dubs?

Now can you bounce wit me, uhh

Bounce wit me, bounce wit me
Can ya can ya can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me

Uh uh major coins

Bounce wit me, bounce wit me

Yeah, not done

Can ya can ya can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me
