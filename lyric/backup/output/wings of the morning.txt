And so great is a man goin to be praised
Selassie I every time
I say Jah shall execute judgment and justice
And none shall escape, what me say
Selassie I leave em terrified, what me say

Boy you better put on the wings of de morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Flying on the income must fall to the sea
There is no escape from his Majesty

A long time he a tell you bout the duttie square breed
A long time he a tell you bout the brutality
A long time he a tell you bout the him fantasy
But why yo, boat men shan manakhe
But why yo, a-bout the black he body
But why yo, I vote with equality
But why yo, a-bout Marcus Garvey
We there yo, I feel love his Majesty
Selassie I, soul that kept me
Selassie I, for I the trinity
A ex amount of action been dumped onto me
No stop from wicked them no stop from flee
Ah nowhere to run and there is no void
