I got it bad
You don't know how bad I got it
You got it easy
You don't know when you've got it good

It's getting harder
Just keeping life and soul together
I'm sick of fighting
Even though I know I should

The cold is biting
Through each and every nerve and fiber
My broken spirit is frozen to the core
I don't wanna be here no more
