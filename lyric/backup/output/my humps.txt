What you gonna do with all that junk
All that junk inside your trunk?
I'mma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump

My hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump
My lovely little lumps, check it out

I drive these brothers crazy
I do it on the daily
They treat me really nicely
They buy me all these iceys

Dolce & Gabbana
Fendi and NaDonna
Karan, they be sharing
All their money got me wearing fly gear

But I ain't asking
They say they love my ass in
Seven Jeans, True Religion
I say no, but they keep giving

So I keep on taking
And no, I ain't taken
We can keep on dating
I keep on demonstrating

My love (love)
My love, my love, my love
You love my lady lumps
My hump, my hump, my hump
My humps, they got you

She's got me spending (oh)
Spending all your money on me
And spending time on me
She's got me spending (oh)
