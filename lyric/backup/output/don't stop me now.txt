Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world I'll turn it inside out yeah
And floating around in ecstasy

So don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger
Defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go go go

There's no stopping me
I'm burnin' through the sky yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit

I'm trav'ling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
