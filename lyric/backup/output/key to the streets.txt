I got money way before the deal
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
I might fuck your ho and pay her bills
Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah
I got your ho on a leash
Got a plug evicting me
We the niggas that want to beef
Cause we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets

Young nigga from the north
Got my eye on the streets like a hawk
Wrap ‘em, put ‘em on a boat
Boy you better not chock
and Ian kno I run the north
We got the key to the streets
Everybody notice me
Used to dream about 50 thousand in my jeans
Now 50 thousand cheap to me
Remember the days watching the Hot Boys and Master P
Now I'm down in Miami, one phone call, I pull up on Wheezy
All of my niggas with me, you feel me
Straps on everybody in the building
All of niggas came from dealing
Or either they kicking in doors and stealing
I feel like I'm not having no feelings
Before the fame, seen quarter milly

Came from robbing pizza man at the top of [?] building

I got money way before the deal
