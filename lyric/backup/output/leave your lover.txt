I don't have much to give, but I don't care for gold
What use is money, when you need someone to hold?
Don't have direction, I'm just rolling down this road
Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

You'll never know the endless nights, the rhyming of the rain,
Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name
