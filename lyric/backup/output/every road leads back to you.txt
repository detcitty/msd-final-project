(Keali'i Reichel and Robi Kahakalau's version)

Keali'i:
Old friend, here we are,
lookin' back at all the years and tears that we've been through.
It feels so good to see you.
Lookin' back in time,
there's been other friends and other lovers,
but no other one like you.
All my life,
no one ever has known me better.
