We scratched our names
In that oak tree
'Cause I loved you
And you loved me
A jagged little heart so the whole town knew it
Carved into the bark with an arrow through it
I came out here to see it one more time

And I got my chainsaw
Oh you know it's gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump

Love is shady
Love is tragic
