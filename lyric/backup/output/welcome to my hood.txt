I'm foreal about this shit, this the remix (welcome to my hood), let's go, remix, remix, remix
(Where ya hood at, where ya hood at, where ya hood at)

Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody and if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school chevys, 24's so you know we roll heavy (YMCMB)

Welcome to my hood, where they gettin fly like a G6, and everybody know this is the remix
Welcome to my hood, them boys will put you down on yo knees (woop, woop) that's the sound of the police in my hood

Everybody on the corner with the work slangin & bangin in front of that liquor store
Blowin money cause I live life fast with this bottle full of yak I'm a sip it slow

Singles double when triple beams takeover
Now holla cause they impalas got extreme makeovers
Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the street

Now wear the wrong color and catch a Rodney King beatdown
Kids hit with switches, mamas is qoutin scriptures
While Ludas gettin head, more gums than baby pictures
Cock my 40 glock and my partna just bought a replica

Now Asains sayin they don't keep no cash in they register (hurry up and buy)
We run from red & blue lights to get that green
But whoever got that white is winnin like Charlie Sheen

Teddy pain, teddy pain, bad man, bad man
Mixed shots, boom boom boom boom boom bang
Man we the best never the less, you know we get it hot

Fire flame flame, fire fire flame
Put me on the track and I'm a really let a muthafucka feel it, when I do it, how I do it, what I do
If a nigga really wanna test (come and test), you can bet that I'm a eat em all day (fuck food)
850 what I represent, Tallahome Florida president
Me & DJ Khaled got these haters lookin hesitant

So keep all that wackness out my ear, (phew phew) that's the sound of your career in my hood

I hope you niggas got your ringside seats, cause it's whoopass season
Comin to a hood near you, everybody know what happen when you see me comin (Back-Up!)
I be hurdlin & gotcha reguritatin & murderin everything gun shots bah bah bah bah bah bah bah

Ya'll know what it is, I'm comin to get it & others are blockin
I'm runnin the hood and nothin can top it
You can google it and you can search it

On how a nigga come and unlock it, impossible for you to stop it
More fire, thunder, pain, I go and heed the villain, he's adrenaline poppin
Need a medical situation because the way I'm fuckin everything until I'm peepin it
Why you tryna do what you already know that I'm the king with it

And, you don't wanna come behind me with it bro
Uggh, I killed this shit I ain't gotta rhyme no more
