Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, oh
Na, na, na, na, na

Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don't wanna tell you what it is
Oh wee it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but

It's this 1 thing that's got me tripping
It's this 1 thing that's got me tripping (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slipping
It's this 1 thing I want to admit it (you did)
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh

Hey, we don't know each other well
So why I keep pickin' up my cell?
