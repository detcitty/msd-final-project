Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go
No, baby, no, baby, no, baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go

My baby boy
Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes, you know sometimes
It'd be like that, baby, yeah

Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride

Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best

And don't forget about
Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
