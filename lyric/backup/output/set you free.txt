Ooh, why you're waiting ways I can't count
How many days you weren't here?
The walls were closing in on me,
But I won't live in there, no more.

There's a place in my head
That repeats what you said,
That repeats what you said that day.

You're afraid the mistakes that you made
Dug your grave but baby,
That's the price you pay.

So don't shut down this town,
Ain't big enough for both of us, whoa.

And now I've found
You'll never get enough from me,
So, baby, I'mma set you free,
Yeah I'mma set you free.

Ooh, are you waiting ways I can't count
How many days you weren't here?
The walls were closing in on me,
But I won't live in there, no more.
