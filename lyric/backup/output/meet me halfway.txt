I can't go any further than this
I want you so badly, it's my biggest wish

girl, I spend my time just thinkin thinkin thinkin bout you
Every single day yes, I'm really missin' missin' you
And all those things we used to used to used to used to do
Hey, girl, what's up, it used to used to be just me and you

I spend my time just thinkin thinkin thinkin bout you
Every single day, yes I'm really missin missin you
And all those things we used to used to used to used to do
Hey, girl, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up

Meet me halfway, right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be lookin out, night n' day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay
