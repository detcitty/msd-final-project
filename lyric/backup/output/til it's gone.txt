Got nowhere to go and how am I to get there
But I'm goin' there with you
Tonight we're runnin' on luck
If we're gonna use it all there's only one thing left to do

()
Gonna take a deep breath, hold it in
Twirl you around till my head spins
Kiss that lipstick till it's left thin
Till it's gone, till it's gone
Break every rule we eva learned
Kick back and watch the big wheels turn
Light up the night and let it burn till it's gone
