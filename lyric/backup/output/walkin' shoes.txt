Oh yeah aaallriiiight now

I've been up half the night
Tryin' to find out
Where this windin' road
Is goin' to lead me to
My little lady comin' home so late
She left me feelin' blue
She's been screamin' and cryin'
Every step of the way
And now it's what you hear me say
There's a thousand of other places
That I'd rather be
I've been checkin' on
All the things that you see
