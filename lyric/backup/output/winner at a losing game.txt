Baby, look here at me
Have you ever seen me this way?
I've been fumblin' for words
Through the tears and the hurt and the pain

I'm gonna lay it all out
On the line tonight
And I think that it? s time
To tell this uphill fight goodbye

Have you ever had to love someone
That just don't feel the same?
Trying to make somebody care for you
