I double-cross you
and you get mysterious mail
I've tried hard not to shock you
It's hard not to with the things I could say
Tell me why don't we try
not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?
Why don't we try
not to break our hearts and make it so hard for ourselves?

You lock your letters in a box
and you've hidden the key
