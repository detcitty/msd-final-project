Down around the corner half a mile from here
See them long trains runnin' and you watch 'em disappear
Without love
Where would you be now?
(without love...)
Know I saw Miss Lucy down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family and she won't be coming back
Without love
Where would you be right now?
(without love...)
Well the Illinois Central and the Southern Central freight
