Comedy 2000 baby
Iconz, street money, yall ready?
C'mon...

(Chorus:)

If you smoke weed now
In this bitch hit you all wit a clown
Got a drink that you cant put down?
When a fight, will the shit go down?
Get crunked up, (get crunked up)
Get crunked up, (get crunked up)
Get crunked up, (get crunked up)
Get crunked up, (get crunked up)

Nigga who? look at all the shit we do
Comedy bless nigga with tracks im finecing the raps
You got a hundred dolla better
Must confess in chaps
Some labels spend a fuckin mill
See these still on the rack
I got a, clique that nigga strapped ready for war
We prefer to ball then get bomb head from hoers
You know it's, all nigga when my click poll licka
Nigga shining too, make that ice look bigga
Out of Detroit? out here bangin my nuts
Perfect cut sumplying shise shit im just too much
Niggas hand will feel the rush when they turn me up
Bitches pussy will bust a nut when my clique come up
Iconz
Playa we supposed 2 shine
Nigga fuck X and Co we gon blow your mine
We got some shit for that ass if you step out of line
The way comedy take control, yall gon fall behind

(Chorus:)

Yo get crunked up, stay crunked up
Roll to the club in a navigator truck
