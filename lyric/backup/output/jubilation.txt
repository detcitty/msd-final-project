Great jubilation with some
Celebration beginning
Total rejection to lies
And deception and sinning

Sinners, take heed
For the life that you
Lead is deceiving, yeah
Nothing replaces a man
That embraces believing, no

People take heart
It's the time to be smart
To be honest
Show the reunion there's
One mass communion upon us

Sinners, take heed
For the life that you
