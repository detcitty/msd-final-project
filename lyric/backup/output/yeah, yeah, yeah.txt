I'm standing outside your window
I've been here all night long
June feels like December
'Cuz I'm out here all alone
If you come down to the back door
I'll climb down from this tree
Baby you can grab your steps
And take a walk with me

Now that you've got me speechless
So much I wanna say
I can kiss my cool goodbye
