Early in the morning I'm still in bed
She comes to me with sweet affection
Wakes me with kisses, "Hello, sleepyhead!"
Gets me moving in the right direction
I do my best to give her love that lasts forever
It seems like everything I do I'm doing better

Doing it all for my baby
Because she's as fine as she can be
I'm doing it all for my baby
For everything she does for me
