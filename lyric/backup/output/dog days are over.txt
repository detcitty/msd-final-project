Happiness hit her, like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners, and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses, and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with her drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
