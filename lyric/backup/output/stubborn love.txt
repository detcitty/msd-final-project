She‘ll lie and steal and cheat, and beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She‘ll tear a hole in you, the one you can‘t repair
But I still love her, I don‘t really care

When we were young
Ooooh, we did enough
When it got cold
Ooooh, we bundled up
I can't be told
Aaaah, can't be done
