Komo sambe kong kong!
woo wooo woo
He lived in the jungle where he was born the king
his great strength made him lord of everything
no creature crossed his path and lived for long
his name, so legend tells us, was king kong
his height was never measured but was great
the jungle shook beneath his mighty weight
his arms were muscled, sturdy as a tree
his chest was thick and wide as it could be
Komo sambe, king kong
komo sambe kong (king kong)
komo sambe (king kong)
