paroles officielles {How We Do (feat The Game)}

This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

Fresh like, unhh; Impala, unnh
Crome hyrdolics, 808 drums
You don't want, none
Nigga betta, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, drum
Come get, some
Pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
Since red, rum
Ready here I, come
Compton, unh
Dre found me in the, slums
Sellin that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin rocks when Master P was sayin Unnnh
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
