Ooooh...
You might not ever get rich
But let me tell you it's better than digging a ditch
There ain't no telling who you might meet
A moviestar or maybe even an Indian chief

Working at the car wash
Working at the car wash, yeah
Come on and sing it with me, car wash
Sing it with the feeling now, car wash yeah
