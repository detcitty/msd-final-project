This goes out to the beautiful girls
Which one of y'all, which, which one
Which, which one of y'all
Which one of y'all goin' home with Trigga?

I see you at the club, ooh, shawty
Walkin' past a nigga lookin' at me all naughty
Then I said, "Baby, wassup?"
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug

Bottles of the Ace got me with a lil' buzz
Up in VIP with all my thug niggas
You leaned over and said you want me

Girl, when the valet pull the Benz up
Off to the crib, shawty, where we gonna end up
Girl, sit back, relax, hold up
Let me turn the radio on

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think

Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
