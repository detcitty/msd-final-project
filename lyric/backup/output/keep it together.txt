One, two, three
Hit it

Keep, keep it together
Forever keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever keep people together

Keep, keep it together
Forever keep people together
Keep, keep it together
Forever keep people together

I got brothers
I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle
Tell you what I'm gonna do

Gonna get out of here
I'm gonna leave this place
So I can forget
Every single hungry face

I'm tired of sharin' all
The hand me downs
To get attention I must
Always be the clown

I wanna be different
I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said, "Listen
You will always have a home"

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of your history
