ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo through the alley down below, oh yeah

Let's dance together just for the night
Let's don't worry about the future or nothing else
'Cause like the music's saying you gotta take chances
Go ahead, just do it and trust yourself
