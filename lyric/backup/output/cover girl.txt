I get up in the morning and I see your face, girl
You're looking so good, everything's in place
Don't you know, I could never leave your side, girl
Won't you stay here with me and be my bride?

Don't you know you're my kind?
You're just what I like, girl, you're everything
Don't you know you're alright?
The only girl, I've always needed for so long

Oh oh oh, she's my cover girl
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
