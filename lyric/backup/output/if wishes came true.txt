All alone silence fills my room
But in a memory I hear you calling me
Close my eyes and I'm there with you
Like it was yesterday but then it fades away

Take me back, turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
(Warm September rain)
Back before my heart was filled the pain
If only we could be in love that way again

If whishes came true and all the dreams at night
Of love were real, Id be holding you
If whishes came true
