I'm feelin' really unapprecited
You taking my love for granted, baby
And I don't know, how much more, I can take from you
You don't do the things you used to do
You don't even say "I love you too"
And lately I been feelin', feelin' unappreciated

Woke up this morning and saw your face
And you didn't look the same as yesterday
I got the feeling that you can't seem to see,
Where you want to be.
And lately it ain't been the same at all.
When you're here its like I'm invisible
I still can't seem to see where I went wrong.
Cause I'm feeling

I'm feeling really unappreciated.
Your takin' my love for granted, babe.
and I don't know how much more,
I can take from you.
