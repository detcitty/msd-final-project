Let me tell you what I want to say
You're the only one who can make me feel this way

My kind of lady
No better love could I embrace
No better heart, no other face
Can quite compare with you
You came along and then you mend my broken dreams
I was so down and then as foolish as it seems
You gave me your affection
Yeh baby you came through

We'll make it you'll see
In spite of those who say it's wrong
