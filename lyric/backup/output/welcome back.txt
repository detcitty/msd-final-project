Welcome back
Your dreams were
Your ticket out
Welcome back
To that same old place
That you laughed about

Well, the names
Have all changed
Since you hung around
But those dreams
Have remained and
They've turned around

Who'd have thought they'd lead you
(Who'd have thought they'd lead you)
Back here where we need you
(Back here where we need you)

Yeah, we tease him a lot
Cause we got him on the spot
Welcome back

Welcome back
