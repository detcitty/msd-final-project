All my friends, they're different people
Anxious like the ocean in a storm
When we go out, yeah, we're electric
Coursing through our bodies 'til we're one

And why mess up a good thing, baby?
It's a risk to even fall in love
So, when you give that look to me
I better look back carefully
â€˜Cause this is trouble, yeah this is trouble

I said ooh, ooh
You got me in the mood, mood
I'm scared
But if my heart's gonna break before the night will end
