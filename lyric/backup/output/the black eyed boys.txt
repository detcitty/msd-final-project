(Sounds of a motorcycle)

Oh the black-eyed boys
They motorcycled into town
The people cried
"It's the black-eyed gang
Oh and what a super band"

Oh the black-eyed boys
They laid a rockin' rhythm down
You feel a town start to come alive
Everytime the black-eyed boys arrive

Well now the leader of the band
He was the drummer
He beat a rhythm like a big tatoo
And you could see he put
All his heart and soul in
