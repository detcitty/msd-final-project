Woo!
Ah, yeah!

Callin' out, around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here, and the time is right
For dancin' in the street

They're dancin' in Chicago (They'll be dancin')
Down in New Orleans (Dancin' in the streets)
Up in New York City (Dancing in the streets)

All we need is music (Sweet sweet)
Sweet music (sweet sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere (sweet music everywhere)

(Ooh-oo-ooh) There'll be swingin', swayin', records playin'
Dancin' in the street
