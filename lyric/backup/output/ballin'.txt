Ballin, Ballin, Ballin, Ballin...

You think you’re ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball

You think you’re ballin cause you got a block?
He think he ballin cause he got a block?
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You know these hoes came to see me ball

Hopped up out the bed, I think my roof gone
Think I forgot to put my roof on
Said “f-ck it, buy another car”
Hopped out the Lamb’
Said “f-ck it, bought another car”
I bought the Phantom just to say it’s black
I bought the Phantom just to take a nap
I’m getting head in the backseat
I might stop and stand it tall like a athlete
I’m ballin’ hard, I need a jersey on
So much bread on me, I can buy a Jersey home
I’m on them Diddy’s, spendin’ Dirty Money
I’m on that Jizzle, spendin’ my money

You think you’re ballin cause you got a block?
