Oooooooh, I will

Don't cry baby
Kiss me and say farewell
Nothing's gonna break the spell
And if you're thinking time will tell me girl
I want you to know.

Every minute of every single day
Even when I'm miles away (miles away)
I'll keep the promises I made
I want you to know.

I will be faithful to my lover's prayer
Faithful - and I don't care
If the world around us gives up on love
I will make you see
You can count on me
I will be faithful -
Faithful to my lover's prayer
To my lover's prayer
