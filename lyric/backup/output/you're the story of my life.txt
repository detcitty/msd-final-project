When I turn back all the pages
Of my life through all the stages
It`s been you through all the changes
I been through... it was always you
There to make me be strong
And helping me to hold on through it all
It was your love that got me through the night
No one`s ever known me better baby, through your eyes
I can see the mirror of my soul...
