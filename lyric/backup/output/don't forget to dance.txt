You look out of your window,
Into the night.
Could be rain, could be snow,
But it can't feel as cold as you're feeling inside.

And all of you friends are either married, vanished,
Or just left alone.
But that's no reason to just stop living.
That's no excuse to just give in to a sad and lonely heart.

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no,
