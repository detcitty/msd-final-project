Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out
Move it in and about disco lady

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it around, disco lady

Hey sexy lady
Said I like the way you move your thang, Lord, have mercy girl
you dance so fine, and you're right on time
Girl you ought to be on TV on soul train

When you get the groove, it ain't no stoppin'
Just can't help it, but I'm, I'm finger pop-pin

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it round, disco lady
