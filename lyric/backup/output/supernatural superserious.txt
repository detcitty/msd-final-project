Everybody here
Comes from somewhere
But they would just as soon forget
and disguise
At the summer camp where you volunteered
No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
If that apparition had just appeared
Took you up and away from this place and sheer humiliation
Of your teenage station
Nobody cares no one remembers and nobody cares

Yeah you cried and you cried
He's alive he's alive
