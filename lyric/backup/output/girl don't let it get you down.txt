Don't let it get you down, girl
Don't let it get you down
I'll bring you back around, girl
I'll bring you back around

He broke your heart
And made you cry
He took your love
Then said goodbye

You live and you learn
Experience will teach you every time
I told you I'd be standing here
'Cause I'm the next in line

Don't you let it get you down, girl
