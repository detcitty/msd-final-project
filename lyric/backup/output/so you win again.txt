Just to admit one mistake
That can be hard to take
I know we've made them fall
But only fools come back for more
Being the fool I am
I figured in all your plans, darling
Your perfumed letters didn't say
That you'd be leaving any day

So you win again, you win again
Here I stand again, the loser
And just for fun you took my love and run
