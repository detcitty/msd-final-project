You like to dance and listen to the music
I like to sing with the band
You like your hands splashing in the ocean
Well I like my feet on the sand
Does anybody have it any better?
Isn't it easy to see just how well we fit together?

When I start to sing the blues
You pull out my dancing shoes
Oh you could be so good for me
You get brave when I get shy
Just another reason why
