You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
The club can't even handle me right now
I own the night, and I don't need no help

Gotta be the feeling that Scarface felt
Stuntin', go wild can't handle this player
Life of the club, arrogant like, yeah
Top like money, so the girls just melt
Want too many, all know me like Twelve
Look like cash and they all just stare
Bottles, models, standin' on chairs
Fall out 'cause that's the business
All out, it's so ridiculous
Zone out so much attention
Scream out, "I'm in the building"
They watchin', I know this
I'm rockin', I'm rolling
I'm holding, I know it
You know it
You know I know how
