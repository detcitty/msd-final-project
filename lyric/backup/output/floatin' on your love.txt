Do You Wanna Float On? Yeah, (Woh Ooh Oh)
Do You Wanna Float On? Yeah, (Woh Ooh Oh)
Float On - Float On - Flaotin' On Your Love
No, No, No, No, No Ooh Oh Baby, Ooh!
I Call My Baby's Name
She Gives Me Everything
She Takes me Higher and Higher
She Plays With My Desire
She Knows My Pleasure Zone

Her Love Is Slow And Slick
Told Me Don't Come Too Quick Oh!
