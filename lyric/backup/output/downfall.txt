Fear in me so deep
(ahh)
It gets the best of me
In the fear i fall
Face to face with me
(Fear)

Here i stand
hold back so no one can see
I feel these wounds
Step down, Step down
Step down

Am i breaking
(Breaking)
Down?
Can i break away?
Push me away?
Make me fall

Just to see me
Another side of me
Push me away
You can see
What i see
