Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road,
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones.
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console.
Memory lane up in the headlights,
It's got me reminiscing on them good times.
I'm turning off of real life, drivin' that's right,
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires.

Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go.
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road.
Jump the barbwire, spread the word.
Light the bonfire, then call the girls.
The king in the can and the Marlboro man.
Jack'n'Jim were a few good men.
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too.
Better watch out for the boys in blue.

And all this small town he said, she said,
