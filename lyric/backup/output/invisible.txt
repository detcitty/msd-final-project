You've got me so confused and there's word I could use
But I'm afraid to say them.
I feel I've been had and i'm boiling mad

Still I can't live without you.
You don't have the time and you won't spend a dime
Not even to call me.
You don't know I exist and I wouldn't be missed
If I had the nerve to quit you.

Invisible - I feel like I'm invisible.
