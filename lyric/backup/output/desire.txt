Ah... Ah...
We may be big or small or black or white, eternally
And black and white is you and me in a special light
We may be young or old or in between, but this much I know
Together we can learn to grow
In a world that's ever turning it's back on you
If you give it all away,
make it mine, ine, ine, ine, mine
You are desire, everything you need
I give you right or wrong
