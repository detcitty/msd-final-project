Getting Brain While I'm Talking On Da Phone

Real Street Niggas Aint No Clone
We At Da Top Where We Belong
Straight Lean, Rozay', Patron
Smoking On thousand Dollas Worth Of Strong
When Da Club Bout To Hear Dis Sooonngg

(Verse 1 YC)
Gotta Car Lot In My Garage
Gotta Condo Down Near The Stars
I'm Geeked Up Off Dem Bars
Gotta Car, I Aint Even Gotta Park
No Key Push Button To Start
She Aint A Dime I Won't Get Hard
Got Hoe's Dat Need A Green Card
Say Ima Dogg But I Don't Even Bark
Got Em Biting This Swag Like Sharks
When I Hit It Ima Knock It Out The Park
Trap Beat So Got Damn Hard
Got Kush, Got Lean, Got Bars
Got Remix Hard To Scale
Got Bricks don't Need No Scale
I'm Plugged In With The Mayor
I'm Part Of The Cartel
That ReRock Aint No Clean
62 Hundred For A Neen
Said Fuck It All Up On Jeans
Ima True Religion Fiend
