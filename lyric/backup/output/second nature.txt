Hey, hey
I wanna read it
In my magazine
I wanna hear it
On my radio

There's no limit
To the magic
Of this love
That we know
Whoa, whoa

And it's deeper
Than any eye can see
But it's more
Than just a mystery
This feeling's takin' over me

The way we do
The things we do
Second nature

The way we made
Our fantasy come true
Second nature

Well, it's a finger-snappin'
Be-bop can't-stop thing
Second nature
Whoa, whoa
