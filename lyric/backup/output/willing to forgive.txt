I read her letters
And I saw her picture
And I smelled her cheap perfume, hmm
It must have come from you

How could you touch her
Lay down beside her
Well, there just ain't no excuse
You shouldn't have been so loose

I saw the telephone bill
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can smooth it over
Then you're wasting your time

Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinkin' that I'm gonna mess around some time

You're such a liar
You took her and her children
