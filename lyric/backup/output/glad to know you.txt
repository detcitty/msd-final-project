You wandered in upon my life
And haven't lost me yet
Said the turkey to the carving knife:
"What you give is what you get"
A fresh and lovely summers day, 
We thought would never end
Said the bloodhound to the stag at bay:
"I thought you were my friend"

I thought you are my friend
Glad to know you, and by way of welcome
Pleased to meet you

We laugh and cry as lovers will
And howl at many moons
Said the waiter as he wrote the bill, 
"Please return the spoons"
As hand in hand we wander on
Through life's own wondrous maze
