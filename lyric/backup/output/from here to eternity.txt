From here to eternity - that's where she takes me
From here to eternity - with love, with love, with love

Baby - baby - baby gives me loving,
Leaves me meaning nothing, nothing left to mean
Baby - baby - baby's got me sighing
Nearly has me dying, dying off to me

From here to eternity
That's where she takes me
Frome here to eternity
