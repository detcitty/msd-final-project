I got struck by lighting and the thunder
Wildin' in the shit from the tundra, the Winda
Help me up, someone's pullin' me under
A scorcher, flame on the brain, this is torture

Terrible, horrible, sick shit, I brought ya
Sacrifice the virgin, urban, I'm splurgin'
Split splice, I prefer to bring it like a surgeon, right
Bombs, I got shatter, bullet holes in the paper

Escape the, madness, Onyx, the baddest
Souls of a soldier in the streets of survival
If you to find the blackness, here's the gun to guide you
Fumble up, crews crumble up, under pressure God
It's hard, fuck you, broke, your tooth playin'

Shiftee, low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee, low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee, low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee, low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee, low down, gritty and grimey
