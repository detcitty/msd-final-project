Last night we went to bed not talkin'
'Cause we'd already said too much
I faced the wall, you faced the window
Bound and determined not to touch

We've been married 7 years now
Sometimes it feels like 21
I'm still mad at you this mornin'
Coffee's ready if you want some

I've been up since five, thinkin' bout me and you
And I've got to tell you the conclusion I've come to
