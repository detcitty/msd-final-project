They tell me, Gladys, you know you love too hard
But I tell 'em, not nearly hard enough
They say, girlfriend, you know you go too far
Around the world ain't far enough

'Cause I only wanna show you, what you mean to me
Everytime I'm reachin' out to you, I start to sink
I may be drowning with desire from your sweet, sweet touch
I don't care what people say 'cause I love you so much

Love overboard
My love's in need of help
Love overboard
I sure can't help myself

Love overboard
I don't know what to do
Love overboard
I'm so in love with you, baby

Baby, they say I work too hard
Not really, when it comes to lovin' you
You've got my overtime, you bring me peace of mind
And there's so much more I'd like to do

I only wanna find the love my heart's been searchin' for
I'd climb most every mountain swim from shore to shore
Just to feel the soft caress from your warm embrace
