I like a long haired thick red bone
Open up her legs then filet mignon that pussy
I'ma get in and on that pussy, if she let me in I'ma own that pussy
Gon' throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick, now come here let me dope you

You gon' be a dope fiend, your friends should call you dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
Huh, but you can't come until she, I'll fuck the whole group
Baby, I'm a groupie, my sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise I should be hooked on phonics, yeah

But anyway I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
(Back it up and dump it back, back it up and dump it back)

'Cause we like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and she like us too

And girl, I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world

Yeah, alright
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
She be jumpin' up and down tryin'a fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they want to talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all

Young Money, man this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please bring your finest
