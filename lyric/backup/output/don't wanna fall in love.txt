Ain't no personal thing, boy
But you have got to stay away
Far, far away from my heart, my heart
Don't you know what your kiss is doing
Let me tell it to you from the start, boy

I don't wanna fall in love
No, no
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
Baby
I'll fight you to the end
Baby

You've been hanging around, boy
And you have started sinking in
Whoah, baby you're way out of line now
Unaware how this all got started
Let me tell it to you one more time, boy
