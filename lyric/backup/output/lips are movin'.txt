If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're ly-ly-lying, baby
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving then you're ly-ly-lying, baby

Boy, look at me in my face
Tell me that you're not just about this bass
You really think I could be replaced?!
Nah, I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl, I'ma hold it up
You're full of something, but it ain't love
What we got, straight overdue
Go find somebody new
You can buy me diamond earrings
and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
but I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye
