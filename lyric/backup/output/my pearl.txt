Ooh, ooh... 

As long as time allows
You'll be my treasure queen
What you mean to me
Got a whole lotta
Boom, boom, boom

Girl, there's something
About your smile
Don't you wait too long, ooh
Pretty lady, let me
Put you where you belong

My pearl
My precious little girl
My pearl
My precious little girl
