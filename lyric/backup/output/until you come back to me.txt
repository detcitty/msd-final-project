Though you don't call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess i'll rap on your door (your door)
Tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)

Wanna tell you baby
'Bout changes I've been going through
Missing you, listen you
Until you come back to me
That's what I'm gonna do

Why did you have to decide
You had set me free
I'm gonna swallow my pride (my pride)
