I said you already know nigga, you ain't gotta flow
Before rap, young really got dough
Before rap, young really seen snow
In the kitchen ‘bout to make some magic
Then blow it all in magic, Pull up to my partner in traffic
Gave it to him, it was all in plastic
All I know, I ain't tryna go to jail
Heard that shit closest thing to hell
When it's stepped on make it hard to sell
When you been where I been, make it hard to fail
‘Cause I'm the realest nigga in this
Y'all know it first nigga hitting magic in that 6-45
Love to say Jizzle nigga, stay in new shit
But everybody back back ‘cause that nigga can't drive
Doors open up I emerge with ten chains
Even back then they was calling me ten chains
Ask me what I spent, I tell ‘em it's no thing
Even if I had to add it up, it'da cost like ten things
We used to take a little show money just to throw money
If it's on the floor nigga, its the floor money
If you bought it out the blow, when you got it from the blow
Then that's why the fuck they call that shit blow money
Still the realest nigga in this, y'all know it
Kept it one hundred ‘til the day I came through
My nigga hit me up saying "going out of town"
