Yeah
Oh oh it's Mr. Steal Yo Girl
Oh oh it's Mr. Steal Yo Girl oh oh
Let's go

Bottoms up, bottoms up, ey, what's in ya cup
Got a couple bottles, but a couple ain't enough
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw your hands up
Tell security we bout to tear this club up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, pocket full of green
Girl, you know I love the way you shake it in them jeans
Bottoms up, bottoms up, throw ya hands up
Bottoms up, bottoms up, bottoms up (up, up)
You know what it is girl, we back up in this thang
Money stay in my pocket, girl, I'm like a walkin' bank
Tell me whatcha drank, tell me whatcha thank

If I go get these bottles, we go alcohol insane

Callin' all the girls, do you hear me?
All around the world, city to city

Cheers to the girls, throw a deuce to the guys
Now I got a chicken and a goose in the ride

Gettin' loose in the ride
Hatin' ass nigga you can move to the move to the move to the side
Bottoms up, bottoms up, ey, what's in ya cup
