O eh, o eh, o eh, o eh
O eh, oo aah, o eh, oo aah
Yah ya goh
O eh, o eh, o eh, o eh
O eh, oo aah, o eh, oo aah
O eh, o eh
Yah ya goh

At night when you turn off all the lights
There's no place that you can hide
Oh no, the rhythm is gonna get'cha
In bed, throw the covers on your head
You pretend like you are dead
But I know it
The rhythm is gonna get'cha

Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
