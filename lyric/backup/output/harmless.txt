I apologize (baby).
I couldn't describe how I hurt inside,
So I take it out on you.

I think we're both to blame.
We storm like thunder and we pound like rain,
Just like we always do.

You say you've had enough, the water is rough,
The river between us is raging higher than ever before.
I know you're having doubts, but we can work it out
If you wrap your love around me,
'Cause I don't want to fight anymore.
