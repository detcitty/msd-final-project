It was late one night
And we had a fight
And it seemed like nothing
Was going right
Then you turned around
And you walked
Right out the door

Now it's not the first time
It's not the last
I know all about
Your checkered past
And we played this game
One thousand times before

Do you remember the night
I can see it so clear
All the sweet little things
That you sang in my ear
There were promises made
But I think you forgot
What you said

There's a real fine line
