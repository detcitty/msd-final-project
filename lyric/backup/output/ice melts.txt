Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin' somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin' somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone
You need toâ€”fuck what you need!
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, yeah, yeah

Look, I want you to myself
But I know you just left someone else
I know you did, he did a number on you
That must be why you move so icy
