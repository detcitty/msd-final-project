I wasn't born for diggin deep holes
I'm not made for pavin' long roads
I ain't cut out to climb high line poles
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer

I'm not the type to work in a bank
I'm no good at slappin' on things
Don't have a knack for makin' motors crank, no
But I'm pretty good at drinkin' beer
