On and on
Ahh ah oo, ah ah aha ah
Oh, ooo
Yeah, yeah

I can picture us in the living room
By the mantle piece
And your telling me your loving me
With ya hands on my thighs

While I'm staring in your brown eyes
And thee expression on your face
Is tellin me you want my bettah taste
So tonight were going all the way
We'll be loving till the break of day

There's nothing in this world
I wouldn't do for you boy
I don't care what the others say
