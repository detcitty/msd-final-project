Trick!
Soulja Boy Tell 'em! Yeah!
And your boy Bow Wow in the building, ha ha
My swag is too official man
Ay Soulja, my swag too man!
(Y’all can’t catch up)
Ayo Bow! Let ‘em know how you lookin’ up! Ow!

New G shirt
Yellow Lamborghini
BBC shirt with a fresh pair of jeans
Black cars, spinnin' when I hit the mall
Ya can't catch me, I'm so ahead of y'all

Marco Polo
Marco Polo
Marco Polo
Marco Polo

Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo, ay!

Took my car to the mall then I blacked out
Now my closet full of J's like a crackhouse
Ceiling so high, you would think it was Shaq house
Whip so big that it beep when I back out

Like beep, beep, ayo tell that *** move this
Bow Wheezy, Mr. "Get ‘em where the dinner's cool"
I step up in the room, put ya ice on my chain B
All the bad ******* screamin' like they angry

Some call me cocky but how could you blame me?
