I dreamed she came back home last night
Asked her where she'd been
She said I've been around the world and
It almost did me in
She said I hope you didn't wait too long
I have no sense of time
I see you've written one Last Song
And I realized it's mine
Think of all the times we talked
Sing a nursery rhyme

Close your eyes
