Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind

Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey when you knock on my door

Ooh I gave you my key

Woo hoo
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Woo hoo
Nobody knows it
(nobody knows... it)
Right from the start

I gave you my heart
Oh-oh I give you my heart

So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
