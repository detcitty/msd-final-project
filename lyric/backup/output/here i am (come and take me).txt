I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

Our love is you and me, baby
That, ah, that makes the world go round
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me
Layin' all my troubles down

Ah, here I am, baby
Come and take me
Here I am, baby
Baby, come and take me
Take me by the hand, yeah
Oh, show me
Here I am, baby
