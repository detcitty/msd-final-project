Gonna love you right
Gonna take my time with you
Gonna love you slow
Can't get enough of you

Gonna love you right
Gonna take my time with you
Gonna love you over
Over, over again

Some people live searching for love
And some don't believe no more
I've been on both sides
And I'm thankful because you're fine

'Cause it feels good to hold you
And each time you tell me
You'll be here the rest of my life

Gonna love you right
Gonna take my time with you
Gonna love you slow
Can't get enough of you

Gonna love you right
Gonna take my time with you
