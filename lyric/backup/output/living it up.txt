Ja Rule
Pain Is Love
Livin' It Up
(feat. Case)

[Ja Rule]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We all my...
Yeah
C'mon, c'mon, uh
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uh
To all my niggas that be livin' it up, we say...
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, ah
C'mon

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Baby, you're such a typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, I'ma fuck, you tonight thing
Fuck, knowing your name, get your ass in the Range
And rollover, gettin' blown while blowing the doja
Bring head to a closure
That's a good bitch
Before it's all over, I'ma leave this bitch
Probably treat this bitch, smoke better
'Cause if you ain't know, gangstas and hoes go together
Poppin' my collar, partna
Who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot
In the mug and the watch, love me
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me 'cause they ain't fucked me
