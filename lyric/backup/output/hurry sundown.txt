Gypsy's dance around the campfire, shook their tambourines
They were waiting for the dust of an outlaw, Sundown was his name
As the midnight hour grew closer and the sky begins to fall
You can see his shadow by the light of the moon
They had heard the gypsys call

She had hair as black as darkness, eyes of emerald green
And her voice was soft and tender, ooh she could sing
