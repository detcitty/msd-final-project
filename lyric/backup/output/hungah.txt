Oh
Oh, baby

An appetizin' love recipe
Just like honey to honey bees, oh
I just can't get enough
So fill me up, quench my appetite
I think you know what I have in mind (And you got it)
I'm not gonna let go

I'm burnin' with desire
I'm starvin' for your love
Put out my fire
Oh, don't ask what you should do
Be the doctor, baby, I'm in need of a cure
I hunger for your love

I hunger for your love (Just a little bit)
I hunger for your love (Ooh, baby, I hunger)
I hunger for your love (Hunger for your love)
I hunger for your love

Baby, I want ya
Ooh, I hunger
