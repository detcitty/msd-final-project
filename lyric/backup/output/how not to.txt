I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

But I don't know how not to
Think about you
when it's late at night and quiet
Yeah I know that I ought to
Be the one who is strong
and just moves on
But I'll probably turn down your road
Knock, knock onyour door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hating myself and the way that I can't help
