Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in the city I know
Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losin' control
You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold
I want the good life
Every good night you're a hot one to hold
Cause you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap
Somebody save your soul cause you've been sinning in the city I know
Too many troubles, all these lovers got you losin' control
You're like a drug to me, a luxury, my sugar and gold
