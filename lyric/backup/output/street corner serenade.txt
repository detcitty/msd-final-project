Down on the corner back in my home town
Me and the fellows used to gather round
We sang a song with a happy beat
I can still hear that harmony

When we sang de de de de deet
Whoa, whoa, whoa
De de de de deet
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
De de de de deet
Whoa, whoa, whoa
De de de de deet
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Guido, he's the one that sang down low
Crazy Johnny was a baritone
I'm the one who took the lead
And Little Jackie made our song complete

When he sang de de de de deet
Whoa, whoa, whoa
(Make me feel all right)
De de de de deet
Whoa, whoa, whoa
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
De de de de deet
Whoa, whoa, whoa
(Come on, sing it now)
De de de de deet
Whoa, whoa, whoa

When a pretty girl would come strolling by
We'd try so hard to catch her eye
