We are friends, we are brothers
Always there lookin' out for each other
In a world where so many dreams are broken apart
But when the world tries to beat us
We hang tough, ain't no way they'll defeat us
You and I will always survive, together we're strong

Heart to heart
Any storm we can weather
You and I we've become
United forever

Two hearts that can beat as one
There ain't a single thing, we can't overcome
