Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

Hey baby I'm talkin to you
Stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never choose
Even if you try, yeah
You're banging your head again
Cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love, your chance to let me know

We can't go on just running away
If we stay any longer we will surely Never get away.
Whoa, anything you want we can make it happen
