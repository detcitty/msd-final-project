He would swear by his mouth almighty

I was living in a world of make believe
When my best friend wrote and told me
That there may be a job in the city
I was living in a world of make believe
When my best friend wrote and told me
That there may be a job in the city
And you never told me

He would dream about another scheme
About another sordid hall of dreams
About a man who's king of industry
He would swear by his mouth almighty
