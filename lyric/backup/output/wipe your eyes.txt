I'm afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do
But if I let you go, where you gonna go?
We gotta make it change, time to turn the page
Something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you

We've been through couple times, you know it gets worse
We can turn this around, please let me be first
And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt
Something isn't right I don't wanna fight you

Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too but
Remember if you need to cry
I'm here to wipe your eyes
