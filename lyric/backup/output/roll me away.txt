Took a look down a westbound road
Right away I made my choice
Headed out to my big two-wheeler
I was tired of my own voice
Took a bead on the northern plains
And just rolled that power on

Twelve hours out of Mackinac City
Stopped in a bar to have a brew
Met a girl and we had a few drinks
And I told her what I'd decided to do

She looked out the window a long long moment
Then she looked into my eyes
