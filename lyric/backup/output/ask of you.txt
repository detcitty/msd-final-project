Just give me all your lovin'
Girl, I'll do all the rubbin'
That's all I ask of you
I'll kiss you anywhere
(I'll kiss you anywhere, baby)
Yes, love, even there (Even there)
That's all I ask of you

Kissin' you is not enough for me
You know I'm a big boy, and big boys have desires
Makin' love is what I wanna do
But I need a true friend to make me come together

Just give me all your lovin' (All your love)
Girl, I'll do all the rubbin'
(I wanna kiss you right there)
That's all I ask of you
(Just stand right there, little girl)
I'll kiss you anywhere (Anywhere)
Yes, love, even there
(Especially there and there)
That's all I ask of you
(That's all I ask of you)

I'm not tryin' to put you on the line
But I got to tell you what's exactly on my mind, girl
My big heart leads me right to you
Every time the phone rings
