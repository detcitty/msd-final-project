Hey girl, I'm just a small town run around
I get my kicks out on the outskirts of town
I could never do it like a pretty city boy
I'm more a fishin' in the dark nitty gritty boy
So lay back and let me paint you a picture
The way I wanna kiss you is

Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
