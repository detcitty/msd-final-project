Wasn't it good
The way that I touched you late last night
Wasn't it good again
In the morning's early light

Did you know when you closed
That bedroom door
I betcha didn't know exactly what
I had in store

Wasn't it good
When you felt it coming through you
Wasn't it good
That I knew just how to do you

Did you know you never had it
Like this before
I betcha didn't know
