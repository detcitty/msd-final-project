Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... 
Ooh... ooh... ooh... 

Sometimes it seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much

You and I are as close as two is to three
And we're growing closer together
We found that magic seed, better than love
And it will grow forever and ever

Every day love grows (Every day love grows)
Deeper and deeper
I just want to get inside of you
Oh... I wanna be more than a part of you
'Cause loving you the way that I do

Sometimes it seems like I just
Can't get close enough to you
Because I love you so much
