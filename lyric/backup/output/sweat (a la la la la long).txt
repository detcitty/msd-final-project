A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
c'mon
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
hey
standing across the room
i saw you smile
said I want to talk to you-oo-oo
for a little while
But before i make my move
My emotions start running wild
my tongue gets tied
and that's no lie
looking in your eyes
looking in your big brown eyes
ooh yeah
and i've got this to say to you
Hey!
