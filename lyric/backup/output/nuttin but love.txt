Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team

Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
It's just the way I like it

I need a girl who ain't scared to scrap
Someone who got my back
Gotta be a dark skin, a light skin
Like the type of girl that stays busy all day

But when the sun goes down
She's my sexy soufle
Somebody real who ain't afraid to work it
If you try to disrespect her face

Around and get her feelings hurt
She ain't [unverified] from your [unverified]
She'll only flex with a brother that can handle it, a
And I don't care if she's a little bit jealous

She can still be a lady while she's coolin' with the fellas
An intellectual, beautiful, sexual
Hands on her hip and when she flips she's incredible
Candlelight [unverified] from her mack

But she's a trooper if she has to spill the beans from the can
A very nice girl but not mistaken for no softy
And that's the way I like it, yeah, my black coffee

Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
Black coffee, no sugar, no cream
That's the kind of girl I need down with my team
