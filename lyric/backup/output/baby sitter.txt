When my best friend said
She had lost her man
To her babysitter
I thought she was lying
I said no sixteen year old schoolgirl
Could ever take a man of mine

Staying home with our baby all the time
It kept me kind of broken hearted
So I went and hired myself a babysitter
And that's when my trouble all started

This sixteen year old chick walked in
