I'm setting him up
All for the rip off, girls
I'm setting him up
All for the rip off girls

My man never gives me credit
He all ways plays me cheap
But a woman is thinking
While her man is fast to sleep

I know he's cheating
But I'm sweet as I can be
He thinks he's making a
A fool outta me

But I'm setting him up
All for the rip off girls
(That's all it is)
I'm setting him up
All for the rip off girls
