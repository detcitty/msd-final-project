This indecision's got me climbing up the walls
I've been cheating gravity and waiting on the falls
How did this come over me, I thought I was above it all
Our hopes gone up in smoke, swallow your crown
(choke)
On a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you
(choke)
On a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose
I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose
