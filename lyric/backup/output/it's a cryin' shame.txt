Love walked out the door, it's a cryin' shame we don't have it no more.
Love walked out the door, it's a cryin' shame we don't have it no more.

Readin' your letter, I didn't know whether
To call you up and talk again.
When I saw the name you signed, flowin' through my mind
Was a memory of way back when.
