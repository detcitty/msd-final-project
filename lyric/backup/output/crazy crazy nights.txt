Oh!

Here's a little song for everybody out there
People try to take my soul away
But I don't hear the rap that they all say
They try to tell us we don't belong
That's alright, we're millions strong
This is my music, it makes me proud

These are my people and this is my crowd
These are crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy nights
These are crazy, crazy

Crazy, crazy nights
