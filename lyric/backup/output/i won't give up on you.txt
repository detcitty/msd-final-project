There you go again hiding out on me
Another missing person
Trying to pretend that our love could never be
But now I feel the tide is turning

Stop acting cool 'cause I can see right through you
The truth is in your eyes
So I'll be strong
And I'll keep on tryin'

Wherever you go tonight, no matter what you do
You know I won't give up on you
I don't care if it's wrong or right, I'd rather see it through
You know I won't give up on you

I know it's gettin' hard, but I'll do the best I can
To make it happen
