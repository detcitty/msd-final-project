Crime Mob ho, Crime Mob ho
Hey, this ya boy Lil Scrappy
Tha Prince of Crunk
Yeah, Lil J on tha track nigga
Ay, it's time for all security to get around
It's going down

Yeah, well, I'ma gat totin', pistol holdin'
Nigga on yo damn street stompin', jumpin', bumpin'
And get crunk off in this damn thang
Throwin' dem bows up at dez hoes
They screamin', they bleedin' from they nose

But when we start to swang we makin' niggas hit the flo'
Ain't no game off in this thang we too deep off yo party
Crime Mob niggas gettin' started, Ellenwood niggas be the hardest
So if a nigga come and run his mouth just like ho
Punch him dead up in his nose and stomp his ass down to the flo'
