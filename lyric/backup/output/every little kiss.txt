Way out here, working on the docks
Everyone sees the long day through
Now what would I do without the nights and the phone
And the chance just to talk to you
Oh, what would I do now
Hey, just to talk to you, a thousand miles away, hey hey
What I wouldn't give for only one night
A little relief in sight
Someday when times weren't so tight
When the day goes down on water town
When the sun sinks low all around
That's when I know I, I need you now
Yes you're what I miss, every little kiss
Every little one, every little one
