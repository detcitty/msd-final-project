I was trying to get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I want to pull up, head spent
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired

Full time father, full time artist
Asked God, he said "grind harder"
Learn from every time you ever fail
If it never fail just grind smarter
Iron sharpens, you the dagger
On they hindquarters and they all acting
Rap game, I'm a pallbearer
Kill me and get a call after
First look, it was all laughter
Kevin Gates, no small matter
Made men believe what they didn't believe
Dive in the crowd, no safety harness
Got in the booth, no safety on it
Aim and I shoot for the stars
At the awards I ain't win no awards
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard
