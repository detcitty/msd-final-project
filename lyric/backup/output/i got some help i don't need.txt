All of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
I said, all of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
Hey and I've got a new story to tell you this evening, baby
One that ain't never been told

I went to work the other day
But I thought that I'd double back
And that car I saw sitting in front of my door
Looked like a brand new, a brand new Cadillac
