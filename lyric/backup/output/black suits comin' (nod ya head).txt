Come, come on
Come on, come, come on
MIB
The black suits comin'
The black suits comin'

I'm comin', I'm comin' I'm comin', I'm comin'
I am the man in black, I'm back
Breaking the back of the random attackers
So can the flak, yo I'm dangerous
I've been trained to bust
When a stranger fuss try to endanger us

Praise me y'all, don't nothin' faze me y'all
When they see me their gaze be all crazy y'all
They say I'm a myth, trust me if somebody riff
Out of the depth of your imagination appears Will Smith

Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style black Ray Bans, I'm stunnin' man
New hotness pitch black six hundred man

Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again?
Leave you hangin' without bringin' you the fun again
Tanglin' with the alien scum again
Mind your manners or the black suits runnin' in

Nod ya head
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you nod ya head, like this
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you nod ya head, like this
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you bop your head
Nod your head, come on

Nod ya head
(The black suits comin')
