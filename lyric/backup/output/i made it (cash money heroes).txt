Yeah,
Cash Money
heroes,
private jet,

polish, fly
I look up to the sky
and now the world is mine
I've known it all my life,
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about,

the life I'm living now

I know that there's no doubt,
I made it, I made it!
Known from the city
where no one believed in me

But I never gave up the fight.
Ya, but now I'm on top,

I told you to let it rock
The money's fallin' from the sky-y-y-y-y,
I made it.
I look up to the sky
and now the world is mine
I've known it all my life,
I made it, I made it!
I used to dream about,
the life I'm living now
I know that there's no doubt,
