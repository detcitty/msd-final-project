She's going out to forget they were together
All that time he was taking her for granted
She wants to see if there's more
Than he gave she's looking for
He calls her up
He's trippin' on the phone now
He doesn't want her out there
And alone now
He knows she's movin' it
Knows she's using it
Now he's losing it, she don't care

Everybody put up your hands
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feel the beat now
If you've got nothing left
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Back it up now

You've got a reason to live
Say I don't wanna be in love
I don't wanna be in love
Feelin' good now
Don't be afraid to get down
