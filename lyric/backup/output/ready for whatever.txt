Hate the price of fame, it cost to much
These niggas talk to much
I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
Boy, I'm ready for whatever
Hey, hey, hey

Even though my head in the clouds, I'm planted on the pavement
How I'm walkin' 'round, people starin' in amazement
I play a lot of games, but well-being I ain't playing wit'
They so judgmental, man, but they don't understand
If ya life was in jeopardy everyday, is you tellin' me
You wouldn't need weaponry just because of ya felonies?
Consider this at least, I got everybody sweatin' me
On the streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace
Killed my folk a year ago, still, in my sleep they threaten me
Paranoia stressin' me, ain't nobody protectin' me
I'm dealing wit' the pressure from my partner dyin' next to me
Think 'cause no one's arrested, they comin' for me eventually
This was all the things that I was goin' through mentally
This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary
Not mentionin' New Orleans, niggas comin' in the city
Killin' all summer long, ain't nobody pay attention

Now is it that hard to understand if ya listen?
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of decision
But I'm wrong and I know it, my excuse is unimportant
I'm just tryin' to let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real

I had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison
You waitin' on me to die, you gon' be waitin' for a minute
Boy, I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em
