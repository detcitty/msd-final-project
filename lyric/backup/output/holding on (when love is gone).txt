Holding on
Is very hard to do
When love is gone
And that's no lie
Holding on
Is very hard to do
When love is gone
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

I get you're unhappy, I know you gotta be (I know you gotta be)
? Cause it can drive you out your mind
There ain't no sense in cryin', it's time for you to leave (Time for you to leave)
Baby, that's the bottom line

I betcha lie awake nights and never rest a bit
And wish it all would disappear (Yeah)
But still the bottom line is you got to deal with it
And to yourself at least be fair

Said holding on
Is very hard to do
When love is gone
And that's no lie
Holding on
Is very hard to do
When love is gone
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

Ha-ha-ha
Who are you kidding
Doo doo doo doo
