Bring the action

When you hear this in the club
You're gonna turn this shit up
You're gonna turn this shit up
You're gonna turn this shit up
When we up in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
See the boys in the club
They watchin' us
They watchin' us
They watchin' us
Everybody in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
And scream and shout and let it out
We sayin', "Ohh, wee ohh, wee oh wee oh"
We sayin', "Ohh, wee ohh, wee oh wee oh"
I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
And scream and shout and let it out
We sayin', "Ohh, wee ohh, wee oh wee oh"

You are now-now rockin' with will.i.am and (Britney, bitch)

Aw yeah
