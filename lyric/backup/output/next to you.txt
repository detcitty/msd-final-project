I aint tripping about the lime light
cuz when im with my shawty
She keep my mind right
When we up in the mall
She feel up shopping bag
She love to popp them tags
She love to drive the jag
Whenever we alone
She throw away my phone
Cuz she dont want no interuptions while we going strong
My baby, my baby
Dont be on that bull sh*
My baby, my baby
Know i keep a full clip
Thats why i
Met her outside at 745
Thats why i
Take pride when i slide up in them thighs
My baby boo she true
