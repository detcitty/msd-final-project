If you were mine
I'd take you on a
Trip around the world
If you were mine
I'd buy you diamonds and pearls

If you were mine
I'd so be so tender
Sweet and kind
If you were mine
I'd make love to you all night
Only if you were mine

Hey, girl, listen up
Cause you know it's true
There's no one more qualified
For me than you

If you were mine
You know things would
Be kinda right
I don't beg, girl
But for you, I just might

Get down upon my knees
And beg and plead
To make you realize
It's you that I need
