Did I hear you say that
You want another chance
You need another try
You're ready to reclaim your prize

So, you want my love back
Why'd you let it slip away
Why'd you ever let me go
Your change of heart has come too late

Well, the door is locked
You can't get in
The game has changed
You've been

1 - Too gone, too long, baby
To ever get back again
In my heart
