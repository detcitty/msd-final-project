Endlessly walking through a winter thats so bitterly cold
Christmas is coming all the stores are wrapped in their neon glow
But I don't feel festive
Oh I've lost the woman I held so dear
I'm so reflective as I think of all our happy years
I brush against a stranger,
So I turn to apologize
And I saw her, with another man, and a sparkle in her eyes

Does she love that man?
The way that I'm loving her still
