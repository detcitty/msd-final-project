If you feel the funk, shake your rump
Shake your rump to the funk
Won't you shake it
(If you feel the funk, shake your rump)
(Shake your rump to the funk)
(Won't you shake it)

Now we all see that you're groovin' down, yeah
That don't mean you can't sit around
Just sit around just get on down
Now I wanna see you shake it to me
