Oh, baby I don't know why
But somehow I always seem to get
Tangled up in my pride
But, oh, baby we're not that blind
Deep down inside you know
This love's worth one more try

Don't push it all aside

'Cause I wanna be good for you
Didn't mean to be bad
But darling I'm still the best
That you ever had
Just give me a chance
