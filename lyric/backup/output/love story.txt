We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes & the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say "Hello", little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you "Please don't go", & I said...

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
