First day went out,
my heart stood still
I never had a man like you
and a doubt I ever will
Some I`m trying to play
in all these love games
Once you came into my life
I had a change,
yea

CHORUS
That`s why I`m so glad I found you
Gonna build my whole world around you
Oh yea, I wanna be true I wanna be with you
