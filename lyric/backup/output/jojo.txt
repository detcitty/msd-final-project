Look out behind you
Jojo's got his gun
He wouldn't mean to do but
Ya know he likes his fun
Jojo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights
below him
Jojo dig those Broadway nights
Flashy lines, you know him.
(You know him)
He's got you covered
You'll know it right out front, mmm
mmm
Hey fifty dollars
He'll get you all you want
Jojo dig those spinning lights
Way out games and dizzy heights
below him
