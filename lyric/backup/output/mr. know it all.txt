Mr. know it all
Well ya, you think you know it all
But ya don't know a thing at all
Ain't it, ain't it something y'all
When somebody tells you something 'bout you
Think that they know you more than you do
So you take it down, another pill to swallow

Mr. bring me down
Well ya, you like to bring me down, don't ya?
But I ain't laying down, baby
I ain't going down
Can't nobody tell me how it's gonna be
Nobody gonna make a fool out of me
Baby, you should know that I need not follow

Oh you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
