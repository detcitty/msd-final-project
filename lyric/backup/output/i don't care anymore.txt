Well you can tell everyone I'm a down disgrace
Drag my name all over the place
I don't care anymore
You can tell everybody about the state I'm in
You won't catch me crying Cause I just can't win
I don't care anymore

I don't care anymore
I don't care, what you say

I don't play the same games, you play
Cause I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
And it seems to me there's a means to an end
They don't care anymore
And as for me, I can sit here and bide my time
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind

I don't care anymore
I don't care no more
