If you like to go jukin'
If you like the western swing
Outside of Austin, Texas
I know a cowboy's dream

It ain't much to look at
Just another cowboy club
But they got jukin'
And I got jukin' in my blood

When it comes to country music
I never liked it much
Till I heard it played
With that Texas touch
