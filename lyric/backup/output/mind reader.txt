How'd you know to wear your like that
How'd you know to turn up that song
How'd you know those little tore up jeans
was gonna tear me up and turn me on
Girl its like you know me too good
but you barely know me at all
Yeah the way its going tonight
you probably know I'm ready to fall

Baby you're a little mine, baby you're a little mind reader,
yeah thats what you are
You play it off a little shy but baby you're a heart stealer
