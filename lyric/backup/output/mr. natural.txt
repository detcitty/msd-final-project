Burning embers.
I still remember all of those little things.
But I don't feel it so much 'cause I am so out of touch
with my heart and it won't sing.
Rusty rainbows.
That's how the pain goes, turning me inside out .
Well, I come home at night and you are out of my sight.
Yes. I'm dying and there ain't no doubt.
Well, I'm dying and there's no way out.
