Let's go!

Mmm...
Don't wantcha for the weekend, don't wantcha for a night
I'm only interested if I can have you for life, yeah
Uh, I know I sound serious and baby I am

You're a fine piece of real estate, and I'm gonna get me some land
Oh, yeah So, don't try to run honey, love can be fun
There's no need to be alone when you find that someone

I'm gonna getcha while I gotcha in sight
