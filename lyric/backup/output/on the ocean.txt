Man,
The moment I been waiting on
And my soul is over flowing
With anxieties and expectations
I'm full of desires
I just want it so bad
You know
And it just seem so real
It's right there
I just want reach out and touch it
Before it all disappears

[Verse:]
Sometimes
It feels like
Everything
Is passin' me by
Every now and then
It feels like (feels like)
My ship has gone and sailed away
But I
I gonna be strong (gotta be strong)
Gotta hold on
It won't be too long

[Chorus:]
Now the tide is coming near
