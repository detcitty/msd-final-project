Yeah
Its Bad Boy Baby
Neptunes
And we won't stop
(I like that) 'Cause we can't stop
Yeah
Let me tell you something
[Verse I]
Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 1-2-5 and Saint Nich
Chillin' with these chick
Named Tondalea
Was a hot girl and everybody wanted to slay her
She wasn't fond of players
Only wanted ballers
To spoil her
Six figures and camcorders
So what you trying to tell me dear
I got Bentley, Benz send in Mr. Belvedere
I just want to blow your mind
I'm talkin' literally blow your mind
My repratoir is Menage Trois
And exotic cars chilling with the hottest stars
And it ain't no stopping this
I can't help it I'm an optomist
And Ima make ya head bop to this
