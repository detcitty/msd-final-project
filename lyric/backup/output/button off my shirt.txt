I've heard the word going 'round town
They say that you're making a fool out of me
Baby, it took me some time to come 'round
To realize you were not what you seem

Each day's passing, the clock's been my friend
Helped me get back on my feet again
Like a button off my shirt
Just an everyday distraction
You'd be overreacting if you think that I still hurt
You're just a button off my shirt and someday I will replace you

I don't care what I have lost
