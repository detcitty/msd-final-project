What's the matter with the way we look?
surely it's not the end
i only meant to make my motions clear
you worry too much if it's understood
should we be seen as friends?
seems like a real good beginning right here
'cause when your heart is weak
i'm gonna pick the lock on it
my fingertips won't fail me
no matter what you do
the love you cannot see yet
