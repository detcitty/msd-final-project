You're always dancing down the street
With your suede blue eyes
Every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise

(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
Ooh, she'll make you flip
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
I kinda like the way she dips

Well she's my best friend's girl
She's my best friend's girl
But she used to be mine

You've got your nuclear boots
And your drip dry glove
