You can say I'm plain Jane, but it's not the same
I ain't into big names, but I like nice things
I watch boxing matches and football games
I wouldn't mind being an actress, but I love to sing

I like going out, talking walks and stuff
I don't run with many girls 'cause they talk too much
I enjoy quiet nights at home 'cause I'm next to ya
Though I'm ain't a virgin that don't mean I'm having sex with ya

'Cause anywhere I go I'm spotted and anything I want I got it
5' 5" with brown eyes, smile like the sunrise
'Cause anywhere I go I'm spotted and anything I want I got it
5' 5" with brown eyes, smile like the sunrise

Baby, look me in the eyes and tell me yeah
I'm the kinda girl you like, I'm feeling you
