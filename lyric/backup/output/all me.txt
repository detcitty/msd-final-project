Got everything, I got everything

I cannot complain, I cannot

I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot

It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me for real
Came up, that's all me

Stay true, that's all me

No help, that's all me

All me for real
Money on my mind, you should think the same

J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
Oh! She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line, " ok
Made a million, off a dinner
Fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!" (Damn!)
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo

Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note

From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off

And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off

This that sauce, this that dressing

Givenchy, nigga God bless you

If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)

Got everything, I got everything

I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot

It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
