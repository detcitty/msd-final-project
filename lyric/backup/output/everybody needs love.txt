Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love

You're no exception to the rule
Don't make me feel like a fool
'Cause I'll try a little harder
You'll see it my way someday
Open up, let me in
Let me in, let it begin

Everybody needs love
 (From the old man sleeping in the corner)
Everybody needs love
 (To the baby smiling in a hurricane)
Everybody needs love
 (Why wait around for the sun to shine?)
Everybody needs love
 (Don't you worry, love will find you in time)
