Your own personal jesus

Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there
Oh, yeh

Reach out, touch faith!
Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone by the telephone

Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer!
Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
