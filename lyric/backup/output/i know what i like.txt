I like things
That go fast
'Cause I know that good things
Don't ever last

I like believing
In what I want to
Don't like no one
To tell me what to do

And I like
The times that we've had
But I couldn't tell you
What's good or bad

I'm only hoping
That you understand
This feeling that I'm feeling
When I'm holding your hand

(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like)
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like)
