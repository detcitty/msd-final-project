Any more room...
(--- Is there-- tell me)
... For me

Oooo

Lookin good, plenty time
(is there room...) any more room for me...
In those jeans
Really thick, like I like it
Tell me is there any more room for me...
in those jeans
Lookin tasty, really scrumptious
Tell me is there any more room for me... in those jeans
Lookin' good, plenty time
(Is there room?) any more room for me

Got out my ride, seen you from a far (and I)
Couldn't stop myself from looking hard
(staring)
You wore these jeans (girl you wore these jeans)
And you... made a thug wanna cry something terrible
I had to have... (have you for myself)
Baby, you don't know what those jeans to do me
Make me wanna get down on one knee
You got that thunder, and it only makes me wonder
How it feels, to get up in those jeans (those {C'mon} jeans)

Lookin good, plenty time
ooo (is there room?) any more room for me... (any more room?)
