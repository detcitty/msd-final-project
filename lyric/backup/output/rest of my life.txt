If you live for something
You're not
Alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and
Lift your lighter
And toast to life
Luda!
They say what don't kill me
Can make me stronger
So two drinks a night
Should help me live longer
I blow some smoke
Just to give my lungs a test
Cause why tip-toe through life
To arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey
Yeah, I'm on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes
