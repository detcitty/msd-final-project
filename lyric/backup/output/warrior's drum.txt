[Intro]
Can I get the phat intro?
This is how you was gon start it off?
Yeah, knowhatimsayin?
This is the God, the Drunken Monk, King Just
Comin thru for the Shaolin crew
Black Fist, yo hit 'em wit a uppercut

[Chorus]
Heya heya heya, huh
Heya heya heya, huh
Heya heya heya, huh
Heya heya heya, huh

[King Just]
Heya heya, can I get some?
The sounds of the Warrior's Drum
On the warpath, don't make me laugh
Cuz you never in your life, wanna ever see the God's wrath
I'mma chief that smoke weed outta peace pipes
Yo, bro, I'm half Indian, so you're right
I'mma about to show you wit my mic sword
Yo Shaolin sling, come on raise the sword
Charge, they all crowd from the Black Fist
I got fudge in my mouth, they say that'll let your own wrist
M.C.'s fall and they can't get up
I do the rap, why, yes that's a cut
Huh, right back at you, niggas better run
Or feel the force of the Hell Razah's gun
Gupao, gupao, my style is wild chopped in the Shao'
Zoo, aow, aow, I can flip it acapello
I'll make you jelly like Jell-O, figaro, figaro
