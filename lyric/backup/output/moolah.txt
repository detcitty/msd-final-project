All my life I hustled just to get that Moolah
And stack my chains up, I'm gon' see the jewelrer
Standin' in the kitchen I whip out that work All I ever had was the cocaine
My cousin leaned out with the do' man
And GT switchin' four lanes
From the store with the coca like propane
On the block where the shots go "bang!"
Only real niggas really gon' hang
