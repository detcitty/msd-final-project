That's right, pleased to meet you
I still won't tell you my name
Don't you believe in mystery
Don't you want to play my game
I'm lookin for a man to love me
Like I never been loved before
I'm lookin for a man that'll do it anywhere
Even on a limousine floor
'Cause tonight i'm livin' in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
Do you think I'm a nasty girl
Tonight, I'm livin' in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you want to come with me
Do you think I'm a nasty girl
I guess I'm just use to sailors
I think they got water on the brain
I think they got more water upstairs
Than they got sugar on a candy cane
That's right, it's been a long time
Since I had a man that did it real good
If you ain't scared, take it out
I'll do it like a real live nasty girl should
Tonight I'm livin in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don't you want to come with me
Do you think I'm a nasty girl
