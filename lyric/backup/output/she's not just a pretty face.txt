Oh, na, na, na, na

She hosts a TV show
She rides the rodeo
She plays the bass in a band

She's an astronaut
A valet at the parking lot
A farmer working the land

She is a champion
She gets the gold
She's a ballerina
The star of the show

She's not
Just a pretty face
She's got
Everything it takes

She has a fashion line
A journalist for "Time"
Coaches a football team
