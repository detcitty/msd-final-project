When I saw you standing there
I asked myself, "Is she the kind who play's it fair"
I shouldn't let that bother me no more
Not this playboy who's felt the pain of love before

But how was I to know this feeling
Comin' on would be so strong
It's not turning out the way I planned
Hey, it's all wrong, but you make me wanna

Give you more than you bargained for, girl
And I've just begun to love you
I don't want no other to be my lover
And I've just begun to love you

I never been hooked so easily
Though I tried to stop, I couldn't stop what had to be
You say your old boyfriend let you down
And now he calls, well, baby, you belong to me
