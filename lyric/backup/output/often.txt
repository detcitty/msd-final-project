I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the Devil 'til I go nauseous

She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
