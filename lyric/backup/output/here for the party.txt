Well I'm an eight ball shooting, double fisted drinking son of a gun
I wear my jeans a little tight just to watch the little boys come undone

I'm here for the beer and the ball busting band
Gonna get a little crazy just because I can

You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leavin' till they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun, gonna get me some
