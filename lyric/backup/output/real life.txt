Well I grew up in a real town
Where the prom queen had a plastic crown
And we really did just drive around
â€˜Cause there wasn't sh! t to do
We didn't know we were real broke
Daddy rolled them real smokes
We drank RC, no real Coke
But our neighbor had a pool

We got green grass and two trees
Whoa oh oh oh oh
But it ain't like what's on TV
