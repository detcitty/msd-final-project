I don't ask for too many things
Only one thing I really need
That is you baby next to me
With that I'm satisfied
Don't need diamonds
I don't need gold
I just need someone here to hold
To keep me warm when the nights are cold
That would do just fine, just fine

You don't have to promise me the stars
Just promise me love, inside your heart
And that's enough
Baby that's enough

(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all of you
(Give me night)
All my nights spent just holding you
(Give me day)
All my days being close to you
Nothing else that I need
(Give me you)
Give me you, give me all your love
