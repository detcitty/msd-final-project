Wake your punk ass up for the 93 shot
MC Eiht's in the motherfuckin house. gyeah
And it ain't nothin but a compton thang y'all
And we ain't nuttin but niggaz on the run
And this goes out to my niggaz. gyeah

A fucked up childhood, is why the way I am
It's got me in the state where I don't give a damn, hmm
Somebody help me, but nah they don't hear me though
I guess I'll be another victim of the ghetto
Ain't no escapin, cause I'm way too young
Pops is dealin, and on top of that got moms sprung
Scheamin off the top, pops never figured
That he'd go down by the hands of another nigga
Now my pops is gone and that ain't no good
Got to follow in the foot steps of the homies from the hood
And where's the role model?
Niggaz putting brew in my fuckin baby bottle!
Damn, and through all the motherfuckin pain
They done drove my moms in-sane
So I guess I gotta do work so I ain't finished
