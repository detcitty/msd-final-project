And I'll be the train
That keeps on rollin'
Up up around the bend
I'll be the voice that you hear callin'
Howlin' on the wind
I'll be the river deep
Runnin' through your sleep
And I'll be the hand
That keeps on a-knockin'
Up up against your door
I'll be the promise never broken
O forever more
Every vow I make
O I won't forsake
Chorus:
'Cause I'm gonna be
The keeper of the flame
You won't forget my name
Long as our love is in the rain
Wait and see I'm gonna be
The keeper of the flame
Someday you'll know my name
