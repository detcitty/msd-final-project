I want to show you the picture I drew
When I was on the phone talking to you
I made a heart and I colored it red
'Cause I want you here on my side of the bed
I've been dreaming since I was born

And in my dreams, I see eyes like yours
I'll be the pillow where you lay your head, lay your head

If you'll come and sleep on my side of the bed
Lay down
The sheets are white like the moon, my love
Dream with me in my room
Lay down

- Instrumental -
Lay down
The sheets are white like the moon, my love
Dream with me in my room
