We got it
We got it

I'm given you all my time
Just come and feel the flavor
Whether it's rain or shine
'Cause we got it

I'm given you all my time
Just come and feel the flavor
Whether it's rain or shine
'Cause we got it

Thinkin' of you is all I do
Daydreamin' about my boo
Crazy days, I like your silly ways
Just thinkin' 'bout you what can I do

I'm given you all my time
Just come and feel the flavor
Whether it's rain or shine
'Cause we got it

I'm given you all my time
