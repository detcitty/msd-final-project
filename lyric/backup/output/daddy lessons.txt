Came into this world
Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Daddy made me dance
Daddy held my hand
But daddy liked his whisky with his tea

And we rolled motorcycles
Black jack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
And, oh, and that's when he gave to me

With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
