The way you wine and the way you dance

And the way that you twist and turn your waist
Leaves me wanting, leaves me yearning
Leaves me feeling for a taste
Before the end of the night

I wanna hold you so tight
You know I want you so much
And I'm so tempted to touch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch

Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch

Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch
To all the ladies in the dance

I don't even know your name
Little woman, I don't even know your age
