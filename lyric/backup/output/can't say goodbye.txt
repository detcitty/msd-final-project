Ever since the day we met
I knew that I would not regret
I could never leave you for another

But you treat me like a fool
I can't keep on being cool
Now I need some time just to recover

With a ticket to a distant place
I could leave you far behind
Your love has put me into outer space
I'm about to lose my mind

There are things about you
I will never understand
