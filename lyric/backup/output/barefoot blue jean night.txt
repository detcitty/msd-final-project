A full moon shinin' bright
Edge of the water, we were feelin' alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold

Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad him up good
Girls smile when we roll by

They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

(Whoa-oh)
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
