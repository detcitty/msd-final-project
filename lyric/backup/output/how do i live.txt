How do I
Get through one night without you
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be
Oh, I
I need you in my arms, need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul
If you ever leave
Well baby, you would take away everything good in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive
How do I
