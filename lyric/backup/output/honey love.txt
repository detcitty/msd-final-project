Yeah come inside
Now turn the lights down
Don't be scared, touch me
I know what you want and uh
Tonight is your night
For the rest of your life
So just lay back relax and listen

There's something in your eyes baby
It's telling me you want me baby
Tonight is your night
See you don't have to ask for nothin'
I'll give you everything you need
So girl don't be shy
Oh just

Baby, come inside
Turn down the lights
