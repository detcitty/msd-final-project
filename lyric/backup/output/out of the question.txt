One minute you say you will
And the next you won't
One minute you want me
And the next you don't
You're turning me upside down
Giving me the run around
Don't think that I don't know
I do
Don't think that I won't go
You watch me
It isn't out of the question

One minute you're kissing me
And the next you're not
One minute you remember
