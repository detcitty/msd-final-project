All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over
No gettin over'
There's just no getting over you.

Wish I could spin my world into reverse, just to have you back again
There's no getting over
There's no gettin over
There's just no getting over you (you)!

We're back
Hey hey I cant forget you baby
I think about you everyday
