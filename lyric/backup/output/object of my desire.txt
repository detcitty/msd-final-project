You glanced away, i lost all control
Anxiety had taken hold
My body quivers, hot flashes ignited in me, ooh, ooh, ooh
Gazing deep into my eyes
You spoke these words, i was hypnotized
Let me share a night in your fantasy, ooh, ooh

Turn on emotions so strong
Passion's fire burns on and on
My body screams, please make love to me,

Chorus:
Cause you're the object of my desire
Baby ignite my fire
Object of my desire
Hey you really turn me on

You're the object of my desire
Baby ignite my fire
