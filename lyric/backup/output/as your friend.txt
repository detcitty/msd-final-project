I just can't live anymore like this
My heart just opened up the door again
Just watch me fly as I spread my wings
Don't ask me why 'cause there are too many things.

And now we're standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
It used to be old me but today
I woke up as your friend

As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
...
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
...

Oh lil' mama, I can feel your fire
...
