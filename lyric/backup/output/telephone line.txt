Hello, how are you
Have you been all right
Through all those lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights
That's what I'd say
I'd tell you everything
If you'd pick up that telephone
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, how're you feeling
Are you still the same
Don't you realise the things we did, we did, were all for real
Not a dream
I just can't believe
They've all faded out of view
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooooh
