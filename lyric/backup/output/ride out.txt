Came in at first, had bad luck
Got a whole lot, remember I ain't had none
We done sold now everybody mad at me
Tell 'em roll down now everybody smashin'
Keep ready cause you know we bout to be a problem
Hope you ready cause you know it bout to be a problem

It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gone ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Takeover the street, that's how we roll
And we gone ride on forever

We ride out together

Fancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway
Cash in the driver door, spend it, do it my way
I fucks you like a matador, fresh out the catalogue
One fall we all fall, crew like dominos
But chasing after, all my dogs riding smoke
Pump heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold
We are not alone, broad better check your tone
You gon' need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans
Sit with us, table last supper
Toast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers
Yea, ain't nothin' but pure luxury
