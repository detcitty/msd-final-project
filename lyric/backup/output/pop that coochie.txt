Blowfly:
"Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-od-DAMN! Shee-yee-YIT! Look at the ass
on that bitch! Look at the titties!"

(Mixx scratches "Aw hit me!" and "Hold your legs up on easy.")

 Verse 1
[FKI] There's only one place where we can go
To see freaky hoes doin' shows
Doin' tricks to make us holler
On a giving night, all for a dollar
Silicone breasts, all on their chests
Nothin' like others, but above the rest
They'll do anything to turn us on
Them hoes got it goin' on!
[BM] I like big booty and big ol' titties
Bitch, you know you've been fucked by many
So come and be my private dancer
I got some money if that's the answer
I really wanna be with you;
I get hard after seeing you
