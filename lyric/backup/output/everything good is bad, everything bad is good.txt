[CHORUS]
Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good
Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good

Your love is like the sweet
Forbidden fruit in life
I'm another woman's man
You're another man's wife

We both know the difference
Between right and wrong
Life is full of temptation
It's so hard to be strong

[Repeat CHORUS]

Doo doo doo doo...
