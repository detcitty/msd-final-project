He wore that cowboy hat to cover up his horns
Sweet-talkin' forked tongue had a temptin' charm
Before I turned around, that girl was gone
All I can say is, "Bartender, pour me somethin' strong"

Here's to the past, they can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl, who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
