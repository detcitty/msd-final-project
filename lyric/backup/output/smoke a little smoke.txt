Turn the quiet up, turn the noise down
Let this ol' world just spin around
I wanna feel it swing, wanna feel it sway
And put some feel good in my soul
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Want a little more right and a little less left
Little more right now, a little less what's next
Act like tomorrow's ten years away
