I love the story in your love song
Building them castles in your mind
Come down here looking for a feeling
Someday I know you're gonna find

I wanna lay down there beside you
But first we ought to take some time
Before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind

I wanna feel good just like you do
(Feel good) I haven't
Loved in quite some time
(Feel good) I had some
Phases that I been through
