Can't believe that you think it's best that we part
We had good times but understood from the start
Time alone won't decide our fate
And now you're leaving, it's much too hard to take
Won't you give love a second chance?

'Cause no one can love you more than me
No one can feel your every need
No one can love the way that I do
No one can give like I give to you
