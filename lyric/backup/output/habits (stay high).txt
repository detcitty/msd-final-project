Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, ain't got no end
Staying in my play pretend

Where the fun, ain't got no end
Ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Ooh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, ain't got no end
Ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
