Say Foxx?
(Yeah?)
I had, I had a chick man and
(Yeah?)
She went and did me real wrong, I mean
(Yeah?)
I did the same thing to her but
She ain't have no right to do me
Like that though dawg, for real
(Yeah?)

You, been seeing him, and I know
And I was with her, and you knew about it
But I was too blind to see it baby
And you was out here doing
The same thing as me

I wanna ask, has he been by the crib?
Has he been in our, car?
And did you let him, drive?
Cause she's been by the house
She's been in the car
I've even let her push the
Porsche around a couple times

Ohh, we were so the same
I don't know why I can't see it baby
And it ain't a point to feeling blue
You're just like me and I'm just like you

You're just like me
Shorty all up in the club
Popping bottles of that bub
Giving all them dudes hugs

And you just like me
She don't know how to act
On the floor back in the back
Man I can't be mad
