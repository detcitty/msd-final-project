Friday night and the moon is high
I'm wide-awake just watchin' you sleep
And I promise you you're gonna have
More than just the things that you need

We ain't got much now
We're just startin' out
But I know somehow
Paradise is comin'

Someday baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
And good luck's gonna shine

Someday baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life

Oh now there's a place for you and me
Where we can dream as big as the sky
