Losers and winners
Everyone must play fair
All you beginners know
That you've got to start somewhere

(So) Whether you're saints or sinners
(Smile) Smile and share
(Sun) Sunlight as well as shadows
While you learn that everyone cares (Everyone cares)
Everyone out there (Everyone out there)
Has a cross to bear (Has a cross to bear)
And we'll never dare to live alone

'Cause we're not stones rolling down a mountainside
