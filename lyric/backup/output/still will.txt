Oh, don't even look at me wrong
When I come through the hood
Ain't nothin' changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block, I still will kill

And I don't want, nigga, but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin' around
If niggas get to fuckin' around

Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me if you can catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line, a nigga get clapped

I got an arsenal, a infantry, I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what'cha friends'll do

I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler & Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playin'
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain

Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit' words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time, yeah
