Whoo!
It sure is hot out here
Ya know?
I don't mind though
Just glad to be free
Know what I'm saying, uh!

Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
(What'cha wanna do?)
I just wanna praise You
(Yeah, yeah)

You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands
(Uh feel me?)
And I'm gonna praise You
(What'cha gon do?)
I'm gonna praise You

In the corners of mind
I just can't seem to find a reason to believe
That I can break free
'Cause you see I have been down for so long
