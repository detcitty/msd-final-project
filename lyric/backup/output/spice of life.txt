Down on the corner there's a reason to smile
When those evenin' shadows fall
Some kinda feelin' that it's hard to deny
Once the neon lights start to call

People out there searchin' for action
Daytime distraction slippin' right on by

Tonight, let's taste the spice of life
Keep it sweet until the mornin' light
Watch fantasy unfold
And let the lovin' flow

Caught in the madness of a summer romance
