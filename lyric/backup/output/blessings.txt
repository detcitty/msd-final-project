Blessings
Look, I feel blessed
Way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed (I)
(Straight up, look)

I live the life I deserve, bless
Fucken a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd
And Eddy, who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog", that shit get get petty
Bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back, is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three
Man this why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
