Never would have made it
Never could have made it without You
I would have lost it all
But now I see how You were there for me

And I can say
Never would have made it
Never could have made it
Without You

I would have lost it all
But I now I see
How You were there for me
And I can say

I'm stronger, I'm wiser
I'm better, much better

When I look back
Over all You brought me through
I can see that You were the One
I held on to

And I never, never would have made it
(Never would have made it)
Oh, I never could have made it
(Never could have made it without You)

Oh, I would have lost it all
Oh, but now I see
How You were there for me

I never
(Never would have made it)
No, I never
(Never could have made it without You)

I would've lost my mind
A long time ago
If it had not been for You
I'm

I am stronger
(I am stronger
I am wiser
(I am wiser)

And now I am better
(I am better)
So much better
