Lost in the high street, where the dogs run
roaming suburban boys
Mother's got her hairdo to be done

She says they're too old for toys
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen
in this suburban hell
and in the distance a police car
to break the suburban spell
Let's take a ride
and run with the dogs tonight
in suburbia
