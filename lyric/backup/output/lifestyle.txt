I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga living life like volcano and this only the beginning
I'm on the top of the mountain, puffing on clouds and niggas still beginning

Million 5 on the Visa card
Hundred bands still look like the fucking tires
Nigga serving great white like I'm feeding sharks
I won't do nothing with the bitch, she can't even get me hard
Something wrong with the pussy
Even though I ain't gong hit it, I'ma still make sure that she douche it
Me and my woadie, we don't get caught up like that, no way
We ain't got time to go see doctors, J
(Who said money?)
Hop up in my bed full of forty bitches and yawning
Hey, this a show bitch you performing
I do this shit for my daughters and all my sons, bitch
Im a run up them bands, I'll take out their funds, bitch
I got a moms bitch, she got a moms bitch
I got sisters and brothers to feed
