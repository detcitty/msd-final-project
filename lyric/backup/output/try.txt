Ever wonder 'bout what he's doin'
How it all turned to lies
Sometimes I think that it's better

To never ask why
Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns

Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
