Seven days of Saturday
Is all that I need
Got no use for Sunday
'Cause I don't rest in peace
I don't need no Mondays

Or the rest of the week
I spend a lot of time in bed

But baby I don't like to sleep no

I won't lie to you
I'm never gonna cry to you
I'll probably drive you wild 8 days a week
Until I'm six feet under
Baby I don't need a bed
Gonna live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead

Till they roll me over
And lay my bones to rest

Gonna live while I'm alive
I'll sleep when I'm dead
{Alright listen up}
