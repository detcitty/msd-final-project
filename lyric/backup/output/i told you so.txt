You said you needed your space
Oh, I wasn't where you wanted to be
I didn't stand in your way
I only want you to be happy

And so how surprised am I
To see you here tonight

Well, can't you see
That for worse or for better we're better together?
Please just come back home
No, don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
