You're the one, now, I know it
In time, I'm gonna show you
Day by day, I pick myself up
All alone and waiting for you

Take the key, set your heart free
I've got the luck and soul, too

Test of time, it's just a test of time
I can stand the test of time
Test of time, I'll make believe that you're mine
