Whoo!

Let you take me out.
I know what you are all about,
But when I did, I wasn't trying to lead you on.
Now you bring me home and tell me "good night's not enough for you".
I'm sorry, baby, I didn't mean to turn you on.
You read me wrong.
I wasn't trying to lead you on not like you did.
I didn't mean to turn you on.
You read me wrong. (You read me wrong.)
I wasn't trying to lead you on.
I want a friend.
I didn't mean to turn you on.
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on.

I know you expecting a one-night stand.
When I refused, I knew you wouldn't understand.
I told you twice, I was only trying to be nice.
Only trying to be nice. Oh.
I didn't mean to turn you on.
