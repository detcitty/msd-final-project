I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain't nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge, I won't back down
Cause it's time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family, family, family, fam, fam, family

Five, four, three, two, I got one shot
you lose the love and respect thats were the trust stop
New work, top drop
I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop
And you can smell just how I'm smokin' when I burn out
And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not
It's love and loyalty until my heart lock
Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out
I said it once, I'll do it again
I'm playin' the game, I do it to win
With you and your friend, that's thick and thin
That's me and my team, you know we gon' win
