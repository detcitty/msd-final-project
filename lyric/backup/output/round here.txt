Hammerin' a nail
Stackin' them bales
I'm dog tired by the 5 o'clock hour
But I'm ready to raise some hell
And Jesse's gettin' ready
I'm gassin' up the Chevy
I'm gonna pick her up at 6
I hope she's gonna wear the jeans with a tear
That her mama never fixed

The moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
