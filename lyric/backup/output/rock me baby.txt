You may call me a rolling stone
I'm a freeborn man and I stand alone
Come looking for a little satisfaction

I don't drive no Cadillac
All I got's hangin' on my back
But I do believe in a physical attraction

I can warm your coldest night
I'll make everything alright, c'mon

Ooh, rock me, baby
Let me feel the beat
I said, ooh, rock me, baby
Right down to my feet

I said, ooh, rock me, baby
Hold me, oh so tight
I said, ooh, rock me, baby
Rock me through the night

You better hold me while you can
You're gonna lose your midnight man
Now come on and rock me, rock me
