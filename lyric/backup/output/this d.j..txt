Intro/chorus: warren g

It's kind of easy when you're listening to the g-dub sound
Pioneer speakers bumpin as i smoke on a pound
I got the sound fo yo' ass and it's easy to see
*singing* that this d.j. be warren g

Verse one: warren g

Can i get in where i fit in? sit in, listen (uh-huh)
Let me conversate better yet regulate
Shake the spot with my knot, may fade
Cause i don't like to dream about gettin paid
I played ball through the halls, of c-i-s
With snoop dogg's big brother, call him dirty left
