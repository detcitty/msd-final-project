Making love in the rain,
i can't believe the joy it brings me.
Making love all alone,
i hear the rain on my window.
It's just a little thing,
but it means so much to me.
Our bodies together,
while the rain plays a melody.
Every raindrop makes think of you.
(wishing you were close to me)
There is nothing that i'd rather do than...
making love in the rain,
i can't believe the joy it brings me.
When we're done - all alone,
