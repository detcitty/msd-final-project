Let's chill
(Ho, ho, baby, hey... hey... ya.)
Let's chill
(Let's chill, baby)

From the first time I saw your face
Girl I knew I had to have you
I wanted to wrap you with my warm embrace
Visions of your lovely face

All my love is for you
Whatever you want I will do
You're the only one I want in my life
For you I'll make that sacrifice, ho

Let's chill
And Let's settle down (and That's what I want)
And That's what I wanna do (Just me and you)
Just me and you (Baby)
