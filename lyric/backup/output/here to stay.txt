This, taking it away, I've got a problem
With me getting in the way, not by design
So I take my face and bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain, bleed, bleed.
This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked-up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far

All this time I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking
I'm done, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and
Oh I cannot give anymore.
My mind's done with this
Okay, I've got a question.

Can I throw it all away?
