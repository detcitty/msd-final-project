Sometimes when
A woman's with men
She loses control
Of her body and mind
She tries to hold her on
To the ones that she loves
But nothing can hold back
The love desire

When we met
I thought you were cute
And obviously
You knew you were fine
Your elegance
Just filled the air
I tried to hate you
But I didn't have time

You know that you're always on my mind
I just can't control the way I feel about you
You're making me crazier day by day
This desire for love
(Ooh ah love desire) Love desire
(Ooh ah love desire) Love desire
(Ooh ah love desire) Love desire
