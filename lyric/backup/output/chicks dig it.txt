Hey y'all, watch this

Daddy's belt, momma's drapes
Standin' tall on the backyard shed
Lookin' cool in my Superman cape
I told the neighborhood girls
Said, Hey y'all watch this
My fate was a broken arm
My reward was one big kiss
When Daddy asked me why I did it
I made him laugh out loud when I told him
'Cause the chicks dig it.

Scars heal, glory fades
And all we're left with are the memories made, oh yea.
