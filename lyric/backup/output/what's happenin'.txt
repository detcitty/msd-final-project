(Verse One - Trick Daddy)
Half step pussy ass nigga
Why you lookin' at a nigga like you wanna run one wit' me?
I got my big gun wit' me don't feel like doofin' I feel like shootin' FOOL!
And I don't like your atitude
You do shit that dem hoes on a rag'll do
Ol' faggot, you better watch your mouth
Fo' I be in front yo' house, when yo' ass come out
Ol' bitch ass, hold another nigga dick ass, BITCH ASS, NIGGA!
Keep lookin' at a nigga like you gonna tell somethin'
I'll fuck around and, kill ya!
So now that you set you ready, YO!
If this shit get silly I'm lettin' it go
First scrito in the front seat
You ever come my way, it's gon' be gunplay
HEEEYYY. I ride wit' a AK, get high and spit five out the AK
Ok, let a nigga play and watch T-Double-D knock ya ass of the free seat
All my Dade County Chevy boys, who drive candy toys and tolt guns galore
