Ooh, crazy's what they think about me
Ain't gonna stop cause they tell me so
Cause 99 miles per hour baby
Is how fast that I like to go.

Can't keep up with my rhythm
Though they keep trying.
Too quick for the lines they throw.
I walk to the sound of my own drum
it goes, they go, we go, hey yeah yeah yeah

Oh, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really need it, need it, so go
