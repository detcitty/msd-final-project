It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's DARE
It's DARE

You've got to press it on you

You just think it
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, DARE
Jump with them all and move it

Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out
