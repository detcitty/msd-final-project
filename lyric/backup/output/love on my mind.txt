Boy, I can't wait to get you alone
Inside my house
'Cause baby it's you and only you
That I keep on thinking about

I know what you want it
How good my love could be
Tonight you will get the answer
I'll satisfy your curiosity

Take me away in ecstasy
I want to know how it feels to be loved
Boy, take your time because I have all night
I'm gonna show you what I'm been thinking of

I've got love on my mind
I knew it's the way to make things right
I think it's about that time
