If you want it, you can have it, that's what you say
But I don't want the things that you leave behind
Take the pictures, take the windows and the walls
Baby, won't you leave me my peace of mind
Oh, such a waste of time
Oh, such a waste
I still want you, baby

(Heaven help me)
Heaven help me
(Talk to strangers)
Talk to strangers
(Heaven help me over you)
Help me over you
(I can't seem to take these changes)
Everything reminds my heart of you

Thought the first time was the last time
Would be forever
Now I find I'm having to search again
It'll happen, it's gotta happen, come together
I just wish somebody would tell me when
Oh, such a waste of time
Oh, such a waste
