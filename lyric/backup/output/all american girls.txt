We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

The day has finally come
We're reaching out for number one
We've worked hard all of our lives
It's a fight just to survive

You'd better get this straight
Wise up before it's too late
