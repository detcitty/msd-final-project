It's probably what's best for you
I only want the best for you
And if I'm not the best, then you're stuck
I try to sever ties and I
Ended up with wounds to bind

Like you're pouring salt in my cuts
And I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can't bandage the damage

You never really can fix a heart
Even though I know what's wrong
