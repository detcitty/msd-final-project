You wake up in the morning and another night's gone.
You tumble out of bed and turn the radio on,
But you just can't think about the day to come
Cause you're thinking about them high school nights.

Making all the moves, gotta do it in style.
It merely makes the high school day worthwhile.
When the work piles high
And the day drags by
And you never see the end in sight.

I remember those, high school nights.
We had it made them, high school nights.
