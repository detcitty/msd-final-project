Ja Rule, Chuck B-more
Every thug needs a lady
And every thug needs a down ass bitch, huh, feel me
Every thug needs a lady
Baby I'm convinced, you my down ass bitch
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd lie for me, like you lovin me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd die for me, like you cry for me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
If you'd kill for me, like you comfort me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
Girl I'm convinced, you're my down ass bitch
Uh
I know that you're lovin me, 'cause you thug with me, who bust slugs for me?
My baby
Who gon' kill for you, like I comfort you, who else but the Rule?
You feel me
Girl when we connect the dots we hit the spot
Twin Benz's, you ride hard, I ride drop
And to make it better, baby got the nina' Beretta tucked low
And I'm two cars back with the four-four
And it freaks you out, on your momma's couch, that's what us thugs be 'bout
You know me
And when I pray for love, baby pray for us, who celebrates the thugs?
My lady
Got me seekin capital game when I spit sixteen
Whether bars or sixteens in the doors of cars
A star is born
In the hood, made a name live on, R-U-L-E, ladies, feel me
Baby say yeah, (baby say yeah)
