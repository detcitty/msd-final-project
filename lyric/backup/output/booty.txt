Big, big booty
What you got a big booty (uh)
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty (it's Iggy Iggs)
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty (go to work)
Big, big booty
What youâ€¦ (aw)
(Ain't that a freak)

Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
(Ain't that a freak)

Have you seen her on the dance floor?
She got the boom, shake the room
That's the lightning and the thunder
You wanna meet her, you wanna touch her
See the light in her eyes
And it starts to make you wonder

All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man
Bring him to the dance floor
Go on, let them jeans touch while you're dancing
It's his birthday
Give him what he ask for
(Let me show you how to do it)
