Every time I go to the movies
All I see is happy love on the silver screen
Everywhere I go, I see men and women lovin'
Kissin' and a huggin', enjoyin' life

Oh, what's the matter with me, am I lonely?
Is there anybody out there who feels the same?
Every time I turn on my TV
I see somebody lovin' somebody

Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?
Are you getting enough happiness?
Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?
