Used to play the Cassanova
Smoother than the Bossa Nova
Love to play the Romeo
But I never need a home to go to

I'm so greasy, I'm so slick
I leave no traces, I just get out quick
I use cheap champagne
Brief affairs and backstage love

But a love like this is much too good
To ever throwaway
A love like this is much too good
To ever throwaway
