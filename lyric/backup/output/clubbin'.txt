Wooh, Come on
Its the Piper
Marques.

You know we be
Up in the club
Where we do things like
Throw our hands up
All kinds of drinks are
Off in the cups
All of my thugs
Honies show me love
DJ playin the cuts

I'm dancin with a nice honey
And her friend
One on the back and one on the front
Shakin it up, shakin it up
Mami dont break it
Takin it down, taking it down
I love the way you snake it
You got the best of me
Doing what you're doing
Up in the VIP
Doing what you're doing
Girl i'm about to buy you anything you want
Get you in the coup
And take your pretty ass home
Last call for alcohol
You know how we do, yeah

You know we be up in the club like.

You know we be
Up in the club
Where we do things like
Throw our hands up
All kinds of drinks are (All kinds of drinks are up in the club)
Off in the cups
All of my thugs
Honies show me love
DJ playin the cuts (Yeah, yeah yeah)

You know we be up in the club like.
