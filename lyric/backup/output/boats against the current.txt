Outside we're lonely but we are free
We're misfits, rebels, we're creeps and freaks
How come they've got it figured out
Well we're lost, waiting to be found
Maybe we need something different now
For every broken bone and every lie you've told
Every time you're lost and you can't find hope
This is for the ones who always feel alone

We are outsiders
Living inside a broken world
We are outsiders
And I know sometimes it can hurt
