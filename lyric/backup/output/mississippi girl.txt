Yeah,
Well, it's a long way from Starr, Mississippi
to the big stage I'm singin' on tonight
and sometimes the butterflies still get me
when I'm in the spotlight
and some people seem to think that I've changed
that I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
that I've really always been
Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
just cause everyone knows her name,
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
