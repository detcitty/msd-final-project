Hey, Virginia
I know it'll come out right
When I look into your eyes
It's something in you
Doing it to me

My knees start to shake
My hands start to perspirate
Every time that you say wait
Lord, I think my belt will break

Virginia, touch me like you do
Touch me like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do, like you do
Like you do, aw, yeah
