You're a crack-of-dawn, Monday-morning, coffee strong
Poured everything you got into a paycheck Friday night

You're a plow with stroke diesel, backhoe-riding king of beers, 18-wheeler
Driving, living life in between the lines
Of clocking in and quitting time
But then the six-string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd

When the lights come on, and everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to a girl to take it home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
