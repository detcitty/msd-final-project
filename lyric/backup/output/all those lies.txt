I woke up shakin' in a cold, cold sweat
I got so much goin' on. What did I forget?
I know there's somethin', but it got so late
I need someone to help me get my story straight
Who told shorty? Who told you?
And who else knows about the things I do?
It's my own bus'ness. It's my own fun
So don't you breathe a word of this to anyone
