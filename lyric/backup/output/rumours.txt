How do rumours get started they're started by jealous people and
they get mad seeing something they had and somebody else is holding
they tell me that temptation is very hard to resist
these wicked women ooh they just persist
maybe you think it's cute but girl I'm not impressed
I tell you one time only with my business please don't mess
When you look at all these rumours surrounding me every day
I just need some time some time to get away from
from all these rumours I can't take it no more
my best friend said there's one out now 'bout me and the girl next door
Hear that one about Tina some say she's much too lose
that came straight from a guy who claims he's tasting her juice
did you hear that one about Michael some say he must be gay
I try to argue but they said if he was straight he wouldn't move that way
