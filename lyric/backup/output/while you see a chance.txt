(Steve Winwood/Will Jennings)

Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see
What can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free
Can you be

When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you

While you see a chance
Take it
Find romance
Fake it
Because it's all on you

Don't you know by now
