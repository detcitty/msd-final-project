Wild kind of look to the day
Opening eyes impale neon flickers
She moon she turning away
The city's her slave but he's cheating his mistress
She's moody and gray
She's mean and she's so restless (so restless)
All over you as they say
Rumours or rivals yell at the strike force
Hi guys, by the way
Are you aware you're being illegal
It's making your saviour behaviour look evil
'scuse my timing but say
How d'you fit in with this flim, flam and judy

Maximum big surprise
