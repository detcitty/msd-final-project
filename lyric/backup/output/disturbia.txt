Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (What's wrong with me?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Why do I feel like this?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (I'm going crazy now)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

No more gas, in the red
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
All my life on my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise
Your mind is in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
