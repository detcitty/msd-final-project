Somebody told me there'd be trouble at home
'Cause we never talk a lot when we spend time alone
So how are we supposed to know know when somethin' is wrong
Well, we've got a right to communicate it keeps a happy home
And no one does it like me and no that's sure
Has that kind of whip appeal on me
Keep on whippin' on me work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' me on me
Keep on whippin' on me baby work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin' on me
When we go to work how the day seems so long
