Out here nothin' changes
Not in a hurry anyway
You can feel the endlessness
With the comin' of the light o' day
You're talkin' 'bout a chosen place
You wanna sell it in a marketplace
Well
Well just a minute now

You're standin' on
Solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change
Are blowin' down the line

Right down the line
