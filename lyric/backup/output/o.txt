Pretty, pretty ass hoes in my room wearin' lingerie
'Bout to make a scene, puffin' green, sippin' chardonnay
Face down, ass up that's the way we like to uuh
Face down, ass up that's the way we like to fuck

You show me things I ain't heard of (heard of, heard of)
The way you poppin' it is like murder (the way you poppin' it is like murder)
The way you callin' me daddy (daddy, daddy)
