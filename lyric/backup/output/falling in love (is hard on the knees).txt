You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so bad
you're so bad you're so bad
You think you're in love
like it's a real sure thing
but every time you fall
you get your ass in a sling
you used to be strong
but now it's ooh baby please
'cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
We were making love when you told me that you loved me
i thought ol' cupid he was taking aim
i was believer when you told me that you loved me
and then you called me someone elses name
There ain't gonna be no more beggin' you please
you know what i want
and it ain't one of these
