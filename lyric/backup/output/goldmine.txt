Girl's got a goldmine and he's so fine
Girl's got a goldmine and he's all mine
Baby's got a goldmine, treats me so kind
Loves me rain or shine, my baby's divine

Flowers arrive, who else whould think of that but my guy
He's all heart and all mine
Ooh and I don't have to be Miss Perfect One
For him to love what he sees
And I can feel it in the little things he does
What I found is every woman's dream

My baby he's a goldmine
And ooh, what he does just keeps my heart in love, woah
My baby he's a goldmine
And ooh, all he does just keeps me here in love
