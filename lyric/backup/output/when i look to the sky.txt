When it rains it pours and opens doors
That flood the floors we thought would always
Keep us safe and dry

And in the midst of sailing ships
We sink our lips into the ones we love

That have to say goodbye
And as I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion

That won't seem to let me go
'Cause when I look to the sky
Something tells me you're here with me
