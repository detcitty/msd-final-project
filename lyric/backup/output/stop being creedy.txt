Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gonna bite you an' snatch the plate

I could flip that flow, I could stick that hoe
I can get that dough, you know I'm with that Jo
An' the thing about the shit I came through, I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin' dreams
All nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever
The closest thing to me is gonna get it

But, never will I, can I think death is wrong
So I'm a keep holdin' on till what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga bone
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin' mother fuckers, stay on the floor
Four, four, that's what I get sick wit'
Four more, now all this is liquid

Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real partner, give to the needy
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gonna bite you an' snatch the plate

Y'all been eatin' long enough, now stop bein' greedy
