Today's the day, we're out to play
And lost our way, it's always the same, oh baby now
Climbed the trees, swam the seven seas
We've grazed our knees and no-one's to blame

Come and sit beside us, we'll give you such a thrill
We're not nice we're cool as ice, we'll give you quite a chill
Let your imagination take over on this ride
Out of sight, all right, hold on tight
