All right
Get ready
We're gonna work that body

Reach 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Strech 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Push 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
(Up 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)

Every morning when we wake
To make up for that piece of cake
We ate last night
What do you do?
We do what's right, alright

Throw our hands up in the air
One foot here
And one foot there
We're so tight
That's alright, alright

Take a look girls
At these numbers
We're still improving
Got these bodies moving
Everybody's gonna hate you
There will be no doubt
Eat your heart out
