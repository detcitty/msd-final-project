My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
I did not come 2 funk around
Till I get your daughter, I won't leave this town
In the beginning (funky) God made the sea
But on the 7th day He made me
He was tryin' 2 rest y'all when He heard the sound
Sound like a guitar cold gettin' down
I tried 2 bust a high note, but I bust a string
My God was worried until he heard me sing

My name is Prince and I am funky
My name is Prince, the one and only
Hurt me!
(Do that, do that somebody) {x8}
Hurt me!

My name is Prince and I am funky
When it come 2 funk, I am a junkie
I know from righteous, I know from sin
I got 2 sides and they both friends
Don't try 2 clock 'em, they're much 2 fast
If U try 2 stop 'em, they'll kick that ass
Without a pistol, without a gun
When U hear my music, U be havin' fun
That's when I gotcha, that's when U mine
2 tell the truth, tell me what's my line?

My name is Prince and I am funky (U can't stop Prince)
My name is Prince, the one and only (U can't stop Prince)
