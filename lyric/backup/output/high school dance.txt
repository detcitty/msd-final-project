Remember back in high school
When you couldn't wait
For the very first dance
You lay your homework was the rule

And just thinkin' 'bout the music
Puts you in a trance
You never have to worry
If you save your lunch money

So you'll have the chance
To get your ticket in a hurry
For the high school dance

Dance to the beat of the band
We're gonna dance at the high school dance
Boogie to the beat of the band, ooh
Boogie to the high school dance

Dance to the beat of the band
We're gonna dance at the high school dance
