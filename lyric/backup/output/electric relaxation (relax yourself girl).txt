Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please settle down

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was workin' at the club you would not pay
Aiyyo, my man Phife, dig it, he got somethin' to say

I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-town

You got B.B.D. all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A pretty little somethin' on the New York Street
This is how I represent over this here beat, talkin 'bout you

Yo, I took you out
