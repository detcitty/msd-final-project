Since my baby left me,
Found a new place to dwell.
It was down at the Lonely Street,
At Heartbreak Hotel.
I get so lonely, baby, I get so lonely,
I get so lonely, I can die.

When I walk through that door, baby, be polite.
You're going to make me sore
If you don't treat me right.
Don't you ever kiss me once,
Kiss me twice,
Treat me nice.

Well, it's a one for the money,
Two for the show,
Three to get ready
