I know there`s a lotta talk going around today
About cigarette smoking whittling your life away
I`ve seen it and I`ve heard it so many times
That finally it just started to prey on my mind
I guess it scared me a little bit
That`s why I decided I was gonna quit
So while I was sitting here forming my battle plan
I took another puff and turned on the fan
I just sat there in my easy chair
And thought of all the money I`d wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I`d spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
Said to myself this ain`t gonna be so tough
With that little bit of assurance
I took another puff

I took a puff, a puff, then I ripped off another puff
I decided I`d about had about enough
That breaking this habit won`t be too tough
