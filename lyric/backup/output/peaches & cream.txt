(So hot, hot)
It's the S the L the I the M
Let me tell you what I wanna do
Let me show you that I'm feelin' you
Wanna sex, wanna ride with you
Wanna taste, wanna put my lips all over you
Can't get enough of you
Always thinking of you
So sweet, so very wet
So good, girl you make me sweat
Girl I'm talkin' 'bout

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine (Girl you taste so good to me)
It's even better when it's with ice cream (ooh)
Know what I mean, peaches and cream (ooh)

I never thought that I would be
So addicted to you
On top, underneath, on the side of you
Better yet baby inside of you
I love the way you're just flowing down
And I can feel it all around
In the front, in the back of you
Ooh I love the taste of you
Girl you know what I'm talking about

Peaches and cream
