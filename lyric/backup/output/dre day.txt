Yeah, hell yeah
Ha, know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah, Mista Busta, where the fuck ya at?
Can't scrap a lick, so I know ya got your gat
Your dick on hard, from fuckin' your road dogs
The hood you threw up with, niggaz you grew up with

Don't even respect your ass
That's why it's time for the doctor, to check your ass, nigga
Used to be my homey, used to be my ace
Now I wanna slap the taste out yo mouth

Nigga bow down to the row
Fuckin' me, now I'm fuckin' you, little hoe
Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide
Let me ride, just another homicide

Yeah, it's me so I'ma talk on
Stompin' on the Eazyest streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back cause you might get smoked, loc

And pass the bud, and stay low-key
B.G. 'cause you lost all your homey's love
Now call it what you want to
You fucked with me, now it's a must that I fuck wit you

Yeah, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about
We have your motherfuckin' record company surrounded
Put down the candy and let the little boy go
