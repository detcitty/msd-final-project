[Intro:]
Shoulda gone dancin'
(hey, sweet baby)
We... (I love you)
Instead of romancin' (and I always love you)
We... (I hope the things work out for us)
Shoulda gone dancin'
(and I think they should)
Shoulda gone dancin'
(but you and I both know
That it's too late to be good)

Mmm
I think that we should get away
We caught a flight on a train station
Say goodbye to good ole L.A.
Ah, to do some dancin' in the Frisco Bay
Leave reservations at the Holiday Inn
(it was late)
It was late, but we got in
We started kissing and holding me tight
Before I knew it, it was broad daylight

Shoulda gone dancin' (we shoulda gone dancin')
Instead of romancin' (ooh, lovin' and romancin)
We shoulda gone dancin'
Instead of romancin' my sweet baby, yeah
We shoulda gone dancin', yeah yeah
Instead of romancin', yeah yeah yeah
We shoulda gone dancin'
Instead of romancin', ooh ooh yeah, woh

Ha, I heard about San Francisco
It's got a lot of super discos
We went there to see just that and
We haven't gone in a instant yet
I may regret I would change in plans
But if I had the chance, I'll do it again
(do it again)

We shoulda gone dancin'
Instead of romancin'
We shoulda gone dancin', oh
Instead of romancin' my sweet baby, yeah
We shoulda gone dancin', yeah yeah
Instead of romancin', yeah yeah yeah
We shoulda gone dancin'
Instead of romancin', ooh ooh yeah, woh

Come on, oh oh oh oh oh
Well I gots to tell ya we shoulda
