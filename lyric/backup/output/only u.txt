Ooh
I can't wait to get next to you
Ooh
I just can't leave you alone

Boy you got me doing things that I would never do
And I can't stop the way I'm feeling if I wanted to
I'm crazy 'bout the way that you could make me say your name
And if I couldn't have you I would probably go insane

And only u can make me feel(only u can make me feel)
