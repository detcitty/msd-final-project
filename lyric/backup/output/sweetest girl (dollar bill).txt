Some live for the bill, some kill for the bill
Yeah, she wined for the bill, grind for the bill
(She used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
(She used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill
High school she was that girl, that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)

Never thought she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (Where my money at?)

She thought he'd call (Where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (Where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (Where my money at?)

She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard

All he wanna know is (Where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (Where my money at?)

See I'ma tell you, like you told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all
Dollar dollar bill y'all
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all
Dollar dollar bill y'all
'Cause I'ma tell you, like you told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all
