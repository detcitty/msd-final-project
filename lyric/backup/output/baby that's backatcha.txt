I put a song in your heart, so you say
Sing it out, let the world know what it's all about
If I make it possible for the impossible
To happen for you like you say, hey

Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's the same thing you do for me
Baby, that's backatcha
Oh, baby, that's tit for tat
I'm givin' you this for that
