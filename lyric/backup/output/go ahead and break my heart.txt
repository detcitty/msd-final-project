The sun is setting on your last good try
Here I am again with half a goodbye
Wonder if you're really gone this time
Just when i'm about to lose my mind
There you are again on my phone
The moon was rising and you're all alone
Maybe we could just hang a while
Maybe we can make each other smile
Oh no here I go

Why don't you go ahead and break my heart
Why are you waiting is it way too hard
