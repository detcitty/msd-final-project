Hey girl, what's up?
I know it's late, but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz but
That song came on and I just thought what harm could come from one little call?
I know you say you're taken, but I say girl you're taking too long

Tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl, it's just wasting precious time
