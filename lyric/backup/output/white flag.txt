I know you think that I shouldn't still love you
or tell you that.
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
where's the sense in that?
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder

Or return to where we were
But I will go down with this ship

And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
