Just about the time I think I've had it
Everything I've planned has fallen through
Just about the time the whole thing's crumblin' in
And I can't hold back no matter what I do
And just about the time I feel like screamin'
And findin' me a wall to punch right through
I look up and I just can't help smilin'
