When the lady smiles, you know it drives me wild
Her lips are warm and resourceful
When her fingertips, go drawing circles in the night
And the mood is soft and sensual, hu-u
And I love it, yeah I love it
It's the answer to all my dreams

Everytime it feels like the earth is shakin'
It doesn't matter, a glass is fallin', I hear it shatter
Maybe it's raining, faster and faster
