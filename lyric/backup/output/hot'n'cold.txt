You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch, I would know
And you over think
Always speak critically
I should know

That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot then you're cold

You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
