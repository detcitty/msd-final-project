(L. A. Martinee)
I've never know someone before
Who feels the way you do
All my dreams somehow became true with you
And i've never wanted someone more
As much as i want you
Love will last forever it's true with you
I will always fear
Awaking in the night
And not having you by my side
It's not a dream
We all need love and understanding
We must break thru
