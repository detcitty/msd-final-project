Do you wish to change your entry?
Very well, please enjoy your experience

I never thought that you would be the one
After all the things that we've been through
You gave your body to another in the name of fun
I hope you had some, baby, if not, boo hoo

It's so sad but I hate you like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate you 'cuz you're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate you, now everyday would be a waste of time
'Cuz I hate you

I never thought that I could feel this way
To fall in love was a table reserved for fools
Say you're sorry if you wanna but it's all in vain
I'm out the door sweet baby, that's right, we're through

It's so sad but I hate you like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate you 'cuz you're all that's ever on my mind
