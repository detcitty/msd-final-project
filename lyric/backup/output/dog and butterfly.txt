There I was, with the old man.
Stranded again. So off I'd ran.
A young world crashin' around me.
No possibilities of gettin' what I need.
He looked at me, and smiled.
Said 'No, no, no, no, no... child'

See the Dog and Butterfly. Up in the air, he liked to fly.
Dog and Butterfly... below she had to try.
But she rolled back down to the warm soft ground.
Laughing, she don't know why.
She don't know why. Dog and butterfly
