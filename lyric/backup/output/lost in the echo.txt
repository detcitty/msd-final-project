Yeah, yo.

You were that, foundation, never gonna be another one, no.
I followed, so taken, so conditioned I could never let go.
Then sorrow, then sickness, then the shock when you flip it on me.
So hollow, so vicious, so afraid I couldn't let myself see.
That I could never be held, back up, no, I'll hold myself.
