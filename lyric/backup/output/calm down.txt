Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up

(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout niggas!
Oh my Lord

Lower the casket down
Sprinkle the ash, you'll get your ass kicked, pow!
Frown while I shit on your crown, skip town
Ground zero appear on the king cash cow
Do I make 'em say 'Wow!', strip, ow, bow
I sit with the pound, click, pow
Blow, click, click, pow, click, pow
Stop traffic dropping them classics, flip now
Bitches I'm making them skip with thou
Art, you don't really want start when I growl
(rawr, rawr, rawr) let me come and mop up the knock offs
When I pop off I never stop, cause
When we do come through, you better lock doors (PAUSE)
The wolves wanna eat, be by they lockjaws
No need to cook up the coke, you see me chop raw
And if you ain't have enough
What in the fat fishes of a phenomenal Fahrvergnügen
Fuck is going on? Back with the beat and the raps is callous
Bang on another song, I'mma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling in wetness
And nibble them like sunflower seed shell
See these skills got my weight up heavy like three whales
And I shit on Ishmaels ‘til they're stinkin' foul and my weed smell
Talking, I'm sick and I got them shook banging on retail until they cripple
See I cook like I'm slanging a weed sale
And I triple gram and whoop ‘em and drag 'em like females (gasp)
Oh see well, these niggas already know the way that I fuck shit up, minus the details
The case is shut, your bitch remind me of my replacement but kind of an ancient slut
It's going down like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit like I'm sticking sticks in their gut
So gracefully, ungraciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas and attack them like apes in the cut
I'm waiting for the taking while I break niggas neck like a bracelet, fuck
