You don't touch me anymore
You never say the words I love you
You just sit behind your paper
The silence cuts me like a razor
I'm gonna leave you
Maybe someday soon
When I can give up this fight
But maybe not tonight

We don't talk much anymore
Not the same way we used to
Whenever I reach out to hold you
