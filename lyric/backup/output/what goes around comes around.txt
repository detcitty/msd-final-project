You came into my life and said you'd give me love
You promised I would never hurt again
I believed your words
I had trust in you
I was just a fool
Your love was never true
But no more tears will be shed from my eyes anymore
I know I'll be strong and you will be gone
These silly games will end
You'll never break my heart again
Tell him why girlfriend

Chorus:
'Cause what goes around, comes around
That's what people say
