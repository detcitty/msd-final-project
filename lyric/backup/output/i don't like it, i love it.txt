I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurts
I don't want it, I gotta, gotta have it, uh oh
When I can't find the word I just go
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it

All out, turn the beat up
Hey now I'm glad to meet ya
Turn up girl, blow the speaker
Yeah up, think about it now, blow the speaker
I'll speak louder, let's get wild tonight
Billionaire bottles, we just down em like
Ain't no problem, all my roads are right

All right, all right

I don't like it, I love it
I got another comin' in my budget
