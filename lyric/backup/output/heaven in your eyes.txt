Woh ooh woh
I can tell by the look in your eyes you've been hurtin'
You know I'll never let you down, oh no
And I'll try anythin' to keep it workin'
You gave me time to find out
What my heart was lookin' for
And what I'm feelin' inside

In your eyes
I wanna see your love again
In your eyes
I never want this feelin' to end
It took some time to find the light
