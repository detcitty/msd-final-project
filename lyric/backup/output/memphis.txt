Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis?
Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis?

I got to get away, study my geography
I'm just a shadow of the boy I used to be
I used to see the light, now it's all a mystery
I used to feel the beat, now I feel a million miles from...

Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis?
Memphis - Where the hell is Memphis?

I used dirty words never too excessively
But saying "rock'n'roll" never seemed so bad to me
