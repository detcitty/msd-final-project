I don't like to worry
About no one else
I like to be, you know alone and free
I'm happy by myself, yeah

But here comes this girl, whoa, yeah
I've seen 'em all around the world
She looks into me
Looks right through me

Don't you know it hit me like a hammer
Hit me like a ton of lead
You know it hit me like a hammer
