I'm not looking for a fantasy
All I want is reality and you
I'm not looking for a diamond ring
Not into material things
All I want is your love

I'll be there
Through the thick and rhin
Keeping my loving strong
It will go on and on
And on and on and on

Through the rain
And storms together
We can make it last
Boy, you know our love's forver
Take the time to see

And we'll go through
The rain and storms together
We can make it last
Boy, you knew our love's forever
Take the time to see

Hard times may come and go
But I'm here to let you know
I'll be here by your side

No matter what they may say
Your faith can abide in me
I'll always be here for you, baby
