I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met till u making me cry
And it's just too bad you've already had
The best days, the best days of your life

Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name
Brought up in a casual conversation
You can't think straight

And ain't it sad?
You can't forget about what we had
So take a look at her and do you like what you see
