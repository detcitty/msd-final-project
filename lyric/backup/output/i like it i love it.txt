I spent 48 dollars last night at the county fair
I throwed out my shoulder, but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' "Sugar Pie", "Honey", "Darlin'", and "Dear"
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm getting in too deep

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
