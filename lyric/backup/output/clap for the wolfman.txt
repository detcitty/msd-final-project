Doo Ron Ron and The Duke of Earl, they were friends of mine
And I was on my moonlight drive
Snuggled in, said "Baby, just one kiss", she said "No, no, no"
"Romance ain't keeping me alive"
Said "Hey babe, d'you wanna coo, coo, coo?", she said "Ah, ah, ah"
So I was left out in the cold
I said "You're what I've been dreaming of", she said "I don't want to know"
