Twist yourself further
From the middle of the floor
Throw a little kiss to
The woman next door

Step on the gas
Put your hand in the air
Make a V-sign and you
Throw back your hair

Think about nothing
Now you're nice and high
You're advocating love
But you don't know why

Now you're getting vibrations
All down to your feet
That's the brow beating
Heavy leather
Resurrection beat

Put your hand on your hips
Now you let your backbone slip

Put out your tongue
