You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard

Imma go hard, hard to the core
Hard like motherfuckin' liquid swords
Harder than worldwide stadium tours
I am the future, DeLorean doors

Will he survive? Never deceased
I don't think I'm ever gonna rest in peace
Imma kill the game, leave the rest in pieces
Now everybody want my recipe

Tell a jealous chicken I don't know what the beef is
I'm just making money for my gran' kids' nieces
Imma work hard, that's my basis
This beat is a shit, feces

Pardon me ma'am, Imma go dumb
Small.I.am, I'm complicated, hard.I.am
I end the beginning, then start it again

You can go hard or you can go home
