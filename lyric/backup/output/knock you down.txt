Heh. not again.
Ohh. this aint supposed to happen to me.

Keep rockin, and keep knockin

Whether you Louie Vouitonn it up or Reebokin
You see the hate, that theyre servin on a platter

So what we gon have - dessert or disaster?
I never thought Id. be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in. and knocked me on my face
Feels like in Im a race

but I already won first place

I never thought Id fall for you as hard as I did
(as hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinkin bout our life our house and kids (yeah)

Every mornin I look at you and smile
cause boy you came around and you knocked me down. knocked me down
Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around love comes around)
and it knocks you down

Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around
(love comes around)
and it knocks you down

Just get back up
When it knocks you down
(knocks you down)
I never thought Id
