Yesterday, when it seemed so cool
When I walked you home, kiss goodnight
I said "it's love", you said "alright".
Its funny how, I could never cry
Until tonight, when you pass by
Hand-in-Hand with another guy
You're dressed to kill, and guess whos dying...

Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears.
Dance away the heartache
