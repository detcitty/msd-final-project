Yeah, know how nights like this go
OVOFBG

60 naked bitches, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Smashing all the models, now we hit the waitresses
When you gettin' a lot of money you can't ever save it

But tonight, me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends we got money to spend

This adderall got me to the ceiling
I think them percocets had me in my feelings
I peel them hundreds on hundreds
I get money on money
I get guala on guala
I get dollars on dollars then throw out them dollars them bitches gonna holla
I got more style than stylists
