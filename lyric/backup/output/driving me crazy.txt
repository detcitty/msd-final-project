Yeah, Boston stand up, we got ‘em
Oh, Oh, Oh

Baby, you been driving me crazy
Can you be my lady?
Can you be my baby, baby driving me crazy

I’m walking on, walking on broken glass
Got a problem too many girls in class (yeah)
Wanna run a show but they just can't rap (no)
The idea around they head that the kid could rap
Fact, I kill stages all places
Nantucket and ACK city so they could taste it
But I’m real late no way I’ma make it
Back to my classes, the clock impatient (I’m back)
Well, apologize to the teach for me
Cause anything she speaks ain’t doing shit for me (ain’t nothing)
And my bad cant read notes
Still amazing like a chick with a deep throat
Treading water since the very thin ice broke
Now I’m neck deep in contracts
Psycho (yeah) I’m alright though, or I will be
Shake your ass ma, if you feel me

Baby, you been driving me crazy (crazy)
Can you be my lady? (be my lady)
