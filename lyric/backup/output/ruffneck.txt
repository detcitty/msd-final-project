Gotta what yo, gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what yo, gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what yo, gotta get a ruffneck

I need a ruffneck
I need a dude with attitude
Who only needs his fingers with his food
Karl Kani saggin' timbos draggin'
Frontin' in his ride with his home boys braggin'

Lying 'bout the Lyte how he knocked boots last night
But he's a ruffneck so that's aight
Triple O baldie under the hood
Makin' noise with the boys up to no good

C-low on the down low cops come around
So ruffneck front like he gotta go
Evil grin with a mouth full of gold teeth
Startin' beef is how he spells relief

Actin' like he don't care
When all I gotta do is beep him 911 and he'll be there
Right by my side with his ruffneck tactics
Ruffneck attitude, the ruffneck bastard

Gotta what yo, gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what yo, gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what yo, gotta get a ruffneck
