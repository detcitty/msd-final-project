We've been walking down this road some time
And you love, and you love me good, no lie
But there's something behind those eyes, those eyes
That you can't, that you can't disguise, disguise

Baby don't, baby don't
Baby don't lie
I don't wanna cry no longer
Baby don't, baby don't
Baby don't lie
I'mma need a love that's stronger
I tell you know, I tell you know
I tell you know, why
Know, why
If you ever give up, then we're gonna die
Now we're in the out, baby don't lie
