Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo
Yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes
Look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leavin' with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me
But they never figure me out
Look at me now
I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you, mama?
Imma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet

One more time

I said I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight
