Talk to me, tell me your name
You blow me off like it's all the same
You lit a fuse, and now I'm ticking away
Like a bomb... yeah baby

Talk to me, tell me your sign
You're switchin' sides like a Gemini
You're playing games
And now you're hittin' my heart
Like a drum... yeah baby

Well if Lady Luck
Gets on my side
We're gonna rock this town alive
I'll let her rough me up
'Til she knocks me out
'Cause she walks like she talks
And she talks like she walks
