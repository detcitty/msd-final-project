ey, baby, where you going
Now wait a minute
You can't leave now
Now we been through this before
And I'm tired, that's right
Sick and tired of the
Same old thing over and over
(CHORUS)
You're a runaway love
You're a runaway love
You're a runaway love
You're a runaway love
You're slick here
Playing with my feelings
You keep messing round
Playing with my heart
I find the things that you say
They don't have no meaning
And that is why I know
We're gonna have to part
(CHORUS)
Oh, stop playing with my heart
If you don't mean it
And stop playing with my love
If you don't care
Don't go around making jokes
Bout how you're using me
Cause I ain't got no
Heartaches to spare
You're a runaway love
You're a runaway love
(Just-a keep on running away
Run away, run away)
You're a runaway love
(Running, running, running)
You're a runaway love
Don't come around
Holding me and kissing me
Talking all that jive
