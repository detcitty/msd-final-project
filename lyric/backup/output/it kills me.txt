Oh yeah I've got trouble with my friends
Trouble in my life
Problems when you don't come home at night
But when you do you always start a fight

But I cant be alone, I need you to come on home
I know you messing around, but who the hell else is gonna hold me down
Oh I gotta be out my mind to think it's gonna work this time
A part of me wants to leave, but the other side still believes
And it kills me to know how much I really love you
