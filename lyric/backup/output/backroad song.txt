Barbwire fence carving out a hillside, cutting holes in the midday sun, like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust.
I love the rythmn of an old gray black top, 33's just whistling bye, steer the wheel one handed on a two lane hugging that line.
I got the windows down, No one else around
singing ohhhh
freedom is the miles I'm rolling on

ohhhhhh
out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong, come on come on, sing along sing along to my backroad song.
