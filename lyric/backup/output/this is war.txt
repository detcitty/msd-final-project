A warning to the people, the good and the evil
This is war
To the soldier, the civilian, the martyr, the victim
This is war

It's the moment of truth, and the moment to lie
The moment to live, and the moment to die
The moment to fight, the moment to fight
To fight, to fight, to fight

To the right, to the left
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the Earth
It's a brave new world from the last to the first

To the right, to the left
We will fight to the death
To the edge of the Earth
It's a brave new world, it's a brave new world
