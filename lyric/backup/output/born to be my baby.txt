Rainy night and we worked all day

Both got jobs cause there's bills to pay
We've got something they can't take away
Our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside

Don't need nothing when I'm by your side
Cause we got something that won't ever die
Our dreams, our pride
My heart beats like a drum

Flesh to flesh, one on one
I'll never let go
Something I know deep inside
You were born to be my baby
