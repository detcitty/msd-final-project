Are you cryin tonight?
Are you feelin all right?
I told the world that you were down on your luck

You were one of a kind
One who'd never give in
Even when they put a price on your head

Has anyone heard the tales you tell
Or seen the scars you wear
Did anyone speak up when you fell
Does anybody care

Rise again little fighter
And let the world know the reason why
