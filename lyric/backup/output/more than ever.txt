Do I
Do I love you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
I remember all I wanted in a lover
Was just a pretty face but all I found were hearts of stone
Spent a lifetime
On the road to nowhere till I found my way back home
You gave me shelter from the cold and the rain - whoa and
Now I know pleasure where there used to be pain
