Hey, yeah, oh, oh

I've been searching
Searching for so long
For that special guy
I can call my own
I never realized love could
Be so hard to find, ooh

I need a lover
A lover with a steady hand
Need somebody
Somebody who will understand
The one who could soon
Give me what I need

(CHORUS)
I need (someone who)
Can make me feel all right
(Someone who)
Can take me through the night
(Someone who)
Can make my feelings show
