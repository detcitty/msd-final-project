Fancy lady is masquerading
With a heart that nobody can see
Time is wasting there
There's no escaping it
How long will your sweet pleasure be

Fancy lady, you are just a stranger
To all the lovers you don't get to know
You try hiding all the broken traces
For the one love you had to let go

I got love, sample my wares
I got love, try if you dare
I got love, sample my wares
You got plenty love inside

Fancy lady, where are all the children
