You know how we get down
Oh yea
You know dat
Come on

[Verse one: omari

Like whoa
You know
Girl you're the star of my show
In this club
Poppin bub
The way you shakin deservin some dubs
Turn around
Make it bounce
Shake it like you come from out of town
Whats yo name?
Whats yo sign?
Girl you leavin with me tonight

[Chorus 2x
