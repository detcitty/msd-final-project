I would walk ten miles on my hands and knees
Ain't no doubt about it, baby, it's you I aim to please
I'd wrestle with a lion and a grizzly bear
It's my life, baby, but I don't care

Ain't that tough enough
Ain't that tough enough
Ain't that tough enough
Ain't that tough enough

For you, baby, I would swim the sea
