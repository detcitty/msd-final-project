Hey, pick it up
This'll get you out
You're head

China's heading up
By the ratings on a motion
She goes with a real head biker
He's a metalhead

She looks me up and down
Talkin' dirty eyes
Sweet sayin' boy
Baby, I can lick you any time

Keep it up
That's right
Here we go again

Bit later I'm gonna run them
Two around the back
