Everybody down in Huston calls him "Texas".
Everybody way up North calls him "Cornbread".
You shoulda heard the way that his momma called him "baby",
daddy called him "boy", his friends call him "crazy".

Shoulda just called it like I saw it.
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day.
The burning, the stinging, the high and the heat
and the "left-me-wanting-more"
