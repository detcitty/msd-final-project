She works the night, by the water
She's gonna stress, so far away from her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him
She tells him "ooh love"

No one's ever gonna hurt you, love
I'm gonna give you all of my love
Nobody matters like you
She tells him "your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life
You're gonna grow and have a good life

I'm gonna do what I've got to do"
So, rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
