Ah, the first time I met ya
I knew you'd be all I dreamed
I heard so much about ya
Reading in the magazines

Ah, but you old devil
You're better than I dreamed of
You old devil
Exactly what I've waited for
Exactly what I've waited for

And they call you New York
I love that city
New York, I love that city
I do, yes, I do
New York City
New York City, I do

New York City
I love you, I do

I met you at the airport
Got a little old cab into the Square
