Ooh... ooh...
Yeah...
Ooh...

Tonight I came home early
'Cause I just couldn't wait to see you (No)
You were on my mind (Yeah... ooh)
Lately I've been thinkin', baby (Yeah, thinkin')
All the ways I can make you happy
And tonight I'm gonna try

So just unwind (Just unwind)
Relax your mind (Relax your mind)
Leave your cares behind (Leave them behind)
Let's make love (Nice and slow)

{Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight}
Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you
{Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight}
Slow and easy, oh, yeah
{Slow and easy is the way I wanna love you tonight}
