F/ puff daddy, black rob

[puffy]
I see clearly now
Bad boy, ready
Dream
We rock the beat
And we rock the beat
I see clearly now
And we rock the beat
26, bad boy baby
Remix

[dream]
Pullin' petals off a flower, tryna get your way
Keep pullin' 'til it tells what you wanna say
Girl you can pick a field full of daisies
But he'd still be my baby

I know you can hardly wait 'til I'm away from him
Instinctively, I know what you're thinking
You'll be giving him an open invitation
