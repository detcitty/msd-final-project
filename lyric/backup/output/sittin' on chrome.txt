Sittin on chrome (8X)

Chorus: *with sample from Eazy E*

He once was a dog from around the way... [so you better take it]
Eazy![and I'm sittin on chrome]
He once was a dog from around the way... [so you better take it]
Eazy![and I'm sittin on chrome]

I just got paid...
It's Friday night...
I'm sittin on chrome...
And I'm feelin alright...

Verse One:

Take it EZ, like E cuz I be
Lettin niggaz know what time it is when it comes to me
You can't find us here anywhere and I tear
you a new asshole, as beautiful as gold
