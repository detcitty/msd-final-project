Close your eyes baby
Make a wish
Wanna try, wanna try
You love the power cause I'm flying high
Flying high

Cast a spell
Can you read my mind
Are you surprised
At what you find?

Chorus
So don't ask me to dance
Voodoo
Cause I'm caught in your magic spell
It's such a spooky romance
Voodoo
You can tell little honey
