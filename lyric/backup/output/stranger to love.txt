I've been around, 
I searched the whole world over.
Lookin' for 
Unconditional love.

I hear the sound, 
A million hearts in motion.
I feel the passion, 
But it never seems enough.

But you me, 
The Earth moves under my feet.
The walls came tumblin' down.

[Chorus:]
I've been through the fire, 
Right down to the wire, 
But I'm still a stranger to love.
I've felt desire, 
And it took me higher,
