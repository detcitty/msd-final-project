I never thought that I was so blind
I can finally see the truth
It's me for you
Tonight you can't imagine that I'm by your side
'Cause it's never gonna be the truth
So far for you

But can you hear me say?
Don't throw me away
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday but all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime

I wanna I wanna I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way and when they set me free
