A cloud hangs over
This city by the sea
I watch the ships pass
And wonder if she might be

Out there and sober
As well from loneliness
Please do persist, girl

It's time we met and
Made a mess
I picture your face
At the back of my eyes

A fire in the attic
A proof o' the prize
Anna Molly

Anna Molly
Anna Molly
Do do do do dume - do

Do do do do dume - do
Do do woh ho oh
A cloud hangs over
