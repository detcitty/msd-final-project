Ooohhh
Put your lovin' hand out, baby

I'm begging

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out baby

Beggin', beggin' you

Put your lovin' hand out darling
Ridin' high, when I was king

Played it hard and fast, cause I had everything

Walked away, won me then

But easy come and easy go
And it would end

So why anytime I bleed, you let me go
Anytime I feed you get me know
Anytime I see you let me know
