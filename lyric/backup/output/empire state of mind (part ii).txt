Oh, New York
Oh, New York

Grew up in a town
That is famous as a place
Of movie scenes

Noise is always loud
There are sirens all around
And the streets are mean

If I can make it here
I can make it anywhere
That's what they say

Seeing my face in lights
Or my name on marquees
Found down on Broadway

Even if it ain't all it seems
I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from
