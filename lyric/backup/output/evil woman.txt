You made a fool of me
But them broken dreams have got to end

Hey woman, you got the blues
Yes you ain't got no one else to use
There's an open road that leads nowhere
So just make some miles between here and there

There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in
You took my body and played to win
Ha ha woman it's a crying shame
But you ain't got nobody else to blame
