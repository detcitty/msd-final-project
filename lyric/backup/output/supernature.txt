Once upon a time
Science opened up the door
We would feed the hungriy fields
Tilll they could'nt eat no more

But the potion that we made
Touched the creatures down below
And they grow up in a way
That we'd never seen before
Supernature, supernature, supernature, supernature

They were angry with the man
Cause changed their way of life
