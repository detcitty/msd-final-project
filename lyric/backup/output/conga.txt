Come on, shake your body baby
do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body baby
do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer.

Come on, shake your body baby
do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat

Everybody gather 'round now
let your body feel the heat.
