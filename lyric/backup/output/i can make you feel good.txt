Are you the kind to put your heart on the line
Or one who stays out of reach
? Cause unlike other guys I won't waste your time
I just wanna practice what I preach

Girl, love can be such a challenge
A game where there can be two winners
Unlike any sport
It depends on the prize
And knowing where the real thing lies
To make a long story short

Baby, I can make you feel goodI can make you feel good
Let me lay this good love on you
Baby, I can make you feel goodI can make you feel good
You can say I really want you
Oh, it's so good

There's guys that offer you diamonds and pearls
Those are the ones without the need
