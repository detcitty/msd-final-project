Say brother, can I borrow a thin brother
You know, a dime?
Say it, say it, say it sis
I'd sure like to have this little dime for me
So I can get this cup of coffee
Cop me a snack, somethin'
I guess I better quit tryin' to be hip and get on down
Yea man, like, you know

I was born in New York City on a Monday
It seems I was out shinin' shoes 'bout two to noon
