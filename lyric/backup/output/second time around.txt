I know you come a long way, baby
But you don't need that heart of stone, no
You proved that you could do it, do it, baby
You could make it on your own

But you can't keep runnin' away from love
'Cause the first one let you down, no, no, no
And though others try to satisfy you, baby
With me true love can still be found
Love can still be found

The second time around
Ooh, the second time is so much better, baby
The second time around
And I'll make it better than the first time

You know I really love you
And I paid for my mistakes, yes, I did, girl
