Whoo!
Yeah, darkchild
B-Rock let's go

Why don't you return my calls?
Why you trip out where I be?
You don't ever come to see me

You say that you're too busy (what?)

What the hell?
I don't have time
Why you messin' with my mind?

I can find another guy
Someone who will treat me right

I don't need this bullshit
I won't put up with it, any longer
You can, go if you want
I don't, need you pity
I will, be just fine

If you decide, that you want to leave
Close the, door behind you
I just, want to know what...

What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
Nights that you gave
What about all of the
Things you told me
What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
