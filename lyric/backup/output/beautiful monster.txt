All my life
And the hereafter
I've never seen
Someone like you
You're a knife
Sharp and deadly
And it's me
That you cut in two
But I don't mind
In fact I like it
Though I'm terrified
I'm turned on but scared of you, oh
She's a monster
Beautiful monster
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind
And I need her
