Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love
Little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes
And give it to the likes of me

Oh, little Jeannie
She got so much love
Little Jeannie
So I see you when I can
You make me all a man can be

And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others
Who would treat you cruel
And, oh, Jeannie
You were always someone's fool
