I don't wanna be your Monday morning heading back to work
Stuck in traffic going slow, nothing on the radio
I don't wanna be another chore to check off on your list
Things you gotta do, places that you gotta go, oh no

I wanna be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime sunshine barefoot in the moonlight
I wanna be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
