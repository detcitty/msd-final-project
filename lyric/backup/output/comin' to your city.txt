Well we're comin' to your city
Gonna play our guitars and sing you a country song
We'll all be flyin' higher than a jet airliner
And if you want a little bang in your ying yang come along

Well we flew through Cincinnati and we all got really happy
Grabbed a bowl of that skyline chili along the way
Then we rolled on into Canton scared the hell out of Marilyn Manson
And the party started happenin', hey hey hey

Then in the middle of a Charleston night, we ran into Jessica White
And a little moonshine got us right plumb smack insane
