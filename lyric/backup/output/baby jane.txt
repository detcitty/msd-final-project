Baby Jane
don't leave me hanging on the line
I knew you when you had no one to talk to.
Now you're moving in high society
don't forget I know secrets about you.
I used to think you were on my side
but now I'm no longer sure.
I wish I knew what I know now before.
When I give my heart again I know
it's gonna last forever.
No one tell me where or when I know
