I've been watching you for a long time
You look so good, got my eyes on you

Verse 1:
I've been watching you
for so very long.
Trying to get my nerves built up
to be so strong.
I really want to meet you
but I'm kinda scared.
Cause your the kind of lady
with so much class.
I get my thoughts together
for the very next day.
But when I see you lady
I forget what to say.
Your eyes and hair
such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk,
it really turns me on.
Oh yeah you really turn me on
come on, come on, come on.
