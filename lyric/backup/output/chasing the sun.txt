I'm better
So much better now
I see the light, touch the light
We're together now

I'm better
So much better now
Look to the skies, gives me life
We're together now

We've only just began
Hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun

They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just began

You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
