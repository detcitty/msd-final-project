Make every minute worth it, baby
This for Usher, baby (watch this)

I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessin' that it's true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, ba-baby
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you

It's 5 in the mornin'
Kush is rollin' while she's makin' steak and eggs
At 5 in the mornin'
We can only be about to do one thing (what?)

See, I told her
The devil is a lie
Them other girls can't compete with mine
You do it so good, you fuck my mind
You pull it out, then you open wide
You make me wanna tap out and retire
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired

I think that she's a winner
She could be a keeper

'Cause she's such a good kisser
Got lipstick on my leg
