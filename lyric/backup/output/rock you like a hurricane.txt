It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking, pretty loud
My cat is purring and scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?

The bitch is hungry she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave it's time for a show

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
