Bless my soul. What's wrong with me?
I'm itchin' like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm acting queer as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up

Oh, oh, oh
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

My hands are shaking and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
