Whoa
Oh yeah
Look what we've got

We got a, we got a love
We got a, we got a love
We got a, we got a love
We got a, we got a love
We got a, that's how a love should be

Can't stand it when you're away
Without a doubt,
You're the best thing
That's happened to me

Yeah baby, and I just can't wait
To have you by my side
