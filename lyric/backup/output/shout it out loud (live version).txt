Well, the night's begun and you want some fun
Do you think you're gonna find it (think you're gonna find it)
You got to treat yourself like number one
Do you need to be reminded (need to be reminded)

It doesn't matter what you do or say
Just forget the things that you've been told
We can't do it any other way
Everybody's got to rock and roll, whoo, oh, oh
