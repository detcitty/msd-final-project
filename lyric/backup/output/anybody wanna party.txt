Ah ahhh party party
Ah ahhh party party
Ah ahhh party party
Ah ahhh party party

Love, sweet love won't you be good to me?
You could set me free
Come on, set me free
We could dance 'neath the pale moonlight
Feeling good tonight
Feeling good tonight

Please somebody's got to get me to the action
Some satisfaction is what I've been searching for
Got to find myself a happy situation
Some celebration
Somebody who calls for more

Anybody wanna party down tonight?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party?
Anybody wanna party down tonight?
Anybody wanna party?
