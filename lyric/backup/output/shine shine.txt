I've never been sorry for the way I was raised

The enemy fewer and the love that I made was the symbol on the times

A celebration of the wine I made a memory in you.
I'll still be the reader of the letters you write

I've never been lonely for the rest of my life
there's a corner in my heart

Oh
we can never be apart
no
we can never be apart.
Look tomorrow
