I know it can get kinda tough sometimes you know
I know you can kinda get carried away with yourself
But err, why dont you be real with me and be real with you at the same time
You can’t get what you get here no where else ma
keep it real now

You know, You know (you know you love this)
You know you love this life
Don’t nobody do you like me
You know, you love 
(I say I know)
You-you know you love this life
Don’t nobody do you like me
You know

Cavalli dress and high heels
And drop tops on hot wheels
We live how we wanna live cause we got mills
Them other barely barely buy a hot meal
In VIP dem bottle poppin’ do it B.I.G.
Come get with T.I.P be ballin’ til you d-i-e
Invisible set bracelet, see clearly
Take away your stress mean that sincerely
Problem solve ‘em, nevermind that
