Konvict, Konvict

Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh

I peeped you on the phone
Just showin' off ya stones
And notice that that pinky ring is right enough baby
I know you're not alone

But I could just be wrong
The way them fellas houndin' and sizin' you up baby
And I like the way you take advantage of every man you love
I see, I seem to know your game girl

But I don't mind if ya come and play ya thug just don't talk too much
I see, I see it so you don't have to say a word
Yeah those guys wanna come treat ya right

Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop

Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin hot
Girl you know that you need to stop
