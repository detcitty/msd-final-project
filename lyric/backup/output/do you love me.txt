(Do you love me)
I can really move
(Do you love me)
Said I'm in the groove
(Do you love me)
Do you really love me now
Now that I, I can dance

Watch me now

(Work, work)
Gonna work it out, baby
(Work, work)
Drive me crazy
(Work, work)
With a little bit of soul, child

From rocking and rolling
(Rocking, rolling)
Doing the slam (do the slam)
Tell me, baby (tell me, baby)
Do you like it like that
(Like it like that)

Come on, tell me (yeah)
