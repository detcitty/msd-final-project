Stop
Let's
Take this real slow
Let me break it down so that you can know
I'll do things
You never imagined me to do
I'll lick you all over
As the sweat
Pours down on you

Girl I want
To lick you up and down
Come on and let me do
What I can do
Come on
And tell me what you need
Cause I just want to
Taste the sweetness
From your body
Let me

Chorus:
Come on and let me lick you up
Come on and let me lick you down
Come on let me lick you around
Up and Down

You will feel my fire 
let me lick.
