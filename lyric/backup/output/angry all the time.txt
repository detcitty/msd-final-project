Here we are
What is left of a husband and a wife
With four good kids
Who have a way of getting on with their lives
And i'm not old but i'm gettin' a whole lot older everyday
It's too late to keep from goin' crazy
I've got to get away

chorus:
The reasons that i can't stay
Don't have a thing to do with bein' in love
And i understand that lovin' a man
Shouldn't have to be this rough
And you ain't the only one
