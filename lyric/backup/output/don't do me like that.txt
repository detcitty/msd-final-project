I was talking with a friend of mine
Said a woman had hurt his pride
Told him that she loved him so
Turned around let him go
Then he said, "You better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size"

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
What if I love you baby?
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that
Someday I might need you, baby
Don't do me like that

Listen honey, can you see?
