Secret Session

Take my money
My house and my cars
For one hit of you
You can have it all, baby

'Cause makin' love
Everytime we do
Girl, it's worse than drugs
'Cause I'm an addict of you
And you know that I

I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin'
(Got me goin' crazy)
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin'
Girl, I'm feenin' for you

(Said, I'm feenin' for you)
