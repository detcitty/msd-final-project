No one looked... as I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said no to him... again and again
First he took my heart... and then he ran

No one knows how I feel
What I said unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand... take me home

Stand back... stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright... it's alright
To be standing in a line
