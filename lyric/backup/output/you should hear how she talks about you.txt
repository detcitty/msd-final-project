She's so very nice you should break the ice
Let her know that she's on your mind
Whatcha tryin' to hide when you know inside
She's the best thing you'll ever find?

Ahh, can't you see it?
Don't you think she's feeling the same?
Ahh, I guarantee it
She's the one who's calling your name

You should hear how she talks about you
You should hear what she says
She says she would be lost without you
She's half out of her head
(Out of her head)

You should hear how she talks about you
She just can't get enough
She says she would be lost without you
She is really in love
(She's in love with you boy)

I ain't tellin' tales, anybody else
Could repeat the things that I've heard
(Heard)
She's been talkin' sweet and it's on the street
