Ohhh baby
I dedicate this to all the pretty girls
All the pretty girls
Its on All the pretty girls, in the world
And the ugly girls too
Cause to me your pretty anyways baby

You give me your number, I call you up
You act like ur pussy dont interrupt
I don't have no problem with you fucking me
But I have a little problem wit you not fucking me
Baby you know ima take care of you
Cause you say you got my baby, and I know it ain't true
Is it a good thing? no its bad bitch
For good or worse, makes you switch
So I walk on over with my crystal
Bitches, niggaz put away your pistols
Dirty wont be having it in this house
Cause bitch I'll cripple your style
Now that you heard my calm voice
