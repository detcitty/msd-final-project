Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked

Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
That's my fam, I'll hold 'em down forever
Us against the world, we can battle whoever
Together ain't no way we gonna fail
You know I got your back, just like a turtle shell
Nobody do it better, all my brothers tryna get some cheddar
We all want our cut like the Shredder
Me and my bros come together for the dough
Bought the orange Lamborghini, call it Michelangelo
With the nunchucks doors and I'm pullin' up slow
When we fall up in the party, they know anything goes

Check my rolex they say I'm the man of the hour

All this green in my pockets, you can call it turtle power
