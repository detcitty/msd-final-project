Hey girl, what's your name girl
I've been lookin' at you
And every guy here's doin' the same girl
It'd be a shame girl
If I let you just walk on by
'Cause I'm all caught up in your sweet smile
A girl like you comes around once in a while
So hot, gotta give it a shot
Gotta get get a little bit of what you got

I know you don't know me but I can't leave here lonely
Knowin' I didn't even try to make you mine and
You might think I'm crazy
Girl but who could blame me
