Educated, with money, he's well dressed, not funny

And not much to say in, most conversations
But he'll foot the bill in, all situations
Cause he pays for everything...

Girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money...
Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny...

Paper... or Plastic?, don't matter, she'll have it!
