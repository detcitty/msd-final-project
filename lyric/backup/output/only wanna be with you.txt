You and me
We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me
When I look at other girls

Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby
'Cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I'll only pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance
