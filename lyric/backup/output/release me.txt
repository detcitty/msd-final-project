I know, that it's time for a change, mmh
But when that change comes
Will it still feel the same?

How many times have I tried to turn this love around?
I don't wanna give up but, baby
It's time I had two feet on the ground (ground, ground, ground)
Can you release me?
Can you release me?

Now that you're gone I can't help myself from wondering
Oh if you'd have come down
From your high, would we've been all right?
Release me!
Can you release me?

Come on, baby
Come on, baby, you knew it was time to just let go
