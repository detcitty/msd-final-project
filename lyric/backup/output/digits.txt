Thugger! YSL for life
We ran up them digits we ran up some money
We ran up them digits we ran up some money
We ran up some digits.

Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep going
You can lose your life but it gon' keep going
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep going?
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say we...

We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up that money
We ran up them digits we ran up some money
We ran up them digits we ran up some money
We ran up them digits we ran up some money
