Watch my life pass me by
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time
Are becoming clearer

I don't wanna waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes, yeah

â€˜Cause I want you and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been

Now I'm broken and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me
