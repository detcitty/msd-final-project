Well, I see the souls of so many friends
And I see us all back here again
With sandy floors and celing fans
A rastafarian one-man band
With songs that fill my memories like a tip jar
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar

I see tourists at Christmas time
And I taste beers with a hint of lime
I feel lonely 'cause it's not the same
Different faces and different names
Living like pirates out among the stars
Yeah, that's what I see
