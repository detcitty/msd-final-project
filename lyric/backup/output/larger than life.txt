I may run and hide when you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see?
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
