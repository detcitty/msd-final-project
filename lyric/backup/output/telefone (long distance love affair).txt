I've been away from you
For far too long
Too much chances
Make my heart go frantic
I wanna tell you
What's been going on
Operator, give me Transatlantic

I sit alone as the night goes by
Stare at the phone
And wait for your reply

Long, long distance love affair, oh, oh
I can't find you anywhere, oh, oh
I call you on the telephone
But you're never home
I gotta get a message to you
