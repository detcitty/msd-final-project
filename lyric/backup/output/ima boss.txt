I'm ridin' dodge, I'm ridin' by, on the westside which side am I
Beemer 760I try me, let off sixty shots
Again we got the city hidin', poppin' like it ‘posed to be
Bitches who are not ménaging got no business standin' close to me
So cold, a ferocious G, you niggas ain't as dope as me
Mind your fuckin' business, watch your mouth when you approachin' me
I fuck with hoes who fuck with hoes, pills and powder socially
I like em, I ain't love ‘em though, cold heart emotionally
Exactly where the ocean is, ridin in a ghost again
Slap you with a lot of spit until she swallow all of it
Call the shots, run the shit, on some big money shit
Serious 'bout my hustle all these cowards on that funny shit
Rappin' 'bout a bunch of shit
And you ain't even done it yet
You the one they gunnin' at
How i'm ‘posed to honor that
You all talk dawg, flaw and I ain't havin' none of that
I'm big boss dawg floss all day, run it back

Bitch, i'm a boss, bitch, i'm a boss!
I'ma boss, i'ma boss
I play the shots
I call the calls
We in this bitch'
It's goin' downn
Yeah, i'm the king

Now where my muf-ckin' crown?

I'ma boss, she a boss
We don't care what it cost
You just buy that muthaf-cka and you throw that muthaf-cka on
You keep poppin' them tags

We just throw it in bags
And then we hit the fucking block, we be droppin' them rags
