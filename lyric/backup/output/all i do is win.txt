All I do is win, win, win no matter what
Got money on my mind, I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up

And they stay there, and they say "yeah," and they stay there
Up, down, up, down, up, down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in, put your hands in the air, make 'em stay there

Luda, Ludacris goin' in on the verse
Cause i've never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up, put 'em in the sky
For the homies that didn't make it and the folks locked down
I never went nowhere
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Ludayac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flows
My hands go up and down like strippers' booties go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out, y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
