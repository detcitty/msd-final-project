Free, free, set them free (Oh whoa)
Free, free, set them free
Free, free, set them free
Free, free, set them free
If you need somebody, call my name
If you want someone, you can do the same

If you want to keep something precious

You got to lock it up and throw away the key
If you want to hold onto your possession
Don't even think about me
If you love somebody
If you love someone
If you love somebody

If you love someone
