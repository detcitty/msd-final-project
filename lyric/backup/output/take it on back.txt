Take it on back
Take it on back
Take it on back to where the grass is greener
Yeah.
Huh, Alright.

She was a south Georgia stunner
Hotter than hell in July
We tasted heaven that summer
Then said good-bye and I don't know why 'cause
We'd park down by the river
Steam up them windows real good
I Wish I could go back and see her
You know I would lord if I could

Take it on back
Take it on back
Take it on back to where the grass is greener
Take it on back
Take it on back
Back to when she and me were true believers
In love and all the things that come with it
