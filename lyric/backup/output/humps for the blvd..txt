Yeah, I got some humps for the boulevard
Turn it up, pump it up, cuz it's hittin hard
I'm gettin down y'all, just for the fuck of it
I got a hold of the mic like a vice grip
I got a vision, but it's different than Mariah's
I wanna hear you pumpin in pile drivers
No matter what kinda speakers you got
I know the Fostex amp is gettin hot
The bass knocks hard just like the police
And the fans eat it up like a fuckin feast
Rodney O, one funky individual
