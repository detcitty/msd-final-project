This is me and my niggas, my family
And people that care about me, my fans
Fuck all these other niggas

I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can't ever front, know why?
It's not my style, no lie

Fuck all the talk
In time, they'll burn
I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
I can't ever front, know why?
Its not my style, no lie
They'll never take me alive
King Wizard!

You love that little bit of new, now throwback
Cleveland City snakeskin snapback
Niggas know the uniform, keep the brim low
You doubt him, don't know a damn thing about him
What is hip hop without him, y'all niggas just really don't know
Go, all day every day, hold on with all might
I gave the world my heart and they gave the kids insight
Yup now fuck you I ain't left
I'm outta my mind like all the time
And a nigga ain't missed one step (yet, yup)

I can't decide
What if life's a lie?
I push the lames aside
They'll learn
