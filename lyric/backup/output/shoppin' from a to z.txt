Good girls shop, bad girls shop
Shopping, shopping from A to Z
Good girls shop, bad girls shop
Shopping, shopping, shopping
Shopping, shop, shopping

I went shopping
With a list from A to Z
Everything I needed
For a happy family

Walked through the doors
Give the box boy a smile
Grabbed a silver buggy
And I boogied down the aisle

I got A (apple) B (banana)
C (chili) d (dog food)

Snapped up the frozen food
Chicken pot pie
Rolling through the produce
That's a better buy

Satisfied the munchies
With an open bag of chips
Lady with the samples says
