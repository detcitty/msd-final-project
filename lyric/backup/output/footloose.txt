Been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours, for what
Oh, tell me what I got
I got this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Now I gotta cut loose
Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, gettin' back
C'mon before we crack
Lose your blues

Everybody cut Footloose
You're playing so cool
