Yeah, yeah!
I need a Winn-Dixie grocery bag full of money (whoo!)
Right now to the VIP section (whoo!)
You got Young Mula in the house tonight, baby (yeah!)
Yeah, haha, yeah, Young (ay-hey)
Young, Young, Young, Young Mula baby!

If you got money (yeah) and you know it (yeah)
Then take it out your pocket and show it then throw it like
(Fly!) This-a-way (fly!) that-a-way
(Fly!) This-a-way (fly!) that-a-way
If you getting mugged from everybody you see
Then hang over the wall of the VIP like
(Fly!) This-a-way (fly!) that-a-way
(Fly!) This-a-way (fly!) that-a-way

Now I was bouncing through the club
She love the way I diddy-bop
I see her boyfriend hatin' like a city cop
Now I ain't never been a chicken but my fifty cocked
Say I ain't never been a chicken but my semi cocked
Now where your bar at? I'm tryna rent it out
And we so bout it bout it, now what are you about?
DJ showin love he say my name when the music stop
"Young Money, Lil Wayne" then the music drop
I make it snow, I make it flurry
I make it all back tomorrow, don't worry
