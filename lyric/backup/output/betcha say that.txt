Betcha say that
Betcha say that
To all the girls

You say you'll be my knight in shining armour
We'll run away and live a life of glamour
You say for me you'll be true blue

You say you want me everywhere beside you
And that you just cannot live without me, no
You say I love you

I betcha say that to all the girls
Betcha say that, betcha say that
