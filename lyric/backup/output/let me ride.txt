Creepin' down the back street on D's
I got my glock clocked 'cause niggas want these
Now soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a tech 9 tryin' to take mine
You wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call my niggas comin' like the Gotti boys
Bodies bein' found on Greenleaf
With their fuckin' heads cut off, muthafucker I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rollin' in my 4 with 16 switches
& got sounds for the bitches, clockin' all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by 'cause I'm too hard to lift
And no this ain't Aerosmith
It's the muthafuckin' D R E from the C P T
On a rhymin' spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top your trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop pop pop
Yeah 'cause if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse, go back & take another stop
'Cause I'm rollin' in my 6 4
With all the niggas sayin'...

Swing down sweet chariot stop & Let Me Ride.
Hell Yeah.
Swing down sweet chariot stop & Let Me Ride.
With all the niggas sayin'...
