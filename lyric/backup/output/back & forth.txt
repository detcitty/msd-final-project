Let me see you go back (Who is the L I Y A H?)
Let me see you come forth
Now let me see you go back (Who is the L I Y A H?)
Let me see you come forth
Uh, now let me see you go back (Who is the L I Y A H?)
Let me see you come forth
Uh, let me see you go back (Who is the L I Y A H?)
Now let me see you come forth, yeah
It's Friday
(Hey)
And I'm ready to sing pick up my girls
And hit the party scene

Tonight oh it's alright, hmm
So get up and let this funky mellow grove get you in the mood
'Cause you know it's alright, yeah
(So Mr. D.J. keep the music groovin')
Keep on groovin'
(Don't stop movin')
Don't stop movin'
Let me see you, let me see you go
Back, back, forth, and forth
Go back
Let me see you go

Back, back, forth, and forth
