Come here, lil mama come here
there oughta be a law the way you walk in them pants
comin up in here half dressed, where ya clothes at
what your name and where you get them pretty toes at
she barely good but good with curse words
spend all my money up, smoke all my herbs
crash the coupe, make her count that too
no matter what ya do you're still my boo
she run the streets more than i do, boo da doo
can't talk to ya cause she keep an attitude
hid the stash, hit the cash, ain't ask to borrow
