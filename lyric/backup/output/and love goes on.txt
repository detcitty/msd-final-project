I would be so willing
To give you all I got
You're a special lady
Forget me not
I could be so tender
For the likes of you
Let my heart surrender

And love goes on
On and on
Your heart beats strong
As love goes on

Everyday, I'm wishing
For that day to come
Feeling superstitious
Hoping she's the one
One day I am lonely
Next with plenty smiles
Love I find amusing
