Hey hey!
[foreign content]

I've loaded up a good thing
To see the way she feels
Faster than a sosa home run
She's gonna get a little huh huh yeah

Look at her now
She wants to take the wheel
She says, "'You dirty dog"
"You wanna rock the bop and take it home"

Why oh why, am I gonna play?
So many times it goes this way
My heart gets blown away
These eyes are born again

Do you remember how we were?
Do you remember summer days?
Sometimes I feel like going down, down
(Hey)

Walk like a loaded man, yeah
(Down down)
Get the bump to the bump de bump de bump soul
(Down down)
