You can't run away forever
But there's nothing wrong with
Getting a good head start
You wanna shut out the night
You wanna shut down the sun
You want to shut away
The pieces of a broken heart

Think of how we'll lay down together
We'd be listening to the radio
So loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming
Like a gift of the gods
Someone must have blessed us
When he gave us those songs

I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
