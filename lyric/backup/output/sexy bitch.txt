Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same, and I wanna meet her

They say she low down
It's just a rumor, and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood whore
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful
