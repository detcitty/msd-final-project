It still feels like our first night together.
Feels like the first kiss
It's getting better baby
No one can better this.
Still holding on
You're still the one.
First time our eyes met

Same feeling I get
Only feels much stronger
I wanna love you longer
Do you still turn the fire on?

So if you're feeling lonely, don't
You're the only one I'll ever want
I only want to make it go
So if I love you a little more than I should
