New Cupid, time for a change
Cupid shuffle, Cupid shuffle
Cupid shuffle, Cupid shuffle
(New style)

Down, down, do your dance, do your dance
(We got a brand new dance)
Down, down, do your dance, do your dance
Down, down, do your dance, do your dance
Down, down, do your dance, do your dance
(New style, yeah)

They say I'm a rapper and I say no, come on
They say what you doing, tryna do some Zydeco
I just let the music come from my soul
So all of my people can stay on the floor

They got a brand new dance, you gotta move your muscle
Brand new dance, it's called the Cupid shuffle
It don't matter if you're young or you're old, here we go
We gone show you how it go

To the right, to the right, to the right, to the right
To the left, to the left, to the left, to the left
Now kick, now kick, now kick, now kick
Now walk it by yourself, now walk it by yourself
(Let me see you do)

Down, down, do your dance, do your dance
Down, down, do your dance, do your dance
(A let me see ya do the Cupid)
