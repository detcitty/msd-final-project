You're off the hook
MmmÂ…

Unlike my past relations
You were into more than friendly datin', yeah, hea
Well, you didn't have time for games, you were ready to stake your claim
And I felt just the same way about you

It started out with just one touch
But little did I know I'd get this much
Lovin' (Ooh), kissin' (Ah), huggin' (Ah)
