Shawty Lo, I got flavor
Plus you know, the kid got paper
Like 40, don't savor
Bankhead been pullin? capers

The way you drop woulda thought I had a taser
Call me street, like a razor
Shawty Lo, ATL, I'm the mayor
Street nigga but my gear be tailored

Every now and then, Shawty might rock gators
Me and that kush, I got acres
