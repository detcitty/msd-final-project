Well she's all you'd ever want,
She's the kind they'd like to flaunt and take to dinner.
Well she always knows her place.
She's got style, she's got grace, She's a winner.

She's a Lady. Whoa whoa whoa, 
She's a Lady.
Talkin' about that little lady,
and the lady is mine.

Well she's never in the way
Always something nice to say, Oh what a blessing.
