She calls me up and says baby it's a lonely ol' night
I don't know I'm just so scared and lonely all at the same time
Nobody told us it was gonna work out this way
No, no, no, no, no
I guess they knew we'd work it out in our own way

It's a lonely ol' night
Can I put my arms around you
It's a lonely ol' night
