Yeah, yeah oh
Yeah, yeah yeah

That's the way everyday goes
Every time we have no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
