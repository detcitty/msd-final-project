Ayo baby, tell your friends... to get with my friends
And we can be friends, this the remix

Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind
Cause I know you wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about
If you want it then I got it
We can be body to body, Body to body
I don't mean to rush you girl
But We should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

What it do lil' mama, I was thinking we'd get more acquainted
Baby this the G-mix we get heated leave them panties ain't it?
She say her last was super wack his sex was overrated
Gotta give her da good I'm liking da wood and now it's over lady
I give her that pound game, then I slows it up
Nibblin' on ya ear, she love that teasin' stuff
See youse a nasty girl, wit yo fine ass
If it's wet enough I might just need a wine glass
