I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify

Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc

Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work The LOX
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan

Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club

Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: "Dawg, in due time!"

Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg! You where I am!"
A hip-hop legend, I think I died
In a accident, cause this must be heaven

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
