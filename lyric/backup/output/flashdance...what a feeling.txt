First when there's nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
deep inside your mind

All alone I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone

Well, I hear the music
Close my eyes
Feel the rhythm
Wrap around
Take a hold of my heart

What a feeling
Bein's believin'
