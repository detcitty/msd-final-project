You see the face on the TV screen
coming at you every Sunday
see that face on the billboard
that man is me.
On the cover of the magazine
there's no question why I'm smiling
you buy a piece of paradise
you buy a piece of me
I'll get you everything you wanted
I'll get you everything you need
don't need to believe in hereafter
just believe in me

Cos Jesus he knows me
and he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus all my life
oh yes he knows me
and he knows I'm right
and he's been telling me
everything is alright
