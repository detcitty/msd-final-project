Oh.Oh
Talk that talk to me, yeah
Oh... Oh

Talk that talk to me, yeah
I be trying to chill, biches wanna fuck me
Every little city I go, fuck me
Shorty must've heard
Got the word, I move that D
Had it by a bladder
She like, oh I gotta pee
Ran into a rocko in my restroom
Singer slash actress in my bedroom
God I have the ticket for a walk through
Everything that do is big
I talk big money, I talk big homes
I sell out arenas
I call that getting dome
Million dollar voice
Came through phone
We heading to the top

If you coming, come on
I'm Flying out to Pisa
Just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica
