We can get down, baby
Down, down, down, uh
When you come around, baby
We can get down

We be gettin' down, baby
Down, down, down, uh
We can get down, baby
Down, down, down, uh

We can get down, baby
Down, down, down, uh
When you come around, baby
We can get down
We be gettin' down, baby
Down, down, down, uh

Let me take my time and hold you
I really wanna get to know you, baby
Your body language is enough for me to feel
Love that's in your heart and I know that it's for real

Ooh baby, you don't mess around
I love the way we get down
Another minute we'll be in it, you and me
Lovin' you for days, can't you see that

We can get down, baby
Down, down, down, uh
We can get down, baby
