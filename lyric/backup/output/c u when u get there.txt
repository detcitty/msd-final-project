Coolio feat. 40 Thevz
C U When U Get There
Now I've seen places and faces
and things you ain't never thought about thinkin'
if you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin'
and smokin'
pretending not to loc'in but you're broken
let me get you open
now little Timmy got his diploma and
little Jimmy got life
and Tamika round the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
the other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his 20
and when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
but who's the dummy, cause you just lost a hustler
a down ass brother been replaced by a buster
and though I got love for you, I know I can't trust you
cause my crew is rollin' Hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters
and just because of that you act like you don't like a brother no more
I guess that's just the way it go
I ain't tryin' to preach, I believe I can reach
but your mind ain't prepared
I'll see you when you get there

Chorus:

I'll see you when you get there
if you ever get there
see you when you get there
