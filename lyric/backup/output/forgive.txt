I always said that'd be it
that I wouldn't stick around
if it ever came to this
and here I am
so confused
how am I supposed to leave?
when I can't even move

In the time it would have took to say
"honey I'm home how was your day?"
you dropped a bomb right where we live
and just expect me to forgive
