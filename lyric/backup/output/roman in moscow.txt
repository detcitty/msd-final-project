I'm big bully no bike gear
I told you b-tches last year
I'm a rap b-tch nightmare
That's why I call you buzz lightyear
Cause by the time you start buzzin
B-tch you gon' have white hair
Paparazzi was a fright scare
When I landed out in London
It was looking like Mike Dare, Mike Jack
Who's bad, ain't know my period
But I got a new pad
Channel 5, news flash
P-ssy clean, who smash
None of y'all, canary yellow ball
These b-tches should be worshipping me in the synagogue

Hum, hum, done the prayer
B-b-b-b-tch I ball, underwear
Hum, hum, done the prayer
Did I tell them that I ball, underwear
Okay roman
Y'all want the full roman?
Y'all want the full roman?
Y'all want the full roman?
