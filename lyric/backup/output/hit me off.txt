Verse 1
Bobby:
She's the finest thing
I've ever seen
Looking like a natural queen
I said, let me take you for a ride umm baby
To the other side
We can do just what you like girl

B sec:
We can get started as long
As you're ready
As long as you're ready babe (baby)
Anyway you want it

Chorus:
Hit me off (oh baby, yeah)
Hit me off (oh I like it when you)
