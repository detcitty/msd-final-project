Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...

Jungle life
I'm far away from nowhere
On my own like Tarzan Boy
Hide and seek
I play along while rushing cross the forest
Monkey business on a sunny afternoon
Jungle life
I'm living in the open
Native beat that carries on
Burning bright
A fire the blows the signal to the sky
I sit and wonder does the message get to you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...

Night to night
Gimme the other, gimme the other
chance tonight
