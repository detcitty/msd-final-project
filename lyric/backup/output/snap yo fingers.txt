What's happenin'? Dis ya boy Lil Jon! BME Clik!

Hey! Now ladies and gentlemen, it's about dat time
To turn this thang on out
Now let me see everybody do this.
Hey! Let's go!

Snap ya fingers! Do ya step!
You can do it all by yo self!
Let me see you do it! Ay!
Let me see you do it! Ay!

Snap ya fingers and then rock wit it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, gon drop wit it
Do a step wit it put your hips wit it
All my ladies let me see ya put a twist wit it

You can't do like me, I'm by myself
I do it so good, I don't need nobody else
