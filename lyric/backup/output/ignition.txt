You remind me of somethin'
I just can't think of what it is

Girl, please let me stick my key in your ignition
babe
So I can get this thing started and get rollin', babe
See, I'll be doin' about 80 on your freeway
Girl, I won't stop until I drive you crazy

So buckle up 'cause this can get bumpy, babe
Now hit the lights and check out all my functions
babe
Girl, back that thing up so I can wax it, baby
Honey, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe

'Cause we off up in this jeep
We foggin' up the windows
We got the radio up
We all up in the back
We got the shit bouncin'
We goin' up and down
And we smokin' and we drinkin'
Just thuggin' it out

Jump up, down once I hit them switches, babe
And I'm about to take it where you wanna go, babe
Guarantee you I'm about to get some mileage, babe
And it won't be no runnin' out of gas, babe

It's like woo... pull over, baby
