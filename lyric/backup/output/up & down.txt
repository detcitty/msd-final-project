Tumbling Dice
Trackmasters in the mix

We just came to get on down, get on down
We just want to have some, have some fun
We just came to get on down, get on down
We just came to have some, have some fun, fun

I know you've been
Through some real hard times
But don't let this world
Take the best from you
