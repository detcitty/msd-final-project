These bitches love Sosa
O End or no end
Fucking with them O boys
You gon' get fucked over
Raris and Rovers
These hoes love Chief Sosa
Hit him with that cobra
Now that boy slumped over
They do it all for Sosa
You boys ain't making no noise
Y'all know I'm a grown boy
Your clique full of broke boys
God ya'll some broke boys

These bitches love Sosa
And they love them Glo' Boys

But we cannot go boy

Convertibles, Lambos boy
You know I got bands boy
