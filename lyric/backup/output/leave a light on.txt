Take my hand, tell me what you are feeling
Understand this is just the beginning
Although I have to go, it makes me feel like crying
I don't know when I'll see you again

Darling leave a light on for me, I'll be there before you close the door
To give you all the love that you need
Darling leave a light on for me, 'cause when the world takes me away
You are still the air that I breathe
