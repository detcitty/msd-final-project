I've seen this world
From corner to corner
There ain't much ground
That I haven't covered

I've drank its wine
I've tasted its pleasures
I've known some love
And I've known some lovers

If there's one lesson
In the livin' I've done
The best things only come
Along in numbers of one

There's only one Eiffel Tower
One finest hour
