Life is full of lots of up and downs
And the distance feels further when you're take that clock to grown
And that nothing more thank full you the filling steaks, your down...

It's so hard to know the way you feel inside...
When there's many thoughts and feelings that you hide...
But you might feel better, if you let me walk with you by your side...

And when you need, a shoulder to cry on...
When you need, a friend to rely on
When the whole world is gone
