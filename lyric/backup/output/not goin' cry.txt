While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else

Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids I have nothing to show
Wasted my years a fool of a wife
I should've left your ass long time ago

Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

Well, I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
