Well, woke up this morning
With a wine glass in my hand
Whose wine?
What wine?
Where the hell did I dine?
Must have been a dream
I don't believe where I've been
Come on
Let's do it again
Do you... you feel like I do?
How'd ya feel?
Do you... you feel like I do?
My friend got busted just the other day
They said
Dont walk, dont walk, dont walk away
Drove him to a taxi
