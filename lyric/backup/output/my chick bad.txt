My chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My, my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could

My, my chick bad, better, better than yours
My, my chick bad, better, better than yours
My, my, my chick bad, better, better than yours
My, my chick bad, better, better than yours

Listen, I'm saying my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My chick bad, better than yours
My chick do stuff that I can't even put in words

Her swagger don't stop, her body won't quit
So, fool, pipe down, you ain't talkin' 'bout shit
My chick bad, tell me if you've seen her
She always bring the racket like Venus and Serena

All white top, all white belt
And all white jeans, body looking like milk
No time for games, she's full grown
My chick bad, tell your chick to go home

My chick bad, my chick hood
