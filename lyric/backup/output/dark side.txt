There's a place that i know
it's not pretty there and few have ever gone
if i show it to you now
will it make you run away
Or will you stay
even if it hurts
even if i try to push you out
will you return?

and remind me who i really am
please remind me who i really am

Everybody's got a dark side
do you love me?
can you love mine?
