Here we are, just the two of us together
Takin' this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if we're found out, it could mess up
Both our happy homes
(HIM)
I hate to think about us all meetin' up together
'Cause as soon as I look at you it will show on my face, yeah
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can't let 'em know, no, no, no
We can't leave a trace
(BOTH)
