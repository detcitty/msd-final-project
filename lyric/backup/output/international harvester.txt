I'm the son of a third generation farmer
I've been married ten years to the farmer's daughter
I'm a God fearin' hard workin' combine driver
Hoggin' up the road on my p-p-p-p-plower
Chug a lug a luggin' five miles an hour
On my International Harvester

Three miles of cars layin' on their horns
Fallin' on deaf ears of corn
Lined up behind me like a big parade
Of late to work road raged jerks
Shoutin' obscene words
flippin' me the bird

Well you may be on a state paved road
But that blacktop runs through my payload
Excuse me for tryin' to do my job
