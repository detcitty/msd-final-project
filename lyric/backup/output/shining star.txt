Yeah, hey, hey
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams will take you very far, yeah
But when you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems, oh yeah

What you see on nights so clear, hey
In the sky so very dear, yeah?

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be
