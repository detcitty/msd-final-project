She was a woman on a mission
Here to drown him and forget him
So I set her up again to wash him down
She had just about succeeded
When that low-down no good cheatin'
Good for nothin' came struttin' through the crowd
Ah he was layin' it on so thick
He never missed a lick
Professing his never ending love
Oh but I never will forget
When she stood up and said
So I guess you think we're just gonna kiss and make up doncha?
That's when she said.
