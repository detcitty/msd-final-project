A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster (buster buster)
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So...

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

Well a scrub checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know he can not approach me
'Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass
So... (yeah yeah yeah)

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
