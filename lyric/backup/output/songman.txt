Songman, sing your song
Until the morning comes
I can listen as long
As you can play
Songman, can you teach me
How to make someone feel good
I think I have a song or two
That I might wanna
Sing like you someday

When I was young
He'd come around from time to time
He could make that old piano ring

I remember how my daddy smiled
