Sometimes a love won't let go
Hard as I try I know it shows
Everybody's telling me
You'll be over her eventually
But how am I supposed to feel so secure

When I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes somehow
And I keep wonderin'
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wonderin'
What magic can be found
