Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Hey hey hey hey yeah

Stand up, you don't have to be afraid
Get down, love is like a hurricane
Street boy, no I never could be tamed
Better believe it, yeah

Guilty till I'm proven innocent
Whiplash, heavy metal accident
Rock on, I wanna be president
'Cause I love it

Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Right between the eyes
Loud, I wanna hear it loud
Don't want no compromise

Turn it up, hungry for the medicine
Two fisted till the very end
No more treated like aliens
We're not gonna take it

No lies, no more alibis
Turn it up, got me hypnotized
