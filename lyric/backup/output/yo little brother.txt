Yo Little Brother
Yo Little Brother
I got a brother younger than I
And my little brothers on the wild side
Heâ€™s hangin out getting high always on the scene
And always rappin to the girls
You know what I mean
And when pop came in tonight he found
Little brother was not around
He looked up checked the clock
