This one goes out to all sides world wide
Let that play ass nigga thumpy be your guide
As we go on a ride with playa hatin' killers and hood niggas thrive
And lame mah'fuckers can barely survive

Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man, my whip so big when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch to let her hair down
What this shit costs?
Tell me, baby, if you 'bout that life right now
I hope it ain't talk, no

I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up?
Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours"
On a blimp?

Tell her be free, baby spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you 30 thousand feet
On your knees in them Prada's
Makin' freaky shit come up out her
