I Know where it's at (I know where it's at) 3 x
I know
I know
I know (Where it's at)

If you wanna have a good time (I know where it's at)
If you know you got something on your mind (I know where it's at)
If you know that you wanna get on down (I know where it's at)
Don't deny
Don't be shy just come around

I've been watching you and I know you like to party baby
And you know that that sounds a really good to me yeeah
Everybody wants to hang out at my party baby
Don't you know that this is the only place to be
(Don't you wanna come and see it)
If you know that you wanna get on down (Bop Bop)
No need to worry cuz All Saints will be around (Bop Bop)
So if your feeling kinda lonely baby don't (Bop Bop)
Cuz I'll be here right by your side ready to flow (Ready to flow)

(I know where it's at)
If you wanna have a good time
(I know where it's at)
If you know you've got something on your mind
(I know where it's at)
