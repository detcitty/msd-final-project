Yeah
Well, I don't care what they say
I know this is right
Because I feel it deep in my heart
They say we're young and wild
We should wait for a while

But nothing's gonna keep us apart
But I don't think we're living in sin
So we can't give up, we can't give in
Because our love is strong and it can't be wrong

Ooh and it feels so right
