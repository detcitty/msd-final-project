Black Ice (Goodie Mob Version)

Shit
And we come to win
We gon' hit all the hemispheres
Bottom Dirty South, yeah

Costly, trey slippery
The gangsta hippie, damn skimpy
We in your face
Lightning told?
Suckers, getting hit for losses
Not even makin' it back, to the line of scrimmage
Seizin' those scrubs out, starters in
Midnight madness, somethin' to us
From A to Z
Bustas get blocked
For sinning papers, word is bogus
Freeloaders get dropped out
Pay docked
Rollers, wanna be callin' shots
Non-believers hot, under the collar
Goodie to be more dope boys, and Mister C
Generatin' dolllars
We don't leave to be followed
I holler

Touched what I never touched before, seen what I never seen before
woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high
