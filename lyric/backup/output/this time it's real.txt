Saw me a girl today
Who walk with such a gentle sway
And I knew right from the start
She was the one who can cop my heart
I know someday
That we could happen
In a special way
I wish I may
I wish I might
Make you my all-star shining bright
And I know, I can feel it
This time it's real
Other girls that I had were fine
