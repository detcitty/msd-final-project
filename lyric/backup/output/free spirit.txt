In the dawning of the social revolution
In an age when "do you your thing" was never done
I met a woman like I'd never known
A girl with a mind of her own
She spoke freely

She began to talk about a new horizon
She said "come with me babe, we shall overcome"
She said "excuse me while I kiss the sky
