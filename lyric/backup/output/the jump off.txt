Whoa! (Whoa!) Whoa!
(Yo', it's goin' down now)
Aiyyo Tim man this the G-Mix right here man! (Jump off!)
Whoa! (Whoa!) Whoa! (Whoa!) Whoa! (Queen Bee, Mobb Deep)

I been gone for a minute now I'm back at the remix
Lil' Kim, Mr. Cheeks, M-O-B mix
Pump the Jag, come through in the V6
By the end of the night, I'm in the G5th
All we wanna do is dance
The way I eat tracks, call me Ms. Pac-Man
And if the fans don't fit in the minivan
Murk out in somebody's Sedan
You thought the Sprite can was off the meter
Imagine what I'd do with a two litre
You see my nipples gettin' hard through the wife beater
Fuck the tele, we can do this in the two-seater
Got every color diamond in the cross
I ain't scared to crossover, ya'll niggas is soft
My man follow me everywhere of course
To hear my theme music, muthafuckin' "The Jump Off"

This is for my peeps, with the Bentleys, the Hummers, the Benz
Escalades twenty three inch rims
Jumpin out the Jaguar with the Tims, keep your bread up
(It's the Jump Off)
