Let's blow out these city lights 
Let's just leave it all behind 
Get up where the air is still 
You can hear the whippoorwill 
Start a fire pass the shine 
Won't be home till mornin' time 
Shout your name out in the wind 
Confess my love for you again 
Give you all I got to give 
That's how we live up on the ridge 

Won't you come with me tonight 
Where moonlight drifts into your eyes
