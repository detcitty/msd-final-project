You kiss me real good now
Like I knew that you could now
Time to do what you should now
Because you're getting to me

Oh, no, no, no, boy
Got to take it real slow, boy
This is far as we go, boy
Until you hear what I hear

I hear those church bells ringing
Will you marry me
Will you carry me
Across the threshold tenderly
