I talk to you but it's not the same
As touchin' you
And every time you whisper my name
I wanna run to you

We'll be together
It won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever
And its hard to be strong
Baby 'cause I'm missing you now
And its drivin' me crazy, how I'm needin' you baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait till I'm alone with you

To show you how I'm missing you now
