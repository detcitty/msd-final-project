Whoa now
When I'm kissing my love
Yeah thump a thumping in my head

Whoa now
When I'm kissing my love
I close my eyes and see a pretty city
With a million flowers babe

Now I can hear the angels sing
Songs that only angels sing
She's such a pretty thing
That I can feel my heart
Just a thumping and a skipping
