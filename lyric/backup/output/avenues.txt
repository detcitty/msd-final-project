Ooh no, ooh no
Say, we gonna rock down through, Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Say, we gonna rock down through, the Brooklyn Avenues
And then we'll take it higher, ooh no, ooh no
Yo, yo, slick like Rick Rick James when I hit
(Hit)
Super freak chicks, who I don't miss
(Yo I don't miss)
Fix for your nose, my flows make you sick
(Uh, uh)
Two chicks for me, none for you like Twix
Play with niggaz head like 'Clef guitar picks
Went from, bottom pits to, making hits
And hollow-tips then, shooting lips
(Right)
Handle our business make sure it sits
Ride through the tunnels fuck the guest lists
(Crusin' by)
Light up your block with roman candlesticks
Known to blow shows with pyrotechnics
(Right)
Rappin' 'bout your whips while you catchin' transits
Buyin' shorty gifts, with checks from WIC
Your record sound like a demo that was yet not mixed
