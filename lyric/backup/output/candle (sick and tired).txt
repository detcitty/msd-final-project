I took her out on a February morning
Just getting over it and dealing with the mourning
I started thinking out loud
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

My baby's flying off the edge of the road
She's saying, "I'm so sorry about that note"
That left me all alone
But I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me what's wrong
I'd be lying if I told you
Losing you was something I could handle

Somebody turn the lights on
Somebody tell me how long
All this darkness will surround you
'Cause I'm burning for you
Burning like a candle
