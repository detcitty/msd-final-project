He broke your heart
He took your soul
You're hurt inside
'Cause there's a hole

You need some time to be alone
then you will find
what you've always known
I'm the one who really love ya, baby

I've been knockin' at your door
and as long as I'm livin'

I'll be waitin'
as long as I'm breathin'
I'll be there
whenever you call me

I'll be waitin'
