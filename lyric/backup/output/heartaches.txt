Look at me
I was just a man who was lonely
Had some time on my hands
The world's greatest plans in my jeans

I saw you, you came on to me like you knew me
I don't think you knew that it threw me
I didn't know what to say to you then
I knew it would end up in

Heartaches, visions of loving you
And heartaches, wishing we hadn't met for my sake
Seeing you here, is all I can stand

Every night, I stand on the street
