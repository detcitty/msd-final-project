Born into this world a baby, 
You're mind is clear as the air
Time passes... 
You learn to walk and talk
Time passes... 
You learn right from wrong
Time passes... 
You leave home seeking a life
Of your own... 

I'm tellin' you the natural facts
For way this world
Listen to me people... 
You make your own heavens and hell
Right here on earth
