"Time flies when you're having fun"
I heard somebody say
But if all I've been is fun then baby let me go
Don't wanna be in your way

And I don't wanna be your second choice
Don't wanna be just your friend
You keep telling me that you're not in love
You wanna throw it all away

But I can't stay away form you
