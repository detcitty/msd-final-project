Oh, ho, ho
Oh, oh
Ho
Hey, hey, yea
Oh, ho

Silver moon
Shining on my bed
Beside my pillow
Light the pathway
To bring that man
To me

Oh, ooh
Something tells me
My words
Are goin' straight
To his heart
And ooh
Somethin' tells me
You will be all mine

Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinkin' of you, oh
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you
You got it goin'
You turn me on
Baby, come to me

Oh, ooh

Know a secret
How to make you want me
How to make you love me
Whoa
Sure
As there's a moon above
It's a friend of mine
It still makes you burn

Said, ooh, ooh
Something tells me
The fires
