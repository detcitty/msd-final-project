The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
take a look around
We're quick to laugh when they've got troubles (ooh ooh)
and we put 'em down

We go
We're not so hot you know
It's like a roller coaster
On a downward motion
On a one way street
We can't control our feet
We're on the road to ruin
Don't know what we're doin'

She may be quiet
She may be shy
But don't you bring her down
