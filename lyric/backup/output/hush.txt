[7 Aurelius]
Hush baby, wanna let you know
This is how it's gonna go

[chorus: 7 Aurelius]
Hush baby, wanna let you know
This is how it's gonna go
If you wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, don't talk so much
Just wanna feel your touch
Everything will be okay
If you do it my way (my way, my way)
Hush baby

[verse 1: LL Cool J]
You feel so good
Rest of my life, I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood
Mild-mannered or up to no good
It really doesn't matter, either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold you close
Jump in the drop spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in your mind
Runnin' out of time
Drama of all kind
But there's faith in our mind
We spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
