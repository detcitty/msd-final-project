I, I've got the room upstairs from you
It's a room without a view
But all that could change if I just get through, up to you
And I, keep my feelings to myself
I've never reached for someone else
But lately I'm thinking how cold I've been
And now I begin to see that I should
Dare to fall and with your help take down the walls

Strange but true, I think I've got a thing for you, yeah
