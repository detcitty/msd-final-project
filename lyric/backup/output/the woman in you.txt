The woman in you brings out
the man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy

But baby sharper than a knife
help me to know you
Show me the night to satisfy
A sinner with the flash of an eye
There'll never be another me

I never knew love could wind me up
I don't do my stuff
"till you go walkin' by
And maybe old enough to try

I never knew anyone in between
