Woo, gave you my money, I gave you my time
Why you want to hurt me, girl
Are you serious, I'm just curious
Why you want to hurt me, girl

Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl

Never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no

You took my money, you took my time
Made me think everything was fine
Then you upped and ran away
And made me just go crazy

I never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no, no, no

Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you hurt me, girl

I never, ever had a lover
Who put the peddle to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no, no, no
