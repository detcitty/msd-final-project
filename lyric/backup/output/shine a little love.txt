Although the things you've done I wouldn't criticize.
I guess you had your way.
You see I gotta make you understand.
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say.
But it don't matter baby 'cos' today's another day.
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see.
Remember, tonight we're gonna run till dawn
Remember, tonight we're gonna say.
We'll never stop we got a good thing goin' on.
I know you've heard it all before.
But I really need you darlin' every day I need you more.
