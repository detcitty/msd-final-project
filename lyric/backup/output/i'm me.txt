The hottest under the sun
Who dat?
Ain't nobody fucking with me, man
And you already know that, pimpin'
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
Fuck up my dream
Somebody gon' die tonight
And you already know that, pimpin'

Ay, it's Cash Money Records, man, a lawless gang
Un-fucking-believable
Lil Wayne's the president
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy
It's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch
Call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money
Til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him
Bury him?
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight, baby
So I don't let the devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar
Yeah, bitch, I'm heavy metallin'

You can get the fucking Led Zeppelin

Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estrogen

And we hold court and take your life for a settlement

Yes, I am the best
And no, I ain't positive, I'm definite

I know the game like I'm reffing it

This is Tha Carter
Tha Carter 3

The New Testament
