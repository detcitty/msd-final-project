Something special
Unforgettable

Goddamn, damn
She, she, she want it, I wanna give it to her
She know that it's right here for her

I wanna see her break it down
I'm ballin', throwin' money around
She a workin girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as hell, she 'bout the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money, money, she makin', makin'
Look at the way she shakin', shakin'
Make you want to touch it, make you want to taste it
Have you lustin' for her, go crazy face it now
Don't stop, get it, get it

The way she shakin' make you want to hit it
Think she double jointed from the way she splitted

Got you're head fucked up from the way she did it
She's so much more than you're used to
