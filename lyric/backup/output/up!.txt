It's bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way - yeah, it just ain't my day
Nothin's comin' easily

Even my skin is acting weird
I wish that I could grow a beard
Then I could cover up my spots - not play connect the dots
I just wanna disappear

Up, up, up - Can only go up from here
