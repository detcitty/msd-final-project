run away if you want to survive

Money, sex, in full control
a generation without soul
perfect people in a perfect world
behind closed doors all in control
life in a world of luxury
cold cash money mentality
you gotta keep the faith
you gotta keep the faith

you better keep the faith and run away

Run away
run away
run away and save your life
run away
