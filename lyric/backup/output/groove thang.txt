Well, its a groove thang, it's gotta funky swing
Well, it's a groove thang, a groove thang

Come on

We're moving on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang

We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang

We're moving on, keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang

We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang

Oh yeah, ah
