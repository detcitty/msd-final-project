When you trust someone
And you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trustin' about you

And you claim that you
Don't care where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you

Say you trust someone
Why ya callin' all around
Think I've got some dip on the side

Girl you don't trust no one
And you constantly in doubt
You lose the game
If you play that way

Get up off me back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody is humpin' around

No matter what they say
No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

When you love someone
And you want to love 'em right
Got to get more lovin' about cha

When you know
That you're holdin' on too tight
