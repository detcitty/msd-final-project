I've never seen a boy who
Looks as good as you tonight
I'm feeling kind of fresh
You know, I'm looking out of sight

I know a little place
That we can run away and hide
And the only way to go is
On a magic carpet ride

Come on and take a ride with me
I'll show you just how fun
My love can be
Put your heart into my hands
I'll take you to a wonderland
