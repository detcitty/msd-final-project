Your crazy attitude is spoiling everyone's fun
All you wanna do is take the money and run
All I ever get from you is desert and sun
It's much too late to change your mind, the damage is done

I've tried to see your point of view but baby, come on
The situation's vacant, now the season has gone
All I want to know is why it took you so long
It's much too late to change the tune, I don't like this song

Heartline
You get your number changed
Bad sign
'Coz I won't be callin' again
