It's 7: 35
She's someone else's wife
And I can get on with my life
And that thrills me
She married him today
Her daddy gave the bride away
I heard a tear rolled down her face
And that kills me
â€˜cuz now I, can see why
She's finally crying

How was I supposed to know
She was slowly lettin' go
If I was puttin' her through hell
Hell - I couldn't tell
