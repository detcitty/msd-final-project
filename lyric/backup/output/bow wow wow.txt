I bow wow wow yippy-o yippy-a to the funk
Punk
I put you in my trunk
Like a good fella, I'm a good speller
Yet I get retarded like hellen keller
Take it, I'll kick it, better I'll flick it
Just like a booger, I fuck around with hookers

Like Tina Turner, I'm a fast learner
Earning up my wealth, now I go for self
Like barney rubble, who's always in trouble
I'm quick on the double, you'll never see me fumble
Like a quaterback, think I outta smack
Wack MC's who think they're all of that

I bow wow wow yippy-o yippy-a to the funk
A bow wow wow
I bow wow wow yippy-o yippy-a to the funk
A bow wow wow
