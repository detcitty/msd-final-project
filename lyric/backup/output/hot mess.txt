You were a problem child
Been grounded your whole life
So now you're runnin' wild
Playin' with them good girls
No that ain't your style
You think you're hot shit
And oh, I love it, I love it
Yeah

Stumbling but yeah
You're still lookin' hella fine
Keep doin' what you're doin'
And Imma make you mine

Well you're a
Hot mess and I'm fallin' for you
And I'm like
Hot damn, let me make you my boo
Cause you can shake it, shake it, shake it
Yeah, you know what to do
You're a hot mess, I'm lovin' it
Hell yes

Got me hypnotized
The city's your playground
I watch you take a bite
