SPOKEN
There's probably a lot of you girls out there hung up on a man
And you're caught in that old familiar way of wanting someone
Who don't want you
You know, men are full of schemes
And they're masters of getting control of our minds and making
Us dependent on them

As I look back to the day you left me
