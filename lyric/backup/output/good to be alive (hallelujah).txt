I've been grinding so long, been trying this BAD WORD(shit) for years
And I got nothing to show, just climbing this rope right here
And if there's a man upstairs, he kept bringing me rain
But I've been sending up prayers and something's changed

I think I finally found my hallelujah
I've been waiting for this moment all my life
Now all my dreams are coming true, yeah
I've been waiting for this moment

Feels good to be alive right about now
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now
Good, good, good, good to be alive right about now
