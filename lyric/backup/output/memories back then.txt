Aye, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kind of slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She want to hang with us, we want one thing
Just penetrating her throat, dawg
She choke on it like smoke, dawg
But whenever I fucked up my reup
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefa
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can pay to put a "69"
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
"Why you always give your ass up?
I mean damn these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid, this shit don't add up."
She said, "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back, I still fuck"
And that's fucked up, she's so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds till' it goes down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name because she married now

When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
