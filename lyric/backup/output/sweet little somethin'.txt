Just what I had in mind
Thinking about the weekend
Standing by the Yeti with the party lights plugged in
Got a jug of feel good, going around
There's just one thing missing, baby, right about now

I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you

I see you dancing over there with your girlfriends
Got your fine self showing off that sun tan
You keep smiling that smile at me
Like you're reading my mind, and you know...
