I turned on the evening news
Saw an old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today

Asked him what's the secret to life?
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said, "All I can say is

Don't blink, just like that you're six years old
And you take a nap
And you wake up and you're twenty-five
And your high school sweetheart becomes your wife

Don't blink, you just might miss
Your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads
Next thing you know your better half

Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years
