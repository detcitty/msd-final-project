Seven hours since you went away
Eleven coffees
Ricki Lake on play
But late at night
When I'm feeling blue
I'd sell my ass before I'd think of you
Seven hours since you closed the door
Started a diet, got a manicure
Erased your number from the telephone
And if you call me I won't be at home
He said

Why don't you cry
For the guy?
Said goodbye
Run away
Why'd you cry
For the guy?
Said goodbye
I said OK

Cause

Ooh boy d'ya miss me like a hole in the head?
Because I do boy
And it's cool boy and
Ooh betcha never thought I'd get out of bed

Because of you boy
Such a fool boy

11 hours on a brand new day
I'm getting ready to go out and play
It's late at night
I'm caught in a groove
I'll kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue
