Yo', this Jay-tweezie
keepin it live off the heezie fo' sheezy
with them 504 Boyz you dig, check it
This here's to be played loud as possible
Perferably in residential neighborhoods
and night clubs
so grab your shorty and go

hook

Now won't you wobble wobble
Let me see you shake it, shake it
Now won't you drop it, drop it
Ohh, take it, take it (2x)

(Mac)
You already know what's happenin'
when I step in this Bitch
And I know you heard of me,
cause I'm right there off of GT
and Derbigny
You've been 'bout servin' it,
ever since you heard my song
I got you bucked up,
You want that camouflage love, huh
You got me fucked up
I just want to see you wobble,
like your momma's won that lotto
Like your daddy full of that bottle
Like your brother
when he caught them hollows
Like them G.T. Bitches,
them Saint T. Bitches,
my no limit Bitches
Them boss bitches who 'bout they riches,
and it ain't no secret
They want that soilder Dick
that you only get from that
