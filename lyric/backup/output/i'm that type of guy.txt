You're the type of guy that can't control your girl
You try to buy her love with diamonds and pearls
I'm the type of guy that shows up on the scene
And gets the seven digits, you know the routine
You're the type of guy that tells her, stay inside
While you're steady frontin in your homeboy's ride
I'm the type of guy that comes when you leave
I'm doin your girlfriend, that's somethin you can't believe
Cause I'm that type of guy

You're the type of guy that gets suspicious
I'm the type of guy that says, the puddin is delicious
You're the type of guy that has no idea
That a sneaky, freaky brother's sneakin in from the rear
I'm the type of guy to eat it, when he won't
And look in the places that your boyfriend don't
You're the type of guy to try to call me a punk
Now knowin that your main girl's bitin my chunk
