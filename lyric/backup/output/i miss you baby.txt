I've life the life
Of a many things
Drink wine with tramps
And I dine with thieves

I've done most anything
A woman could do and exist
But til I met you, baby
There was something I had missed

Yes, there was
I missed the two of us
Sharing each other's heart
I missed the joy of love
Right from the very start

I missed your tenderness
The way you hold my hand
But most of all, I missed
The love of my man

Many a girl have gone my way
