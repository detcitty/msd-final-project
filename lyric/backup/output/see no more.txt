Oh... And I don't want to see no more

It was saturday when I got that call
Far away from feeling tall
I know, I know, I know what the truth is, yeah
I tried to look away from what you did
Heartache became my friend oh...

You walked away from me baby
I would've never done the same
You made me feel like our love was not real
You threw it all away, so.

I don't want to wait for you
I don't want to wake up thinking, hopin
You'll it get right this time
'Cause you know that you're so cold
And I don't wanna see no more

And I can't get away from you
That's one of the reasons why
