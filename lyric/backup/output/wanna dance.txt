Na na na na na...

I wanna dance with you
There's no reason why
Why I shouldn't try and try

I like to see you move
It makes me feel so right
I can groove with you all night

Mmm, feels so perfect just tonight
And I been searching
Searching for a guy

I wonder where you are
Get up now
Give this night a try

Don't be cool
Forget it, baby
Let's do something about it
I just saw the way that you looked
There's no reason to hide it
