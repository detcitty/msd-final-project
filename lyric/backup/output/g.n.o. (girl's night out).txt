Don't call me, leave me alone
Not gonna answer my phone
'Cause, I don't, no I won't see you
I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
'Cause, I don't and I won't need you (oohh, oohh)

Send out a 911 (oohh, oohh)
We're gonna have some fun (oohh, oohh)
Hey, boy, you know you better run

'Cause, it's a girl's night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out and play out
Without you
You better hold tight
This girl's night is without you (oohh, oohh)

Let's go, G.N.O. (oohh, oohh)
