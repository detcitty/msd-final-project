I've been victimized by a devil in disquise
That you pulled the rug from under my feet
All those hopes that you made in bed
I think you forgot really what you said but you failed right asleep

I haven't seen you since one night of love
When I unlocked the door and gave it up!

(I've been double crossed) Hey!
By double dealing, double wheeling
Looks like I'm the one who lost)

(I've been double crossed
By double dealing double wheeling
looks like I'm the one who lost)

He didn't apologize for putting these tears in my eyes
Made a fool out of me
I think you knew right from the start

How you were going to win my heart by using trickery

I'll never put my trust in love again
The same thing might happen in the end
