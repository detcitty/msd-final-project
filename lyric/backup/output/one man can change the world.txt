They used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you wanted that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, is pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

Hol' up, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots
But its hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know, my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib
Like it was trash day, no Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash
