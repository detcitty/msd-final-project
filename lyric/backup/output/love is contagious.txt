Was a girl in the rain, no one else could feel her pain
Was a boy all alone, nothing left to call his own
Something came along, secrets of surprise
Force of love was far too strong, saw it in their eyes
They tried and they tried
They tried but they couldn't play it off

Love is contagious when it's alright
Love is contagious
