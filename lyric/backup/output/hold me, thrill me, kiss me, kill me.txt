You don't know how you took it
You just know what you got
Oh lordy, you've been stealing from the thieves
And you got caught
In the headlights of a stretch car
You're a star

Dressing like your sister
Living like a tart
They don't know what you're doing
Babe it must be art
You're a headache, in a suitcase
