Yesterday, yeah, I had the blues
I couldn't win
All I did was a loss

But now
I got everything
You made my poor heart sing
Cause I got you baby
Oh, yes I do

Yesterday, yesterday, I had to cry
(Yesterday I had to cry)
Oh lord
Things were so bad
I wanted to die

But now it's just a memory
You made my poor heart sing
I'm so glad I got you baby
Oh, yes I am

You filled you filled
You filled my heart
With so much dark
