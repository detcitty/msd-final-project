I hear it from my friends
I hear it on the street

I hear it in the air here and there

everywhere and from everyone I meet
And everytime I hear you love me
oh
my heart skips.

But I wanna hear it from your lips

You never told me
you never told me.
I wanna hear it from your lips
you never told me.
