I used to think one day
I would tell the story of us
How we met
And the sparks flew instantly

People would say
That they're the lucky ones
I used to know

My place was a spot next to you

Now im searchin the room

For an empty seat

Cuz lately I dont even know

What page you're on

Oh a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that

I wish you knew
So many walls up

I can't break through
Now im standin alone
In a crowded room
And we're not speakin
