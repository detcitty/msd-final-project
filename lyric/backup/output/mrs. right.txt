Where is Mrs. Right?
I gotta find her, her.

Where is Mrs. Right I gotta see her,
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Get me on a flight I gotta see her,
Travel all across the world just to meet her
Travel to LA and maybe to the Bay,
Come to Chi-Town, she might be out the states,
Book a flight to London, book a flight to France,
Can we go to Switzerland, can we hit Japan?

Shawty say ya don't but I bet you do,
MB on your ring tone, posters in your room,
Sassy little thing, like, like the way you talk,
Heard you got the goods go ahead show them off,
Take a picture quick, send it to my phone,
Dimple in your cheek, white Gucci stunners on,
Don't know where you've been hiding from me so long,
Prodigy, Roc, RayRay and Princeton we on
So baby come on

Where is Mrs. Right I gotta see her,
