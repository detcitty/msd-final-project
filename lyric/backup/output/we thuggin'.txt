Ooh, mmm
Yeah, uh, uh
Fat Joe and the R
That shit y'all
Breakin' shit down
Shake that, funky, funky, funky
Yeah
Sticky, icky, icky, yeah uh
I got that shit y'all
I got that shit y'all
Uh yo yo

Crack man and I'm at it again
Niggas had they run, now it's time for change
When we step in the club, nigga tuck ya chain
Got the mink on same color the Range
Uh, pour liquor for my nigga that's gone
Big Pun! Then we party like we just came home
Fuck a bitch if she act to grown
I don't need that shit, I got my wife at home

Uh words slurrin', dirty urine
Drunk off of Henry and the 'jo keep burnin'
Dancin with shorty and her friend keep flirtin'
I don't always crush two but tonight seems certain'
