I been burning Bright
For so long I can’t remember
Pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work
Believe me when I say, I can’t stay this high forever
This man’s had all he can stand, time to lay this body down

Can I stay with you a while
Cause this roads been putting miles on my heart,
Sweetheart I’ve been livin in a fantasy
But one day Lightning will strike
