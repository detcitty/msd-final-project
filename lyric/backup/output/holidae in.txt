Bomb ass pussy
Ma ooh you got that bomb, know you got it
Ma ooh, you got some bomb ass pussy
Ma, I know you got that bomb bomb pussy

(Whachu doin'?)
Nothing chillin, at the Holidae Inn
(Who you wit?)
Me and my peeps won't you bring four of your friends
(What we gon' do?)
Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin

(Whachu doin'?)

Feel on each other and sip on some Hen
One thing leading to another let the party begin

Peeps call me up said it's a ho-tel party
Just bring the liquor, there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way, let me stop by the store
Get a 12 pack of Corona, plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?

Now I'm on Highway 270 the Natural Bridge road
I'm already blowed, get thurr I'm a get blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Vallet look like he in the game and must be winning

To room 490 I'm headed on my way up
There's three girls on the elevator like, "Wassup"
I told em follow me they knew I had it cracking B
One said, "Ain't you that boy that be on B.E.T?"

Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped wit much ding-a-ling
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face!
Fuck it then, feel like my head a toxic waste

There's some pretty girls in here, I heard em whispering
Talking about, "That's that dude that sing, 'Right Thurr' he glistening"
I ain't come to talk, talk, I ain't come to sit, sit
What I came for was to find out who I'm gon' hit, aww shit
