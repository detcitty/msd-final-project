Don't think I'm sorry is what we need to say
Don't think forgiveness is why we're here today
Guilty, we're both guilty, let's walk through that door

A second chance is what I'm talking about
Let's take the hurt and turn it inside out
Lay it on me baby till I can't take anymore

No mercy, show me no mercy
Love me all night long and don't hurry
Take it slow and easy, no mercy tonight
(No mercy, show me no mercy)
