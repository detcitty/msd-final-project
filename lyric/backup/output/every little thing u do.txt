Everything u do just turns me on
Every little thing u do
It turns me on, oh yeah
And every little thing you say
It makes me wanna stay another day, another day
Sexy thing, tell me do
You want to go with me tonight
'Cause in my mind, I see romantic places
Candlelight, champagne on ice
It's the way you move me
It's the way you groove me
It's the way you do me
