Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Yo, yo
Lost generation, fast paced nation
World population confront they frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money makin'
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man? Then stand your own
To emcee requires skills; I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin'
And roam like a cellular phone far from home
Givin' crowds what they wantin'
Official hip-hop consumption, the fifth thumpin'
Keepin' ya party jumpin' with an original somethin'
