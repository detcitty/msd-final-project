We don't believe you 'cause we the people
I'll still be in the rear, yo, we don't need you
You ain't a killer nor good, young nigga, move
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, reliable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make bunnies, she gon' study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain or weather plain, she spit on that
The doors are signed with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you could waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
