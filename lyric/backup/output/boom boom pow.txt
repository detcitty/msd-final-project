Gotta get that
Gotta get that
Gotta get that
Gotta get that that that that that

Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)
Boom boom boom (gotta get that)

Boom boom boom (that)
Boom boom boom (that)
Boom boom boom, boom boom

Yo, I got that hit that beat the block
You can get that bass on below
I got that rock and roll
That future flow

That digital spit
Next-level visual shit
I got that (boom boom boom)
How the beat bang (boom boom boom)

I like that boom boom pow
Them chickens jockin' my style
They try to copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now

I'm so three thousand and eight
You so two thousand and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now
