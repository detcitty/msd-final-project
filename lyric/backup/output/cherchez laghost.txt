tommy mattola, lives on the road
he lost his lady, two months ago
maybe he'll find her, maybe he won't
oh wonder that love
brothers try to pass me, but none could match me
no girl can freak me, i'm just too nasty
lost on the dance floors, i attack y'all
snuck through the back door, guess who they saw?
