You're now tuned in to the motherfuckin' greatest
Turn the music up in the headphones
Tim, you can go and brush your shoulders off nigga'
I got you, yeah

If you feelin' like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy who told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga grippin' my balls
Said the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin' they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin', off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back nigga' cause I'm straight with the Roc
