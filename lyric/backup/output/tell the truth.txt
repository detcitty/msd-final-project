Something about the way, your eyes lately
Look up and down and everywhere but me, yeah
Something about tonight I know is missing
And I know it's more than insecurity, yeah

After all
All the time we've spent together
Don't you think I'd feel something

If I have to read your mind
Well, maybe we're just wasting time
Tell the truth

You know my heart is in your hand
So give it up or make a stand
Or just tell the truth
Come on, tell the truth
