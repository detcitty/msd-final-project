I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down

My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December,
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
