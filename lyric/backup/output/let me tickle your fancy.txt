Like the sun, I rise and shine
With last night on my mind
It's so hard to concentrate
Till our love we recreate

Let me tickle your fancy
Let me excite your soul
Let me tickle your fancy
Let me excite your soul

When I think 'bout us
I get all keyed up
And the tantalizing touch
That I love

Let me tickle your fancy
Let me excite your soul
