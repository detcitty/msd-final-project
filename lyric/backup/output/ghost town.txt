Well the streets are all crowded.
Lots of people around.
And there's music playing,
But I can't hear a sound.
Just the sound of the rain
Falling silently down.
Livin' ain't been livin'
Since you put me down.
Yeah life goes on around me every day,
But it might as well be half a million miles away.
It's like a ghost town without your love.
Like a ghost town without your love.
Like a ghost town, baby, can't you see?
It's a ghost town, until you come back to me.
