Yeah
Well, well, well
Yeah... hey...
Yeah
Hey... hey...
Ooh

Driftin' on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, yeah
Lovin' you, well, well, well

Day will make a way for night
All we'll need is candlelight
And a song, yeah
Soft and long, well, ooh

Glad to be
Here alone with a lover unlike no other
Sad to see
A new horizon slowly comin' into view, yeah

I wanna be livin'
For the love of you, oh, yes, I am
All that I'm givin'
