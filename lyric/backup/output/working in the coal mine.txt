Well I been workin’ in a coal mine
Goin’ down, down
Workin’ in a coal mine
Whew! About to slip down

Well I been workin’ in a coal mine
Goin’ down, down
Workin’ in a coal mine
Whew! About to slip down

Five o’clock in the mornin’
I’m up before the sun
When my work day is over
I’m too tired for havin’ fun

I been workin’ in a coal mine
