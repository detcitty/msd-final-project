If you take a life, do you know what you'll give?
Odds are, you won't like what it is
When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me,
By the merciless eyes I've decieved?

I've seen angels fall from blinding heights
But you yourself are nothing so divine
Just next in line

Arm yourself, because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?
