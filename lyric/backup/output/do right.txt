I know that He
Gave His life for me,
set all our spirits free
So I wanna do right,
Wanna do right
All of my life.

I never dreamed
I could be holding you,
well He's making my dreams come true,
So I wanna do right,
Wanna do right,
I wanna do right.

You've got to do right,
Yes you've got to do right,
And to be your guiding light.
But you've got to do right,
