[Intro:]
Heres a little story I'd like ta tell
About a situation guys and girls know very well
Everything is fine and dandy and you love it
'Til dope make you treat another person like a puppet

[Verse 1:]
Now I talked to this girl for about two weeks
And I've been many places and seen many freaks
But this girl was just fly, her body good lookin
I was a fish just flappin' and she was like hook'n
I got to know her by spending some time
She gave me things of hers for some things of mine
Everything was goin' good, couldn't nothing go better
Anything she wants to do, Hi-C would just let her
Wasn't like them other brothers trying to screw her up
I would take her to the mall, and straight cold do her up
Have a treat, and when she by my side
I want the girl to look good when she rollin' in my ride
But three weeks later I noticed a change
Somethin' wasn't right she was acting kinda strange
Took some money out my stash, and stuffed it in her purse
You think if things is gettin bad, man, it's gonna get worse
Well, looks like I got myself a few problems
But me, being Hi-C, you know I'm gonna solve 'em
She ran out the house, and drove down the street
Stopped to buy some crack from my homeboy Pete
I couldn't believe what I was told
He gave the freak double-up for a thick piece of gold
So I creeped up on on the girl, and said "yeah, I caught ya"
"And by the way, where's the link I bought ya? "
Now this girl must've lost her mind
Scrapping up dough in some things of mine
I wanted to beat her. Better yet stomp her
Break out the 12-gauge and full of buckshot, pump her
But I said, nah forget it, I'm a chill
This girl need help, she's mentally I'll
She got to trip' and started spending my grip!
So I just had to rip the pipe out' her lips
She cried, "Crawf, please gimme some money"
"I promise I'll stop, please, come on Crawf honey! "
I felt sorry for the girl cause she's being misused
It was the crack and the devil, riding to abuse
