Aw...
In the mor-or-ning when she wakes light of dawn come touch her face.
Sunshine keep her warm and safe, wind come blow her tears away.

Tell her love has felt the need to leave her.
Tell her love has felt the need to free her.
I could never be what she wants of me, yeah-eah.

Diamond rings and wedding plans, children laughing and holding hands.
She deserves that kind of man, but my life is like a ship in sand, yeah.
