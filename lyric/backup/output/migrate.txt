Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Keep it moving, bounce
Keep it moving, bounce
Keep it moving, bounce
Keep it moving, bounce

Once again nothing jumping up in your place
Sick of your berry buzzing all in my face
Way too much to tolerate, time to roll
Y'all know I gots to migrate

Speed dial connecting me to Rae-Rae
Click in Shawntae and Mae-Mae
Treat it as a holiday 'cause he's a wrap
Y'all know I had to migrate

See I'm on my way home
'Cause my jeans, yeah, they fit but it might benefit
Me to throw something on to feature my hips
Accentuate my **** and steal the show

As soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbing at us like yo
Trying to get us going off that Patron
We sipping Grigio slow

If your neck and your wrist coordinate
Hair braided or faded okay
We can move this back to my place
It's time to migrate

From my car into the club, we migrate
