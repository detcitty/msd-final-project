Girl I got you so high
And I know you like
So come and push it on me
If it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind (aight)
She doesn't mind (aight)
She doesn't mind.

Girl I got you so!

Push it back pon it, bring it back pon it
Gimme di ting becah mi waah fi lock pon it
Wine it, wiggle it, set di track pon it
Two more shot, now we inna hot pon it
Two girl, and dem ready fi jump pon it
Two to my world, and mi ready fi tump pon it
Ready fi run pon it, ready fi dump pon it
Tag teaming fiyah truck mi pump on it

Hands up high, we burning up the sky
We got the dance hall crazy
Got the club on fire
I like the way you dance
You got me in a trance
My baby she don't mind at all...
