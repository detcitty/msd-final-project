Since you been gone
I feel my life slipping away
I look to the sky
And everything is turnin' gray

All I made was one mistake
How much more will I have to pay
Why can't you think it over
Why can't you forget about the past

When love makes this sound babe
A heart needs a second chance
Don't put me down babe
Can't you see I love you

Since you been gone, I've been in a trance
This heart needs a second chance
Don't say it's over
I just can't say goodbye

So this is love
Standing in the pouring rain
