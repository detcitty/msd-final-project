I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
Each other again
I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
Each other again

Let's not say goodbye
Let's just say so long
It didn't work out this time, girl
Chances are that we'll get it on

Cause I've got a world of faith
That we're gonna make it someday
Some other time and situation
I know we can form a
Stronger relation

Cause I've got a feeling
That we'll be seeing
