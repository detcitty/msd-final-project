Aye, oh, there it is, there it is, there it is
There it is, there it is (Rich Homie, baby!)

Walked in 30, 000 in my pocket
Had them niggas just like oh, ooh, ooh
15, 000 dollars on your bitch wanna fuck me
Got her screamin' like oh, ooh, ooh
Cause I got a check, nigga wanna flex
Ain't gotta flex but I got it, oh, ooh, ooh
Give that ho some x, she gone wanna sex every nigga in the set
And now she screamin' like oh, ooh, ooh

Made some million dollars off a mixtape
And I'm fuckin' like, ooohhh
They try to drop me with a case but you know I had to skate it
I was singing like, oooohhh
Boy I know my role and I play it
