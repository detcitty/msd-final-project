You know sometimes I sit and wonder
Just how this world would be
If we had all the people laughing
And everybody living in harmony

We have to say se la, se la
Talking to the people
Se la, se la
It's time you thought about it
Se la, se la (hey, hey)
Se la, se la

There would be no more living in desperation
And no more hatred and deceit
Tell me can you imagine
All the children playing
And everyone dancing in the street

We se la, se la, se la
Do it, say it
Se la, se la
