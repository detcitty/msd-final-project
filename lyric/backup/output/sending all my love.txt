Girl I close my eyes
And then I start to cry for you
You're the reason why
I have to say goodbye to you
This pain I have inside
Just makes me want to die for you
All these lonely nights
They just don't seem so right for you
I'm sending you all my
Sending all my love
I'm sending all my love to you
I'm sending all my love
