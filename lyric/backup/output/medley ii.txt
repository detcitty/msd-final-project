Come! that's light!
Let's do it! Let's do it!

You gotta beat the clock
You gotta beat the clock

Uhuhuh uh uhuh uh uhuh uhuh
Uhuhuh uh uhuh uh uhuh uhuh
Uhuhuh uh uhuh uh uhuh uhuh
Uhuhuh uh uhuh uh uhuh uhuh

You can boogie like disco
Love that disco sound
Move all your body
Spin it all around
But don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't forget, oh no
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't forget, oh no no no

The Stars on '45
Keep on turning in your mind
Like "We Can Work it Out"
Remember "Twist and Shout"
You still don't "Tell Me Why" and "No Reply"

That's light, that's light!
You gotta beat the clock
You gotta beat the clock

But don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't forget

Uhuhuh uh uhuh uh uhuh uhuh
