I've been livin in this lonely world
wishin I could find someone to love
hopin someone would come from above
change my life...

yeaaaah

(bridge)
then I noticed you there
you were my angel sent from my despair
I know that you are the lady who cares
whoa yeah yeaah

(chorus)
I wanna spend my life with you
