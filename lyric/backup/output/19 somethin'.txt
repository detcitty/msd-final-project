I saw Star Wars at least 8 times
Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff they put inside,
Stretch Armstrong
Yeah

I was Roger Staubach back in my back yard
Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evil Kinevil scars
On my right arm
Well, I was a kid when Elvis died
And my mama cried

It was 1970-something
In the world that I grew up in
