(PA)
It's the middle of the day
And we both have thrown a fit
The tv is on
But neither one of us is watching it
Now your problem is
Everytime my pager go off
I don't pay it no mind
And my problem is
Everytime the phone rings
You go get it and you run and hide
Now if it's two people in between us that don't exist
And we're both gonna go on lying
Ain't nothin' good about thatÂ ? baby
We're both guilty of a John Doe crime

(PA)(Lele)
Who was that guy who paged you?
(I don't know)
Who was that guy that waved at you?
(I don't know)
Who was that guy who called you?
(I don't know)
Who was that guy I saw you with?
(I don't know)
How did you get some extra money?
(Uh, don't know)
When I needed some you told me
(I don't know)
Is this love affair over?
(Uh, don't know)
Tell me a name
(John Doe)
