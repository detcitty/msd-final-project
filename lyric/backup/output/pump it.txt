Come on and sit over here and let me tell you a little bed time story

Pick up on me, Pick up on me, Pick up on me, Pick up on me

Rollin' into town, I'm down, for an evenin' of dancin'
A little chit-chat and lots of who's zat
And several invitin' glances (pick up on me)
Walked into the club, people were jammin' 'cause the base was thumpin'
I was standin' on the side with my home girl, Shirl
My body all set to get pumpin' (nice 'n' hard)
