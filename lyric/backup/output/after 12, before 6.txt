I heard the phone ring, it's you
Telling me all I do is neglect you
The first thing that I wanna say
You know I've been working hard and all day, baby

I don't trip on what your friends say
'Cause you know they all want me anyway
You know that I'll be true to you
My love can't start until, oh love

After 12, before 6
I want you all up in my mix
I wanna make love to you
All night long
