All my life I've been alone but I've never really cared
Just a face inside a crowd, a stranger everywhere
Everyone I've ever known has disappointed me
I live and breathe only for me

No one's ever been inside the walls surrounding me
I depend on me myself to keep me company
No one cares about me so, I take good care of me
I'm in a world all of my own
