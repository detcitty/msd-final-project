I've been trying for hours just to think of what exactly to say
I thought I'd leave you with a letter or fiery speech
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play

And I've been dying for hours trying to fill up all the holes with some sense
I'd like to know how you faded and you threw it away
I'd like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant

Well I could tell you goodbye or maybe see you around
With just a touch of a sarcastic thanks
We started out with a bang and at the top of the world
Now the guns are exhausted and the bullets are blanks
And everything's blank

CHORUS:
If I could find the words then I would write it all down
If I could only find a voice I would speak
