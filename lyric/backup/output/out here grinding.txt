DJ Khaled, we the best season has returned
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
I do this for the streets, the runners
(Cause I'm out here grindin')

I don't care what nobody say
I'm a be me
(Be me)
Stay hood stay raised in the streets
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
Niggaz talking about greatness
Whenever they speak about me
(Cause I'm out here grindin')

I ain't splitting nothing with nobody homie
I gotta get me me
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't slept in 8 days
I can go for 8 weeks
Ain't nothing to me cause I am the streets

Put my life on the line
But I'm likely to grind
I'm on top of the game
Fuck if you like it or not

Ask how I get the freaks
Strawberry swishy fresh
You'll be dealing with H
When you dealing with G's

Flashing deal with the realest
Shopping like it's still December
Diplomat on the fender of the Phantom
I'm the winner

I do it for the hood
I do it cause you can't
You suckers wish you could
Ricky Ross is in the bank

Guess who? Guess what?
Under investigation, so what?
Come through, doors up
Lil cool water, watch em freeze up

Look ma, got a new car
Should be proud of your son
He a trapstar
Say none of you expensive
That's what a gold man told me
Don't care what nobody say
I got a hundred, don't call me

I don't care what nobody say
I'm a be me
