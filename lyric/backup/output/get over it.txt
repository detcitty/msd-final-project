We got another brand new song for you
This our anti politically correct song
It's kinda one of these kind of songs
That's what we get for watching afternoon television
This song is called get over it
I turn on the tube what do I see
A whole lot a people cryin' don't blame me
They point their crooked little fingers at everybody else
Spend all their time feelin' sorry for themselves
Victim of this victim of that
Your mama's too thin and your daddy's too fat
Get over it
