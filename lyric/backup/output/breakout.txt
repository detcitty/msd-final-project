And breakout

When explanations makes no sense
When every answer's wrong
You're fighting with lost confidence
All expectations gone

The time has come to make or break
Move on, don't hesitate
And breakout

Don't stop to ask
And now you've found a break to make it last
You've got to find a way
Say what you want to say
Breakout

When situations never change
