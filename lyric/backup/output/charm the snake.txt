(Christopher Cross/Michael Omartian)

You gotta be smart
You gotta be cool
You gotta keep a straight face
When you're playin' the fool
You gotta wear a smile
When you're breakin' the rules
You gotta charm that snake now, baby

You gotta be smooth
You gotta be quick
I think it might just help
To be a little bit sick
You know the bite can't cut you
If the skin is thick
Charm that snake now, baby

Hey, we ain't all good lookin'
There ain't no reason
To take a good lickin'
The clock on the wall
