(Eric Woolfson - Lead Vocal)
(Alan Parsons/Eric Woolfson)

Well, even the longest night
Won't last forever
But too many hopes and dreams
Won't see the light
And all of the plans I make
Won't come together

Something in the air
(Something in the air)
Maybe for the only time in my life
Something in the air
