Mmmmmmm, Yeah
Oooooh
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh Oh Oh Oh
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high

It feels like a dream

When you touch me tenderly

I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of

Oh Oh Oh Oh
