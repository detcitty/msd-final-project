Mama doesn't like when I sin so well
Heaven's kinda far
But I swear that when I'm coming, it's close
'Cause we sin so well

Lead us not into temptation
Oh, but what a way to go

Oh, my flesh has got control of me
I'm human and by nature, weak
'Cause humans make it hard to be so holy

Oh angels, close your eyes to this
My conscience can't compete with him
Yes, I'm losing, please forgive me

Mama doesn't like when I sin so well
Heaven's kinda far
But I swear that when I'm coming, it's close
'Cause we sin so well

Lead us not into temptation
