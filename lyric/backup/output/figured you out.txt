I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While you're looking up at me

You're like my favourite damn disease
And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say no

Too many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out

(Now I did, you wonder why)
