There's a few million angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again
I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name, I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify, he's right by my side
I believe it be His word is so clear to me
Yeah, yeah

All I want is 100 million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status

All I wanted was 100 million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
