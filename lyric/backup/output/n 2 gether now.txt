DJ Mia
Uhh, uhh, uhh

Who can be the boss?
Look up to the Cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin up, I'm sideways
I'm blazin' up the path
Runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
Lava stamps and brands me like a barcode
I'm dashin' all the media strikes, keep the media dykes
As re enforcements for the fight
And that alone will keep John Gotti on the phone
Yea

Tangled in his own
I got the Bees on the track
Where the fuck you at?
(Tical)
Let me hear you pigeons run your mouth now
(Shut the fuck up)
I'm pluggin' in them social skills
That keep my total bills over a million
The last time I checked it
Thank God I'm blessed with the mind that I wreck it
Wait until the second round
I'll knock him out

They call me Big John Stud
My middle name Mud
Dirty water flow
Too much for you thugs
That can't stand the flood
What up doc?
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd, the sure shot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged
(Plugged)
Learn
Temperature's too hot for sunblock
(Burn)

Playin' with minds can get you state time
Lock behind twelve bars from a great mind
Killa Bees in the club when there's ladybug
Brought a sword to tha dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day 'til they both slug
And take another life in cold blood
Can't feel me?
'Cause it's your blood
Murder is tremendous, crime is endless
Same shit different day
Father forgive us, they know not what they do, our praises do
I'm big like easy, ya big bamboo
