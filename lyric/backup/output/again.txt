I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me
In my mind

How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again

A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did
