Baby, your love it surrounds me but never gives me half a chance
I need a little heart infection 'cause love needs a little romance
And we'll never ever make it if you're pushin' me
You gotta back up baby or I might leave
You gotta show me, hold me and let love breathe tonight

Give me the right kind of love, oh baby
Give me the right kind of love
