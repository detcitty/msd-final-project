I hear he's out there
Somewhere
Been looking for him everywhere
From Roswell to Timbuktu
I thought I found him once at a Jiffy Lube
But it turned in
To a dead end
So I got my oil changed and I tried again
He was a major in archaeology
I was digging on him but he wasn't on me
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
