Girl I must have been crazy to say that it was over
I had to be a fool to yell out we were through
And now I'm all alone and feeling down and out baby
When I never meant for this to end, it was so so crazy of me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby, bring your lovin' back to me

I can't sleep babe, I can't think babe, I can't live babe
