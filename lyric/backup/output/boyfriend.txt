Ha, Ha, Ha,
Ha, Ha, Ha,

Whatcha been doin'?
Whatcha been doin?
Whoa, Whoa,
Haven't seen ya 'round,

How you been feelin'?
How you been feelin'?
Whoa, whoa,
Don't you bring me down,

All that shit about me,
Being with him,
Can't believe,
All the lies that you told,
Just to ease your own soul,
But I'm bigger than that,
No, you don't have my back,
No, No, HA

Hey, how long till the music drowns you out?
