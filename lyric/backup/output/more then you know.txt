There's a fire in my eyes
It should come as no surprise to you
If I've shown you once or twice
How I feel it's because it's the truth
You know that it's true

Wanted to tell you so many times
How I feel when you're with me
Now that I've found you
I know that you are my destiny

I-I-I love you more than you know
This feeling's so strong inside
I won't let you go
(I'm)
Afraid to show it
'Cuz I don't wanna blow it
(Blow it)
I love you more than you know

You know you've got me hypnotized
That's something I should hide from you
If I feel so mesmerized
