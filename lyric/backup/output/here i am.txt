I got a bunch of dollars
I can spend them on her
Cause she can be my lady,
She can be my lover
Call me on the late night,
Get right he ain't acting right
Every super woman needs a super man
Here I am

Sight seeing we might be in the
Codra port or that new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face,
Next semester she transfer to Florida state
Cooking like home-etch for financial aid.
I highly doubt she has problems with financial aid .
Remember mean time my finance is straight
I even open up the doors to the panantial states Boss
She used to fight with her moms,
Till I sat em both down
Now she's tight with her moms (what?)
Yeah I put the ice on her arm,
Now she know she getting sliced
Spending nights in Milan (yeah)
We still blow weed together,
Cheated on her but we still gone be together
With the house on the water hit the beach whenever
She's from the north and still can't believe there whether Boss
