There's a dream in my soul
a fire that's deep inside me
There's a me no one knows
waiting to be set free.

I'm gonna see that day
I can feel it
I can taste it
Change is coming my way

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lighting
I'm gonna rise above
show 'em what I'm made of
