I can remember when we had, we had it all
You and I, You and I
You know, you know we had it all
You and I
Reminisce

(Verse 1)
I know that we've been here before
The candle light and you walking softly through my door
Come on in my sweet. How have you been?
Your so nice but tonight we're gonna be more than just friends
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we shared each other
Dont you feel the magic, the mystery's in the air
Lets go down to lover's lane with the love we shared
