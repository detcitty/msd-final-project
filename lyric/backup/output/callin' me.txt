I live the life of a celebrity
A made figga way bigger than them other cats you love to see
I'm getting paid like I'm supposed to
My homies call me on my mobile wanna hang we still close too
I switched positions with them cold cats
I write raps, make millions like that
I like that (hey yeah) really never was a rich man
A rubber band for a wrist band
Got dough and had to switch plans
Trouble still don't stop
The freeway getting chased by some bad missies
Wanting autographed pictures (oohh)
They want my name tattooed on them
Thinkin for a minute hit that ass make a move on them
Hey! Hennessey with the chardonnay, mix it
I put the trees in the Garcay, twist it (whooaa yeah)
