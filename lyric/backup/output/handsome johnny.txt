Hey, look yonder, tell me what's that you see
marching to the fields of concord?
it looks like handsome johnny with a musket in his hand,
marching to the concord war, hey marching to the concord war.

hey, look yonder, tell me what you see
marching to the fields of gettysburg?
it looks like handsome johnny with a flintlock in his hand,
marching to the gettysburg war, hey marching to the gettysburg war.
