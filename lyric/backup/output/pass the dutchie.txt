This generation
Rules the nation
With version

Music happen to be the food of love
Sounds to really make you rub and scrub
(Dum dum ba dum biddly biddly biddly biddly bum)
I say, pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side

It a gonna burn
(Give me music, make me jump and prance)
It a go done
(Give me the music, make me rock in the dance)
It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)

So I left my gate and went out for a walk
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I heard them say
(How does it feel when you've got no food?)
Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
(I say)

Pass the Dutchie pon the left hand side
It a gonna burn
