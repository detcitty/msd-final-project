Black silk on satin skin
It's late at night and it's hot as sin
We're gonna make it
Get hotter yet
And a rockin' chair
I'm gonna show you why I put it there
To build a rhythm
You won't forget
We got the chemistry to make the fantasy become reality
You've got the attitude to put me in the mood
Ooh la la la

I said (ooh la la)
Baby do that (ooh la la)
I really love your (ooh la la)
