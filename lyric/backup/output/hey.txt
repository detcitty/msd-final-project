I'm counting the days since I began to live without you
I'm covered in rain but it feels just like it's the sun
And it don't get me down, don't come around
You're better off leaving town
I'm fine here alone now without you

Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better alone
Hey!
I'm screaming at you
Hey!
Don't care enough to write you a letter now that I'm doing better,
