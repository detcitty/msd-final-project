When you light those candles
Up there on that mantle
Setting the mood

Well, I just lie there staring
Silently preparing
To love on you

Well, I can feel the heat
From across the room
Ain't it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do

I melt
Every time you look at me that way

It never fails
Anytime, any place
