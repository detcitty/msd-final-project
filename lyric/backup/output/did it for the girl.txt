I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a hair cut
Ironed up a pearl snap
Left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash

I did it for the girl
Dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
