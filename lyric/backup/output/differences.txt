Oh, hey...
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
To you
Mmm... mmm... mmm...

Oh, yeah, babe
My whole life has changed
Since you came in, I knew back then
You were that special one

I'm so in love, so deep in love
You make my life complete
You are so sweet, no one competes
Glad you came into my life

You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight
Girl, you open me, I'm wide open
And I'm doing things I never do
But I feel so good, I feel so good

Why'd it take so long, finding you
This is my story and I'm telling you
It's not fiction, it's surely a fact
Without you right here having my back
