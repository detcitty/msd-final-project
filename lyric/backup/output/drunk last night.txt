I got a little drunk last night
There's something 'bout a midnight rain
Staring at the ceiling fan
I couldn't get you off my brain

I guess I wasn't thinking straight
I couldn't tell wrong from right
I went ahead and called you up
I got a little drunk last night

I brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth, to both of us now
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, keep that hurt,
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last the last time every time
