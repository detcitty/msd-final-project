Tell me what do you see
When you looking at me, oh
On a mission to be
What I'm destined to be, oh, yeah

I done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above, yeah

All the above, oh
All the above, oh, all the above, oh, oh
All the above, oh, all the above, oh
All the above, oh, oh, all the above

Listen, really what do you see when you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing to me living my dreams
I done been to the bottom, I done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich, headed straight to the top

Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I get nothing but love now when I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money ain't going to shame
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain

How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
