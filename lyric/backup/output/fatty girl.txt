Na na na gonna have a good time
Na na na gonna have a good time
Hey hey hey

[Ludacris]
Yo, girl you taste like a cinnabun
So sweet from the thighs to the cheek
Sex on the beach check the size of my meat
Call me the pusher ludacris king ding-a-ling sheet smusher
Sweet street pusher give me that gusher. nasty stuff
Looker I took her.ran out of liquor... (time to re-up)
Here comes her nigga (who give's a fuck)
Rap fame and plat thangs they can't hang
I mack dames and pack thangs and act strange
Jang-a-ling dang-a-ling oh no they can't stop
Take it to the floor back up and then drop
Effervescent. time times of the essence
Make em undress in less then 3 seconds
So whore's keep steppin whore's keep slobbin
Sex as a weapon clothes that I slept in streets keep mobbin
Thieves keep robbin get two in yo butt three to yo noggin
Creepin and crawlin I'm incogneg
can't catch the balls then you in the wrong league
