I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, "Where you been?"
He said, "Ask anything."

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang

And all I needed was a call

That never came
