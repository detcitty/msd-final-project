I'm leaving messages and voicemails
Telling you I miss you
Baby am I doing too much (too much)
Why you tryna diss me
When I just wanna kiss you
Baby am I doing too much (too much)
Tell me what's the issue
Who I give these lips to
Baby am I doing too much (too much)
This is turning into
Something I ain't hip to
Baby am I doing too much (too much)
See you got me all alone
Waiting right here by the phone
For you to call me
Just to hear
Your voice tone
I keep on wondering if you was even
Feeling me, I keep on wondering if
This was even meant to be
Tell me imma waste of time, boy
You showing me no sign, is it cuz u on
Ya grind, cuz you're always on my mind
I keep on wondering if everything you said was true
I keep on wondering if you were really coming through
Now here I go again blowing you up
And my girlfriends keep telling me
I'm doing too much
Now here I go again blowing you up
