Seen you last night
Saw you standin' there
And couldn't picture the color of your hair
And all I wanted to know, were you really there?

I wanna know, was it my imagination
Ooh, you know it was a sweet sensation
Lookin' at you from a distance
Ooh, it seems so real

You and I together
Dream that seemed for real
If it's a dream, please don't wake me up
It feels so real, all I know is

I want her
(I want that baby)
I want her
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
I want her
(I wanna do it like this, do it like that)
I want her
(Once I get it ain't no turnin' back)

You turn me on and on
This feelin' girl is so strong
My heart, girl, is on fire
Ooh, you're my desire

I've got a thing for you
Dreams of you and me, baby
She's bad, she's bad, she's bad
All I know is

I want her
