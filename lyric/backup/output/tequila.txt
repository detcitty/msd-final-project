(feat. The Lost Civilization)

[VERSE 1]
I was at the bar with my drinking team
And it was me, Jack Daniels and my homie Jim Beam
We were kinda blizzed and we were tryin to behave, yo
When in walked a soldier, he was from the Fuzzy Navel
We were fallin, stumblin, crawlin
In came the police, Captain Tom Collins
And the vato said, "Freeze!" (Freeze!)
He said, "Hands in the air and hand over your keys"
Now we did, and that was kinda simple
Now here came Margarita and her friend Shirley Temple
I asked my friend 'bout Margarita
He said that Shirley was a virgin and I wouldn't wanna meet her
So I talked to Margarita, cause, yo, she was flyer
I took her to the couch, cause I wanted to srew-drive her
Now I'm not one for a speech
But there was plenty of Tequila and Sex on the Beach
Y'all
Tequila

[horn section plays the 'Tequila' theme]

T-T-T-Tequila

Yeah
