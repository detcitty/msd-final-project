You're my painted picture
You fill my life with color
You're my painted picture
You're the one that I adore

Loving you comes easy
I'll never try to change you
You're my inspiration
You're the one I'm living for

You know, girl, looking at you
Makes my life so complete
And you have a way of
Looking at me right back
That makes me feel?

Look into my eyes, my love
And tell a story
They are just a window to my soul

I can see the beauty
That is rare and precious
You're worth more to me
Than any man's gold

Girl, you have a way of blinding me
