Yeah, never thoughts of suicide I’m too alive
But I still treat it likes it’s do or die
Even though dying isn’t in the plans, 
but neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight’s no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah’s precious life go too soon, 
she deserve the credit for how I’m about to get it
That’s why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn man she’s beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain’t had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here, the girls here?
Well fuck let’s get it then

I’m trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double?
