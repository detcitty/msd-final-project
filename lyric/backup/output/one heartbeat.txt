Ooh baby, oh-ah, uh-huh
Two hearts, two of a kind
Love at first sight
Why do they say love is blind?

Slow down
We don't have to move fast
'Cause the love that is real
Is made to last

Take it one heartbeat
At a time
Close your eyes
And let your soul unwind

Sooner or later
It'll all fall in line
If we take it
One heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

Oooh
