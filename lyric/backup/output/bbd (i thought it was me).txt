[Verse: Ricky Bell]
I went out, last niiiiiiiight
See, that's when I met a sexy girl
She was lookin' so riiiiiiiiiiight
She said, "I wanna take you for a trip around the world"
And by the look in her eyes, ho
The girl was serious!
She wore no disguise, oh no.
So let's have some fun, yeah!
[Chorus:]
(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me who makes the girl this way
(I thought it was me) - I came to find out she's like that every day
(I thought it was me) - I thought it was me that makes that girl so wild
(I thought it was me) - I found out she's like that with all the guys
[Michael Bivins:]
Yo, I love bein a bachelor
Ricky said, "Yo, that girl's a good catch for ya"
She and I choose to cruise in my love boat
My waterbed, kept us afloat
I had to prove my manhood
