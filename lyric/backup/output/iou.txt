Featuring Nikeeta

Tell me that you love me every day
When we're alone
I really feel the love

But when we're out with friends
I see you change
You treat me bad
I feel like second best

I want your love
(I want your love)
Give me your love, boy
(Give me your love)
That's how I feel and
I want it to be real

I want your love
(I want your love)
Give me your love, boy
(Give me your love)
I need your touch and I
I.O.U you so much
