Sometimes in my bed at night
I curse the dark and I pray for light
And sometimes, the light's no consolation

Blinded by a memory
Afraid of what it might do to me
And the tears and the sweat
Only mock my desperation

Don't you know me
I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fighting for?

Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line
Labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city
