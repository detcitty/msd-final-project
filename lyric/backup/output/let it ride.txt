Goodbye, I lied
Don't cry, would you let it ride?
Goodbye, I lied
Don't cry, would you let it ride?

You can see the mornin', but I can see the light
Try, try, try, let it ride
While you've been out runnin', I've been waitin' half the night
Try, try, try, let it ride

And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
And would you say goodbye or would you let it ride?
And would you cry if I told you that I lied?
