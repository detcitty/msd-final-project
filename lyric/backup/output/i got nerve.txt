We haven't met, and that's okay
'Cause you will be asking for me one day

Don't want to wait in line
The moment is mine believe me

Don't close your eyes
Cause it's a chance worth takin
And I think that I can show you

I know where I stand
I know who I am
I would never run away when life gets bad
Everything I see
Every part of me
Gonna get what I deserve
I got nerve!

Electrified, I'm on a wire
Gettin' together and we're on fire
What I said, you heard
Now I've got you spinning

Don't close your mind
The words I use are open
And I think that I can show you
