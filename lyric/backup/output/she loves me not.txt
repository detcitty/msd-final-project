When I see her eyes
Look into my eyes
And I realize
That she could see inside my head
So I closed my eyes
Thinking that I could hide

Dissassociate so I don't have to Lose my head

This situation leads to agitation
Will she cut me off

Will this be an amputation

I don't know
If I care
I'm the jerk

Life's not fair

Fighting all the time
This is out of line

She loves me not

Loves me not
Do you realize
I won't compromise
She loves me not
