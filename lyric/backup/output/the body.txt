Baby you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just tryna drive it once again
Baby you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just tryna drive it once again

Shawty can I be your tank, yeah
I start of with that "What you drinkin'?"
Pardon if I'm road raging
But I know you heard my drive is crazy
Yeah, let me pace that, with some patience
Let me do it till I fill every void
You're like a Maybach, thinking damn, they ain't even make 'em like you no more
It's like a high beam gleaming through your eye (bling)
I can door you up, baby suicide
A little wordplay, I'm hoping I can make you smile
Least until I'm out of line like a DUI
Girl you remind me of my Jeep
Can I see what's up with that G-Wagon
Can I take you off of these streets
To the side of me, I'm tryna see your hazards
Tryna be with the baddest, won't be the fastest
Gotta make it last, I hope you comfortable
I need to get to you, you're like a 62
