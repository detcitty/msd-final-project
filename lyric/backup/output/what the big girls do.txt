She's got her eye on an older guy
Tired of being treated like a kid
Her friends keep saying she better act her age
But he'd never notice her if she did
She paints her eyes and colors her cheeks
Slides her nylons up her legs
She's going to wrap his love her little finger
And squeeze til the poor boy begs

She wants to do what the big girls do
Ready to try anything new
