(Bill Anderson - Bob Talbert)

Where have all our heroes gone
What's come over our great land
America is still my home sweet home
But where have all our heroes gone?

I saw a group of boys the other day
Standing in the corner of a playground
Looking and laughin' at a magazine
And I overheard one of the boys
Said man is he ever cool
And he pointed to the man
Who's picture was on the magazine cover
And everybody kinda said under their breath
Yeah, he's cool alright.

And I got sick to my stomach
Because I'd seen the cover
And the man that they were talking about
Had instigated a riot in one of our major cities last summer
And the magazine was writing
About how the police were unkind to him
The judges were not fair with him
And how he talked back and slung
