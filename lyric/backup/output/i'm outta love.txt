Ooh, oh, whoa
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah

Oh yeah, aha
Now, baby, come on
Don't claim that love you never let me feel
I should have known
'Cause you've brought nothing real
Come on, be a man about it
You won't die
I ain't got no more tears to cry
And I can't take this no more
You know I gotta let it go

And you know
I'm outta love
Set me free
And let me out this misery!
Just show me the way to get my life again
'Cause you can't handle me
Said I'm outta love
Can't you see
Baby, that you gotta set me free?
