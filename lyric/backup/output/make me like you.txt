Ah, ah ah ah ah, ah
I was fine before I met you
I was broken but fine
I was lost and uncertain
But my heart was still mine
I was free before I met you
I was broken but free
All alone in a clear view
But now you are all I see

Hey, wait a minute
No, you can't do this to me
Hey, wait a minute
No, that's not fair
Hey, wait a minute
You're on me like jewelry
I really like it
But I'm so scared

Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
This is a feeling I'm not used to
Ooh, why'd you have to go and make me like you?
I'm so mad at you
Cause now you got me missing you
