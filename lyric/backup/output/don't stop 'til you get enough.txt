You make me feel like -
You, you make me feel like -

Lovely
Is the feelin' now
Fever
Temperature's risin' now
Power (ah power)
Is the force, the vow
That makes it happen
It asks no questions why (ooh)
Get closer (closer now)
To my body now

Just love me
'til you don't know how (ooh)

Keep on
With the force, don't
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on
With the force, don't

Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on
