Y-y-y-yeah

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Yeah, home of the party and the trees
Sunny la-land of the G's
Please let a nigga breathe
Tank top top down for the breeze
Burnt lips, got a blunt full of weed
Peace, love, enemies
Nigga I ain't come for the beef
You ain't know she came for the skeet?
Got pipe for the cheeks
Nigga, I'm the life of the beat
Fuck that bitch, she ain't gotta eat
B-bounce for the crown
You be hating and I still hold it down
When you round man the girls never lounge
Man I heard you a hound
Bruh man, that bitch need a pound
Tip, tip, tip bounce out her gown
