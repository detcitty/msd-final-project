Please baby can’t you see
My mind’s a burnin’ hell
I got razors a rippin’ and tearin’ and strippin’
My heart apart as well
Tonight you told me
That you ache for something new
And some other woman is lookin’ like something
That might be good for you

Go on and hold her till the screaming is gone
Go on believe her when she tells you nothing’s wrong

But I’m the only one
Who’ll walk across the fire for you
And I’m the only one
Who’ll drown in my desire for you
