Sing it out
Boy, you got to see what tomorrow brings
Sing it out
Girl, you got to be what tomorrow needs
For every time
That they want to count you out
Use your voice
Every single time you open up your mouth

Sing it for the boys
Sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart
Sing it till you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf
Sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world
Sing it for the world

Sing it out
