I worked so hard to get me a man
Don t try to take him away
I love my man like nobody can
Don t try or you re gonna pay

You ve been gettin too close, you ve been goin too far
Who do you think you are
Some kind of star

You re headin for a red light
Hot light
Red Fight
Dynomite

Red light
Hot light
Red Fight
Dynomite

Red light (Red s the color of hot)
Hot night (Hot's the fever I got)
Red Fight (Red enough it could burn you)
Ooh

Red light (Red is all I can see)
Hot light (Hot is how it ll be)
Red Fight (Red for you if you must be free)
Ooh

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Now I dont want you hangin around
My man is too hot to hold
