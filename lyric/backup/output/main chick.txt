I told her fuck that nigga

Mustard on the beat ho

I don't know your name, but you've heard my name
I know why you came...
Tryna get that name, but you've heard my name
Girl I know you wanna be my main chick, my main chick
I said fuck whoever you came with, who you came with
I told her Fuck that nigga

We sitting in the back of the club
Table got a rope in the front (I don't know ya)
You looking real familiar, I could just be a lil' drunk
I don't know your name, it's a goddamn shame
I don't know how to explain it for ya
But, girl, I'm just saying
If you got a man back home, I don't know him
What, just keep it on the hush
Pocket full of trees, don't beat around the bush
