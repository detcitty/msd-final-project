Sing a happy song, sing a happy song
Why don't you sing along, sing a happy song
Get on up and dance, sing a happy song
Come on clap your hands, sing a happy song

Music's good for your soul
It can bring a real good feelin'
Good for the young and old
Brighten up the darkest day, oh

It can be your release
It can supply you with peace
Some peace of mind
Why don't you

Sing a happy song, sing a happy song (Sing)
Why don't you sing along, sing a happy song (Why don't you)
Why don't you dance awhile (Dance, dance), sing a happy song
Come on get involved, sing a happy song

Can't you feel, feel the beat
Go ahead and pat your feet and
Let the rhythm take control
Move your body from side to side, oh
