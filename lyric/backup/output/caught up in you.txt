I never knew there'd come a day
When i'd be sayin' to you
"don't let this good love slip away
Now that we know that it's true."
Don't, don't you know the kind of man i am
No, said i'd never fall in love again
But it's real and the feeling comes shining through.

So caught up in you, little girl
And i never did suspect a thing
So caught up in you, little girl
That i never want to get myself free
And baby it's true
You're the one
Who caught me baby you taught me
