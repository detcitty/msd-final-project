(So special girl, So special)
(So special girl, So special)

Uh, boy shorts, wife beater
Now let me see it, I'm a sightseer
She was sleeping on me, but she's a light sleeper
I make her cum first, then I follow the leader
I talk shit, I hope it matters
We climax, without the ladder
Can't desert the future, no Nevada
Her body is a weapon, ratatat her
I spent the night in heaven, I slept with an angel
And when we finish, I swear that pussy said, "thank you"
I said, "Your Very Welcome". I'm so well mannered
And I go down south, Louisiana

Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
