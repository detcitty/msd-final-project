Waking up, half past five
Blood on pillow, and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should've seen the other guy
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
o Baby I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles that's why

In my dark time I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time
