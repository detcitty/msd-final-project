Hell no I don't wanna holla at no motherfuckin Trick
He all over there smelling like boonk and Hennesey and shit
Hell no

I'm saying though
What you got a playa back there just trying to say what's up

Hell no
I don't wanna holla at him
That's alright

Hold up bitch
Hold up bitch
Hold up hoe
Check it out

Hoe you don't know nann nigga uh-uh
That'll represent like me
Who'll say some shit like me
One who'll lay the dick like me
Bitch you don't know nann nigga uh-uh
Who do the shit that I do
Run through yo whole lil' crew
Pay for it if I got to
Hoe you don't know nann nigga uh-uh
That'll run off in yo house
Put the gun off in yo mouth
Blow yo motherfucking brains out
Bitch you don't know nann nigga uh-uh
Who'll fall off in the club
Free drinks for the show some love
Take the bar home for the thugs
Bitch you don't know nann nigga uh-uh
Who know mo' niggas than me
Who do mo' killings than me
And weigh mo' dope dealings than me
