Don't even think about callin' me crazy
You know you peeped that lady, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And when I turned and look at you, you tried
To play it off but I can tell that you two were friends (ah)
She was just too nervous
She was lookin' like she was hurt
Like the memory had surfaced (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It kinda got her pissed (Yeah, yeah)
I'm kinda wonderin' myself
And your really no help
Tell me how you two know each other so well (Yeah, yeah)
Cause I wanna know now (Yeah)
You better start talkin' (Yeah, yeah)

Who is she to you (Yeah)
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you
My eyes can see
