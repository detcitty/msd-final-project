It's time for you to strike back
They're lookin' at you
Whitney Houston
Muhammad 2 G
They're watching your every move

Bobby

They're watching you

Why you lookin' at me
Don't get mad at me
'Cause I'm still gonna be me
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)
Whatchulookinat
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)
Whatchulookinat
I feel your eyes on me
You been telling lies on me
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)
Whatchulookinat
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)

See I don't understand
Why you keep peepin' me
When you don't even like me
You're after me and my man
Don't think you're stressing me
'Cause your lies don't excite me, no no

(Never thought)
Never thought, Never thought
(Never knew)
Never knew that you would do this to me
Do this to me
(Try to ruin me) Ruin me
(Be my enemy) Be my enemy
(Never thought)
Never thought, Never thought, Never thought
(That you) That you
Would act as if you're cool with me
So why you lookin' at me

Why you lookin' at me
(Don't get mad at me)
