Standing in line
To see the show tonight
And there's a light on
Heavy glow

By the way I tried to say
I'll be there
Waiting for

Dani the girl
Is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee
Overload

Steak-knife
Card shark
Con job
Boot cut

Skin that flick
She's such a little DJ
Get there quick
By street but not the freeway

Turn that trick
To make a little leeway
Beat that nic
But not the way that we play

Dog town
Blood bath
Rib cage
Soft tail

Standing in line
