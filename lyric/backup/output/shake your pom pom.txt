I see you got low
And you got plenty more to show, go
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom
Shake it like a pom pom, like a pom pom

Go, like you tryna win a contest for sure
Oh, I'mma show you how to shake it
How the booty shake
Show you how to shake it
See the booty shake

See the booty shake
Like an earthquake
There is no escape
When I shake it in your face

Now don't you wanna tape
A booty shakin' on your tape?
So show it to your boys and
See the look on all they face

I move it to the left
Move it to the right
Double time, double time, all right
Show 'em what they like

Look at it, look at it
Slow motion, freeze
Stop for the camera
Paparazzi wanna see
Cheese

Hello, hey how you doin'?
I shake it like this
Now let me see if you can do it

Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop it on the one
Shake, shake, shake, shake
They faces all stunned

If you got it, got it, got it
