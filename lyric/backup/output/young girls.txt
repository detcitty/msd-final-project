I spent all my money, bought a big old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honies
Oh, yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long

All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young wild girls
