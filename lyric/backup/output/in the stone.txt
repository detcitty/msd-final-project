I found that love provides the key
Unlocks the heart and souls of you and me
Love will learn to sing your song, yeah
Love is written in the stone

Every man I meet is walking time
Free to wander past his conscious mind
Love will come and take you home, yeah
Love is written in the stone

Do you believe, my friend in what you claim
People of the world all doubt the same
Bringing questions of their own, yeah
