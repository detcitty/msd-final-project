Ladies and gentlemen
You are listening to the sounds of Swiss beats
We got cassidy in here Kels! We not throwbacks
This is for the ladies, we got room keys

Girl you wanna come to my hotel
Baby I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl
And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie

So if you wanna come to my hotel
All you gotta do is holler at me
'Cuz we're having an after party
Checkin' out 6 in the mornin'

6 in the mornin', 6 in the mornin'
6 in the mornin'
Checkin' out 6 in the mornin'
6 in the mornin', 6 in the mornin'

I'm staying in the hotel, not the motel or the Holiday Inn
If that girl don't participate well then I'm a take her friend
Well if mami is with it then, mami can give it then

Mami a rider, I'm a slide up beside her
I got a suite you can creep on through
I know you tryin' to freak on too
I'll do it all for that

Yeah I ball for that, hit the mall for that
Keep it fly for them, keep my eye on them
