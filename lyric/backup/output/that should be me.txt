Everybody's laughin in my mind
Rumors spreadin' about this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me
Does he love you the way I can
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
Cuz baby I didn't

That should be me, holdin' your hand
That should be me, makin' you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feelin' your kiss
That should be me, buyin' you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'till you believe
That that should be me
