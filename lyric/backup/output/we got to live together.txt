Do do do do do do... 

We got to live together
We got to live together
Everybody, sing it
We got to live together
Yeah, yeah
We got to live together

Now let me tell you about it

Folks running around
Talking a lot of jive
Fussing and a fighting
Might lose their lives

You better raise your head up high
Or else you might be dead
You run around, jiving
But don't you be afraid, 'cause
