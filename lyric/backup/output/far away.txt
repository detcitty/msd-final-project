This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know

You know, you know
I love you
I've loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go
