Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in pull that pin
Fear thy name: Extermination
Desecrate inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the Crypt
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still
Fear thy name: Annihilation
Desolate inhale the fire
