I'm gonna wear my flip-flops and
I'm gonna play some flip-cup and
Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger
And throw a 20 on the corn hole game
If I'm lucky yeah I might get laid
The way that it's going, the keg gon' be floating

All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
