Me First!

She wanna have whatever she like
She can if she bring her friend
& we can have one hell of a night

I mean you probably might be sayin' you ain't jockin' either

Yeah, the type that make you tell a bitch just dance
& fuck them other niggas 'cause you down for her bitches
Fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for the stickin'
& fuck them other niggas hope she down for some lickin'
& fuck them other bitches

'Cause she's down for the trickin' up
I'm hopin' she a rider
When it's said & done
& she spit it up & swallow now
I ain't got a trip about them niggas who like her

But me & mommy know who can really make her go...

(Oh, oh oh oh)
Yeah, yeah.
(Oh, oh oh oh)
