listen homeboys don't mean to bust your bubble
but girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
so next time a girl gives you the play
just remember my rhyme and get the hell away

Just last week when I was walking down the street
I observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet
I walked up to her I said hello
she said you're kind of cute I said yes I know
but by the way sweetheart what's your name
she said my friends like to call me exotic Elaine
I said my name is the Prince and she said why
I said well I don't know I'm just a hell of a guy
but enough about me yo let's talk about you
and all the wonderful things that you and I can do
I popped some cash and in a little bit of time
I showed some cash and the girl was mine
I took her over town I wined her and dined her
she ask me did I like her I said well kinda
all of a sudden she jumped out her seat
snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street
she started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging
so I shoved her away I said you better stop buggin
she got mad looked me dead in my face
threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape
I got scared when she started to yell
so I handed her my wallet and ran like hell
I was duckin through alleys right and left
but when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death
I was arrested charged with agrivated assault
(yo Clancy we got him)
but it wasn't my fault
