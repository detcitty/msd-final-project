Johnny's daddy, was takin' him fishing
when he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
said we can't leave her behind
Son I know you don't want her to go
but someday you'll change your mind

And Johnny said
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Timmy Thompson
take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go
