"Don't you ever wish
You were someone else
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly

Don't you ever say
You don't like the way you are
When you learn to love yourself
You're better off by far

And I hope you always stay the same
'Cause theres nothing about you I would change

I think that you could be
Whatever you wanted to be
If you could realize
