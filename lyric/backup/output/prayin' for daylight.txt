(I dont wanna spend another lonely night oooh)
I've got the lights turned up
The door is locked, the bedroom TV's on
Doing the only thing that gets me through the night
Since you've been gone

Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
(Prayin' for daylight)

I made a bad miscalculation
Betting you would never leave (never leave)
'Cause if you're getting on with your new life.
