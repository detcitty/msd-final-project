Now that I've passed your test
How can I prove to you baby I'll never let you down
If I led you around, I'm sorry
But I never meant to worry you... no
Now that I've kissed your breast
How can I prove to you baby I'll never make you sad
If I ever had, do believe your tears tears won't come back again
