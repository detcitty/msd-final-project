A lonely boy in the city
Standing tall up to his blue jean jacket and eyes of pity
He's got a dream, now he told his Papa
"Don't you worry Daddy
I'll be back to show you what a life I've made"
With a tear falling from his eyes
He knew that he wanted to be
Oh, he wants to be, yes, he's got to be
Oh, he'd love to be a teenage idol
