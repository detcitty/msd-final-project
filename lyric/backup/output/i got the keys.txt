We The Best music!
Oh, this what we doin' here
Another one!
I'ma have to put my jewelry on for this one
Wraith talk, Wraith talk, oh, we talkin' that Wraith talk
Safe talk, safe talk, here we go talkin' that safe talk
Major key alert!
Oh, we good now
Major bag alert
DJ Khaled!

I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys
We go to court, we gon' plead the fifth
I know the judge, I'ma shoot him some chips
I got them keys, keys, keys
I got them keys, keys, keys

Niggas always asking me the key
'Til you own your own you can't be free
'Til you're on your own you can't be me
How we still slaves in 2016?
Key to life, keep a bag comin'
Every night another bag comin'
I ain't been asleep since '96
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
I been speedin' through life with no safety belt
One on one with the corner, with no safety help
I perform like Josh Norman, I ain't normal, nigga
Just a project nigga out in Beverly Hills, California, nigga
