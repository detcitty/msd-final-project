It's not surprising it could end like this
Your eyes are open even when you kiss
You're so distant
So cold, So resistant

You see the world in only grey and black
How could anybody live like that
Without screaming
Without dying for dreaming

And you stare out the window at the passing cars
And you look at the sky, 
think you run like the stars
No you're never quite happy right where you are

Keep on
Inventing shadows
Where there are none
