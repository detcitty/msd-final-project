When you want all the love you deserve
And the heat's on your mind
Don't you even think about it, I'll be there just wrapped around you
I can't hold back what I feel inside, it's just a fact

That you should be mine, anything you want
You got to fortify my love, you fortify me
You should be mine, anything you want
You got to fortify my love, you fortify me

And you woo-woo-woo
And you woo-woo-woo
And you woo-woo-woo
You should be mine, all mine
