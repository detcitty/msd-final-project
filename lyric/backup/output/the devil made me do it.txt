All set
Court's in session
This judge's
Got no compassion
Witness
Show me your right hand
I swear
Nothing but the truth now

I was alright till she came along
I was alright, then it all went wrong

Yea
The Devil made me do it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It was an act of a man possessed now
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yea the Devil made me do it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your Honor, I'm pleading innocent

D.A.'s
Got a mighty strong case
