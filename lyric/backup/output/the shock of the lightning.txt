I'm all over my heart's desire
I feel cold but I'm back in the fire
Out of control but I'm tied up tight
Come in, come out tonight

I'm coming up in the early morning
I feel love in the shock of the lightning
I fall into the binding light
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight

Love is a time machine
