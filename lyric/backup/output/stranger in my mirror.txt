There's a stranger in my mirror
Who don't know how to behave
He keeps grinnin' 'bout you
And whistlin' tunes
While he ought to be watchin' me shave
We move alike and we look the same
But I swear we've got totally different brains
And the love we're in with you just makes it clearer
He used to be my twin
Now there's a stranger in my mirror

And he doesn't want to go out drinkin'
With all of his friends, no more
He's got both of us thinkin'
