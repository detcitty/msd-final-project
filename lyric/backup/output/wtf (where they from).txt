The dance you doing is dumb
How they do where you from
Stickin' out your tongue girl
But you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit looks fun
That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

I'm so faded, no exaggeration
Backs breakin' like a percolation
Boys to the yard for some hip spankin'
Where you make it drop down like you in the matrix
Can't take it, them chicks been fakin'
Ya'll still sleep, better stay awakened
Hot new dance for the hood to make it
Make the dope move fast, make them think you drinkin'
Head to the floor don't collect that though
You better huddle up cause the beat's so cold
Pop that, pop that, cock and reload
This another hit, I got an ace in the hole
Boys on my back, playa did you peep that?
You got a small stack, playa, you can keep that
I'm a Big Mac make you wanna eat that
Like m-m-m-m-m, yak it to the yak
Junk in the trunk make you pumps in the bump

Girls wanna have fun make you stickin' out your tongue

The dance you doing is dumb
