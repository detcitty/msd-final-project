Escucha el ritmo de tu corazon (feel the rhythm)

From the coast of Ipanema
to the Island of Capri
All the way to Kuala Lumpur
I will follow you wherever you may be
From the moment, I first saw you
Knew my heart could not be free

Have to hold you in my arms now

There can never be another for me

All I need is
The rhythm divine
Lost in the music

Your heart will be mine
All I need is

To look in your eyes

Viva la musica
Say you'll be mine
