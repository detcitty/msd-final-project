Yeah, I think I'm gonna leave
I just had that one drink
And we've all gotta be up early

Boys, we oughta shut'er down
Just take it to the house
â€˜Fore anybody starts getting crazy

I started walking across the floor
Before I got to the door

Aw Naw, Somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron
Hang on, I just might have to stay hey
