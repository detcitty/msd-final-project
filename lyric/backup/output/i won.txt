I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy
I won, I won, I won
A trophy
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
A trophy

Get to fucking on the dresser just to make that pussy wetter
Gotta put you in that vintage then you rocking Perry EllisAnnotate
Then I leave with you, only cause I believe in you
We get to banging on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them twelve foot ceilings I just painted the halls so I can breathe with you
So I can breathe with you
