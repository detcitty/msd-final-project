I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today's a painful reminder of why
It can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
And right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday

Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain

Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the mourning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya, your weather didn't poke its eyes out with the thorn
bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal, and hit the corner fast
