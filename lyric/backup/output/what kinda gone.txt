I heard the door slam
and I couldn't tell was it just the wind
or was she mad again - ah hell
she's gettin in her car
I hollered baby is there something wrong
thought I heard her say something sounded like I'm gone
but these days gone can mean so many things.

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
and theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
