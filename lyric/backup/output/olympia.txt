From the corners of the world they come
The bravest and the best
To write their names in history
And to face the final test

And they gather as they've always done
With one purpose and the one aim
To give their souls and bodies to
The challenge of the game

Olympia, Olympia
Light the flame
And let it burn
Olympia, Olympia
You will teach
And we will learn
We will learn
In your name
We have come
To honor courage
