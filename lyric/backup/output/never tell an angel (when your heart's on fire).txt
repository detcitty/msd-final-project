Woo! Let's go
yea yea yea
oh ho
come on baby
got to get the back
Don't ever tell an angel when your heart's on fire
She'll treat you like a stranger and she'll use her lies
Don't ever let that little girl know your one desire
Don't ever tell an angel when your heart's on fire
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
She will break your heart, she will make you cry
Never tell an angel when your heart's on fire
She will break your heart, she will tell you lies
My momma said "Now boy watch out you're bound to get hurt"
My daddy said go have your fun but son for what it's worth
