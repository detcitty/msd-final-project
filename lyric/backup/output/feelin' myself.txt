Whoo, W-w-w-will power

I be everywhere, everybody know me
Super, super fresh, what a dope styling
Hunny on my wrist, couple karats on my neck
Givenchy, keep the chickens in check
All these car keys drive them chickens to my crib
Dru Hill got somebody slipping in my bed
She give me IQ, that mean she get a head
I just give the beats, I don't give a bread

'Cause we be in the club
Bottles on deck
And God dammit, God dammit
I'm feeling myself
'Cause I'm a get it all
And I'm a throw it up
Like God dammit, God dammit
I'm feeling myself

Look up in the mirror
The mirror look at me
The mirror be like baby you the shit
God dammit you the shit
You the shit, you the shit
God dammit you the shit
God dammit you the shit
You the shit, you the shit

I be everywhere, everybody know me
Catch me in the club hundred bottles on me
I get busy like a one line
In the drop getting head baby never mind
We gettin' money why you playing with it
Pool in the crib you could land a water plane in it
Slick Rick looking at the mirror
Big Daddy Kane bitch like Shakira
1.5 custom made car
Me and will table looking like the bar
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem
And I don't give a fuck that's my fuckin' problem
