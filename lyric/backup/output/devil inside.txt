Here come the woman
With the look in her eye
Raised on leather
With flesh on her mind
Words as weapons
Sharper than knives
Makes you wonder
How the other half die
Other half die

Makes you wonder
Oh-oh-wonder

Here come the man
With the look in his eye
Fed on nothing
But full of pride

Look at them go
