Tell me, baby, how long has it been?
Here you come and here I go again
I must admit, you lookin' rather fly
You're a sight for sore eyes
(Sight for sore eyes)

Situation wasn't quite that cool
Seven years ago, we both were fools
But I'm real enough to let you know
That I'm never gonna let you go

I'm lovin' you, I'm still lovin' you, baby
I'm still in love
Nobody's gonna take yo' place in my life
I'm still in love
I'm lovin' you, I'm still lovin' you, honey
I'm feelin' you, what you feelin' too now?

Baby, whats that look upon your face, my dear?
It must be magic in the atmosphere
I'm gonna leave it up to chemistry
Stir it up, sugar free
(Stir it up, stir it up, baby)

Sexy jumpin', blazin' everywhere
My crib's closer, honey, let's go there
You got a sister feignin', "Baby please"
