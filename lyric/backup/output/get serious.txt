Get ready, get down
Yet another round
Weekend coming up
In this funky town

Homeboys and homegirls
Shaking loose
Some come to be seen
Some come to drink juice

Some get it
Some get more than enough
Some don't, you can tell
'Cause they always play tough

For a lady, four o'clock
Cracked up, backed up
Against the wall
Some get smacked up

But no matter what you do
You know the name of the game
Yo, we all came for the same

Shaking, breaking
Girl, shaking
Get on the dance floor
And I'll take in

Our affinity to rock it
And pump it up
The funky rhythm makes me go
And I just can't stop

Don't hang on the walls
What's the matter with you people
I don't take no crap
