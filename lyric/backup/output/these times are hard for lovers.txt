Babe I had a dream
Woke up in a sweat
Darkness all around me
I was caught in its net
Tried to reach for you
But you weren't there
It only was a dream
But it put danger in the air
I can feel the nervous rhythm
of your heart with mine
Could we ever stay together
Stand the test of time
Baby make me a believer
Cause this world will lie
(Oh these times are hard for lovers)
It's getting harder for you and me
(Oh)
It's hard on me and you
Baby we can make it
Cause our love will pull us through
These times are hard for lovers
It's down to me in you
Nothing's gonna break us
If we hang on to what's true
These times are hard for lovers
I believe in you
These times are hard for lovers
