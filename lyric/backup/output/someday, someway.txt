I can't stand to see you sad
I can't bear to hear you cry
If you can't tell me what you need
All I can do is wonder why

Someday, someway, aww
Someday, someway, yeah now
Someday, someway, maybe I'll understand you

After all you've done for me
All I really want to do
Is take the love you've brought my way
And give it all right back to you
