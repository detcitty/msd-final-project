Yeah, heh, all these I've wanting you in my life,
And now I finally have you.
I'm a do everything in my strength to keep you near.
I care about you, I just want to make you smile.

All the many days you were on my mind,
Visions of me with you, all the time.
You wasn't looking for a man, you made it clear(clear to me).
And now I'm ever so glad that I have you near.
Here in my life, just you and I.
We can do whatever we want to.
I'm living my life with you by my side,
One day I'm a make you my wife, baby.

I was excited, cause I was falling, falling in love with you.
