Your technique
It leaves me weak
My heart knows
It's the beat I seek

And I found it
(Just got lucky)
Oh yes, I found it
(Just got lucky)

I never worry
That your love is fake
I'm free and easy
And I'm feeling jake

'Cause I found it
(Just got lucky)
Oh boy, I found it
(Just got lucky)

'Cause I never felt
This way before
Like a dog always
Begging for more, yeah

I've been fooled
By love so many times
I gave up all the silly rhymes
Kept my feelings
All inside my heart

A locked door
No key was cut
There was no fit
Now I'm such a very lucky guy
Gang way one side now
Come on here me say

We found the answer
And it's plain to see
(Come on here me say)
I'm for you and you're for me
