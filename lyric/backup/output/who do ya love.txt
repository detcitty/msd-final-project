I've got this feelin' all down inside
And this feelin' I just can't hide
I really love you, I really do
But I don't get the same feelin' from you

Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love (Tell me)
Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love

I would give anything in the world
Just to have you with me, girl
If it's a game I don't want to play
I'll just go my own separate way

Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you really, really, really love (Tell me)
Who do you love, who do you love (Tell me)
