Sometimes you feel insecure
Trust me babe I understand (straight up forreal)
Even with no manicure
Just know that I'll still hold your hand (haha, I'm just sayin')
You look so good when you walking by
Sexy comes in every size
Keep wearing that, you ain't playin'
You got yourself a new man
F Kanye's Workout Plan
I call that baby fat (baby fat)
Cause you sure look good to me
I think

You're so beautiful (shake it, shake it)
Give the world a show (move it, move it)
Go up down, up down, up down
Go up down, up down, up down
Shake it fast, its yours
(How much you pay for it?)

I say, you're so beautiful (shake it, shake it)
