All my love is all I have
And my dreams are Very Special
All my life I've looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love and us is Very Special
Things you seem to do divine
You looked straight into my eyes
I know our love is meant to be
Cause our souls touched tenderly
Love is life and life is living, it's Very Special

In my heart it was you, only
Love is life, what dreams come true
And even though i can't have you, baby
Desires like these are true for you
