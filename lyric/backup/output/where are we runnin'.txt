Fast lane, high speed, on the grind
24/7
No time, always runnin' here and there
Chasin' the money
So much jibber jabber's cloggin' up our soul

Where are we runnin'?
We need some time to clear our heads
Where are we runnin'?
Keep on working 'til we're dead
Where are we runnin'?
Ooo wee ooo wee ooo
Where are we runnin' now?
