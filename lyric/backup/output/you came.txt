Someone I know is staring at me
And when I look into her eyes
I see a girl that I used to be
I hardly recognise
Cos in the space of a year
I've watched the old me disappear
All of the things I once held precious
Just don't mean anything anymore
Cos suddenly

You came, and changed the way I feel
No one could love you more
