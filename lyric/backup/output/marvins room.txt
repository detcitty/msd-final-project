Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good. you still working?
Tonight... right now? Did I go out? Yeah, I went out
I went. I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit. wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious.

Cups of the Ros√©, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that I'mma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
