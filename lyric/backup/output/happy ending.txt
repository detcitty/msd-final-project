I'm in a movie where boys meets girl.
What happens to me in this brave new world?

Do I listen to my heart? Do I listen to my head?
Do I look at what I see, or remember what I read?
When I tell you how I feel do I wonder what I say?

Is there nothing we can do about it?
Anyone, anyone can be so hardhearted,
