Can you ride the rhythm
Of this human wave
Caught up in the music
And the space you save

Caught up in the magic of it
Caught up in the madness
Sometimes, you scare yourself
You're so strong, you're so tough

Can you feel the fire
Pumping through your veins
You try to get up
And here it comes again

Right down to the basics of it
Right down to the wire

Well, if you feel like you're
Hanging on a heart attack
Hold on, come back, oh, yeah
