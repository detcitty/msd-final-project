Well, I grew up in one of them old farm towns
Where they hit it hard 'til the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care
That we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured that's how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain baking in the sun
Don't quit 'til the job gets done

That's the only way I know
Don't stop 'til everything's gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Don't back up, don't back down
Full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
