Where are the dreams
That we once had?
This is the time
To bring them back

What were the promises
Caught on the tips of our tongues?
Do we forget or forgive?
There's a whole other life
Waiting to be lived when
One day we're brave enough
To talk with conviction of the heart

And down your streets
I've walked alone
As if my feet were not my own
Such is the path I chose
Doors I have opened and closed

I'm tired of living this life
Fooling myself, believing we're right when
I've never given love
With any conviction of the heart
