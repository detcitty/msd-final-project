I thought you were my girl
Then you came and rocked my world, well, well
Our love was right on time
Now you've gone and blown my mind, yeah

I got the feelin' it's over
The funny feelin' that it's over
I got the feelin' it's over
[I got the feelin', really, really got the feelin']
The funny feelin' that it's over now

I thought we had
Such a love affair, baby
Was I so wrong
Is it over now, over now

Ooh, I'd like to know
What you feel for me, sugar
Is it really real
Or is it just a lie, yeah

I'd like to know, baby [I'd like to know]
Is there a chance for us
Or is this the end, baby [Is this the end]
Of our romance
