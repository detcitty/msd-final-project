All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

(Puffy)
When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, opposites attract but
We one and the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play witchu, I wanna lay witchu,
Stay witchu, pray witchu, grow old and gray witchu,
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
'Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
