(L. Raspberry)

She left the credit cards under her goodbye note
'All of these are yours, goodbye' and that was all she wrote
Keys to the Porsche she dropped on the floor in the den
Left in the? 0 Dodge that he drove her in
She wasn't angry, she wasn't sad
She was just leaving a life that a lot of women wish they had

Tired of being blonde
