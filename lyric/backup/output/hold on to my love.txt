Today, you came by, to tell me you are leaving me, and to say, that
the love, and all that we knew had just drifted away. And I look, in
your eyes, and I couldn't bare the pain I felt inside, of my heart. To
think I'm gonna be lonley again, and if e-ever, then I know at a glance
that I don't stand a chance.

Chorous:
