Fathers are pleading, lovers are all alone
mothers are praying--send our sons back home
you marched them away--yes, you did--on ships and planes
to the senseless war, facing death in vain
Bring the boys home (bring 'em back alive)
bring the boys home (bring 'em back alive)
bring the boys home (bring 'em back alive)
