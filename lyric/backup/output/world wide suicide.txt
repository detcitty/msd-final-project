I felt the earth on Monday, it moved beneath my feet
In the form of a morning paper laid out for me to see
Saw his face in a corner picture, I recognised the name
Could not stop staring at the face I'd never see again

It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when a war has taken over?
It's the same everyday in a hell manmade
What can be saved and who will be left to hold her?

The whole world, world over
It's a world wide suicide
