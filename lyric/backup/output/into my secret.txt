Psst, I've got a secret to tell

I'll let you into my secret
I'll let you into my secret

Can you keep it, keep it up
When you get to the
Heart of the mystery
Can you keep it when you see
Why a treasure is buried in secrecy

I'll be waiting to let it go
It's been building up
For such a long time
Are you ready, do you know
It's time for me to open your eyes

I'll let you into my secret
If you're in, you could never get out
I'll let you into my secret
Give the whispers something
To shout about
