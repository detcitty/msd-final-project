Welcome to my rodeo
Hold on to me
Baby I'mma take it slow
How you ride is the key

We gonna go left, right, front, back
And no, that just ain't, that that just ain't, that just ain't enough
I can take you everywhere, all around the world
I like how you do it, just put it in reverse cowgirl

Giddy up, giddy up, pump it up girl, set it up, set it up
I like how you do it, just put it in reverse cowgirl
Giddy up, giddy up, pump it up girl, set it up, set it up
I like how you do it, do it, do it

Just put your hands in the air
Wave 'em around and go yee haw, yee haw
Just put your hands in the air
Wave 'em around and go yee haw, yee haw

Baby let me rope you up
Tie you down, do it right
No matter how hard you buck
Gon' get wild all night
