Well I smoke and I fish
But not near enough to satisfy an itch
Of a girl, understand
I need something to do with my hands

I don't work, on a car
And I'm as bad at pool as I am at throwin' darts
And golf, not a fan
But I need something to do with my hands

So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
