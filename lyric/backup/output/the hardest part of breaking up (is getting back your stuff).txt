c'mon, yeah
yeah, 2gethers in the house.
yeah, put your hands up in the air,
gonna make ya bounce.
(repeat 3x)

its been so long,
since i've seen your face.
so long since i've been to 1st base,
(strike 3, your out!)
i really miss,
the feel of your kiss.
but can i have back my things,
before i get really pissed?

you had my heart,
my soul,
my attention.
but you walked out my life,
with my cd collection.

(we're breaking up!)
breaking up is hard enough. (oh, oh, oh, oh)
say you have nothing,
but i called your bluff.
you got my sweaters,
my hat,
i can't find my cat (meow!)
