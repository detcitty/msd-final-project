You know nothin's gettin' done
When talk is all you hear
Like someone revvin' up a truck
They never put in gear
But you don't see a cowboy run his mouth
And strut around
He just takes the bull by the horns
And throws him to the ground
Takin' care of business not just puttin' on a show
When it gets down to it, everybody knows
