Well, I've seen you before on that discotheque floor
You were driving me out of my mind
But I could have swore that I saw something more in your eyes
Although you were surrounded by beauty unbounded
Your glance was intended for me
And though I tried to hide it I found myself looking to see you
So then you took your chances, you made your advances
Your touch took my breath away
But when you said, "Hello, are you ready to go?
Well, I had just one thing to say
If you can't give me love honey, that ain't enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings with old fashioned meanings
You're just in love with yourself
If you can't give me love
(Love)
If you can't give me love
(Love)
If you can't give me love
(Love)
If you can't give me love
(Love)
