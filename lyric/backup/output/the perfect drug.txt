I've got my head, but my head is unraveling
Can't keep control; can't keep track of where it's traveling
I've got my heart, but my heart is no good
And you're the only one that's understood

I come along, but I don't know where you're taking me
I shouldn't go, but you're wrenching, dragging, shaking me
Turn off the sun; pull the stars from the sky
The more I give to you, the more I die

And I want you
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you

You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug
You are the perfect drug, the perfect drug, the perfect drug
