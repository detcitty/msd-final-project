So, so you made a lot of mistakes
Walked down the road a little sideways

Cracked a brick when you hit the wall
Yeah, so you didn't do the best
It pull you down faster than a sunset
Hey, it happens to us all
When the cold hard rain just won't quit
And you can't see your way out of it

You find your faith has been lost and shaken
Here's your chance and it's worth taking

Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
