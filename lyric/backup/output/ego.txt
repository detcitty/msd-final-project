Take a look at me now and take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread, I'm in it for the gravy, honey
Step on the thin ice lightly
And check out the show twice nightly

Oh 'cause I, I'm on the stage tonight
And if the price is right
I, I will amaze before the light, I crave the light
Blinding white, I need the light tonight

Take a look at me now and take a look at my billing
I'm not in it as an extra, I'm in it for the killing
Inflate my ego gently
Tell them Heaven sent me
