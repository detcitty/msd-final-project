Oh, baby
Let's pick up the pieces
And let's work this thing out

Bring back the love of yesterday
From me, you stole your love away
The look of love has left your eyes
Replaced with anger and despise

I can feel a chill in the air, it makes me cold
And filled with despair
This raw silence leaves me dangling in space
I'll sacrifice tomorrow just to see your smiling face

The seeds of jealousy are
