I thought that dreams belonged to other men
'Cause each time I got close
They'd fall apart again
I feared my heart would beat in secrecy
I faced the nights alone
Oh, how could I have known
That all my life I only needed you?

Oh, almost paradise
We're knockin' on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
