Foe the love of money

Gotta make that money man
It's still the same now...

Gotta make that money man
It's still the same now...

Gotta make that money man
It's still the same now...

Gotta make that money man
It's still the same now...

Gotta get on the grind
Pop in the clip of my nine
And bitch if you slip
You hit the chalk and fall in the night time
Gotta get mine
Ain't taking no shorts or no losses
Hop on the phone
Call up my nigga sittin' at home
Polishin' that MAC-10 chrome
Gotta a lick we can hit
So bring yo shit
Cause once again it's on
To the dome with a fifth of bourb
My wig to the curb so we swerve
And rolled out to pick up the triple six thug
And follow the murder for robbin' the dopehouse
Smoke up outta me bong
So high, now comin' to slay with four grenades and a gauge
I'm a play, watch all 'em fall in the grave and lay
Pullin' in the driveway, Wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Bulldozed through the living room
Hopped out of the car and started to blow up
Buck, Buck, and a kaboom
And blew all them bodies all over the room
Them doomed
And gotta move fast, why?
The po-po's comin'
Snatch up me yummy
