It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was feet, from the bow to stern light
Secondhand, from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy, when he went there to get her

We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood, will never be forgoten

It was, just an old plywood boat
With a Johnson
With electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, "You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides"

Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When daddy let me
