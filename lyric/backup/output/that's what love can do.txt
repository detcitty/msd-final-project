That's what love can do
I don't wanna break your heart in two
And leave you crying
That's what love can do, oh no
I want you to know
I'm letting you go

You're just a fool
You say that I'm number one
And you'll always be true
How can this be?
You say, you've fallen in love
You don't know what it means
