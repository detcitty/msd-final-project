He's a man I ain't never seen, but my dream has told me so
He's a man with cash in his hand, he's my baby, my baby, oh no

If I denied, when I'm feeling alright
I'm so ready to go, and my baby, oh no

But my baby, oh no, you make me lose my self-control
I'll go crazy, whoah, if baby, oh no doesn't show
