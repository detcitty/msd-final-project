Tic toc, this is how we rock
throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
(Tic toc, you don't stop...)
[DOITALL:]

Tic toc, this is how we rock
we're those same (um) brothers that brought you "Chief Rock"
Now, um, underground's my style
to this I have vows
and I swear to my god
I'll always rock a crowd
So (um) peace to my area, N.W.K.
which is scarier
so if your on the deals, 
who cares, the more the merrier
Now right off South Orange
on the block of one-nine
of course, thirteenth ave 
is my stomping grounds
I open up my chest
and to my 'hood give my heart
'cause without the heart 
then your 'hood falls apart
So respect to the cement
the park called "the Corner"
'cause that's where the DOITALL TWO was performing
Runnin' from the cops
I couldn't be stopped
'cause i was jumpin' big gates that connected the blocks
Now before making records
the 'hood was my savior
but now I'm making tunes to make you jam wit 'cha neighbor...
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)
