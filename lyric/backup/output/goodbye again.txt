It's five o'clock this morning and the sun is on the rise
there's frosting on the window pane, and sorrow in your eyes
the stars are fading quietly, the night is nearly gone
and so you turn away from me, and tears begin to come

CHORUS
And it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know, it's goodbye again
