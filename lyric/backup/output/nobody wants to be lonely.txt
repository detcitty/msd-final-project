Ricky:
Why, why, why

Christina:
Oh ooh ohh

Ricky:
There you are, in a darkened room
And you're all alone, looking out the window
Your heart is cold and lost the will to love
Like a broken arrow
Here I stand in the shadows

Christina:
In the shadows

Ricky:
Come to come, come to me

Both:
Can't you see that

Nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to cry
My body's longing to hold you
So bad it hurts inside
Time is precious and it's slipping away
And I've been waiting for you all of my life (ohh)
Nobody wants to be lonely
So why (why), why don't you let me love you

Why (ooh ohh yeah), why (oh why), why
