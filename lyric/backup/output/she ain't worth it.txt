Better make tracks fast on the doubles
The girl's jazzy but she's nothin' but trouble

You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind

But she just cops an attitude
Leads you on then leaves you blue
Can't you see she's really just a waste of time?

One day she'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think your love will win her
In the end, think again

She ain't worth it, the girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through
