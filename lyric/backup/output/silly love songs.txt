You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
I look around me and I see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

I can't explain the feeling's plain to me; can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me now can't you see?
