Good Lovin'...
Ow! Yeah!

I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
Listenin' for the telephone
But when I get your call I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is a dream come true
A real life fantasy

No matter what your friends try to tell ya
We were made to fall in love
