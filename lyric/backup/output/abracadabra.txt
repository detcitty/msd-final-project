I heat up
I can't cool down
You got me spinnin' 'round and 'round
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Where it stops nobody knows

Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burnin' flame
Burnin' flame full of desire
Kiss me baby
Let the fire get higher

Abra-abracadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abra-abracadabra
Abracadabra
