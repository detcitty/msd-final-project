Now you're gone
I can feel my heart is breaking
And I can't go on
When I think of the love that you've taken

In the night
I pray for your embrace
Every time I close my eyes
I can't escape your face

You're out of sight
But always on my mind
I never realised
My love could be so blind

You're all I want
Can't you feel the love in this heart of mine
You're all I need
So maybe we could turn back the hands of time
