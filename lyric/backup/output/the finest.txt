As life goes on
You learn to hold on
You learn to appreciate the finer things in life
The finest

If I had a choice
I'd always choose love
Up or down, good or bad, I don't mind
Just as long as it's real

My friends say I'm lucky
To have found someone as good as you
My love's understanding
Understanding how to hold on to you

After all that we've been through
Time won't change the way I feel about you
Out of all the loves before
You're the finest I'll ever know (Finest I ever)

If I had to choose
I'd be by myself
I wanna be in love
But with nobody else, uh
