Hey, yeah rule baby

Smile

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime, tryin' to wash away
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me

All of those rainy days
Spend your lifetime, tryin' to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

We were always livin' so crazy and sexy and cool
And we began to love it
Watchin' all of the heartache and pain of the world
And thinkin' nothin' of it

Baby, I got a love for you
And I know that you got me, baby
But every time the sun shines bright
It gets so cloudy

It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me
