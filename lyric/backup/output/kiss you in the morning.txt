Your jeans are faded
In all the right places
You got me hanging on tight to your curves like little E Races
Girl your funky little back beat's got me
Feel like I'm tipsy and I ain't even had a drink
I wanna kiss you in the parking lot

Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right, just like
Everything you're doing to me right now is making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a lets go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
