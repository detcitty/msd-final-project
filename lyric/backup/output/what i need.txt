I said I'm tired and lost
I said I'm sick and tired
I'm tired of feeling the same

Well, I've been searching
Been looking so long
Forgot what the hell
What I was looking for

Uptight, nothing right
Can't sleep, can't eat
All night in bed I cry
Need somebody by my side

I feel my heart and soul
I feel the beat
I wish someone would give me
What say? What say?

What I need, I need
What I need, I need
I need something to come over me
Lift me up and set me free

Someone who can give me
What I need, I need
What I need, yeah

I said I'm lonely
And I don't believe
I've been waiting long
For someone to believe in
