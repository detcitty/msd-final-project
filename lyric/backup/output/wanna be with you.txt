I wanna be with you
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Be with you
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Be with you
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Be with you
Wanna be, wanna be
Be with you
I wanna be with you

Yesterday seems like so long ago
This space I'm in, reminds me so
Of the times, I use to rip and run
Shootin' my guns and out for fun

As time passed by, I changed my point of view
Started to search for someone like you
You made me feel so much love from the heart
