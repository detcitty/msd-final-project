Takes so long for
The day to go by
Whenever you're away

Can't hardly wait
Till I see you tonight
Let's watch this clock
Speed up the hand of time

Baby, maybe
Some things will change
But this one remains the same
And I know it will cause it's
The way I feel about you

[CHORUS]
Every time I think a happy thought
I think of you and your la la love
It's because I'm in love with you
