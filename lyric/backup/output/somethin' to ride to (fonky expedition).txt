Im just ridin' slidin' lets take a little trip
CMG and K and first to make a grip
Comin' from straight from out the old so you know that
We got the funky track thats phat
But anyway its my time so let me introduce
Special one first up from the gangsta crew
Known as CCD with a title and a rep
Its quite apparent
Servin' funky shit to keep you motherfuckers starin'
Pump it up mack shit for your ears
Kick it loud and clear
Making hoes dissappear
Hittin' doughnuts in a tre' sideways to the
Next light triple sold thangs and my shits tight
Five beat mobbin through in the town
Duce tone gangsta flake with the top down
Damn this shits hittin hard in the trunk
Got me three wheel switchin' on them bitches on the next block
Headed straight to the top
And as long as my skills pay the bills
