No one seems to think too much of me here
And they're glad to tell it to my face
And they're right I'm not supposed to be here
I'm completely out of place
Somehow there has got to be a reason
Evenings as I try to think it through
There's a bolt from the blue

And I see a Shooting Star
Set apart from all the rest
