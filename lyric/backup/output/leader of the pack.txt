Hey, is he really goin' out with her?
There he is, let's ask him
Hey man, is that your ring she's wearin'?
Uh, huh
Man, it must be great ridin' with her
Are you pickin' her up after school today?
Uh uh
By the way where'd you meet her
I met her at the candy store
She turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture?
Yeah, we see
That's when she fell for
The leader of the pack
Her folks were always putting me down
They said I came from the wrong side of town
They told her that I was bad
