I know you well
And I can tell
Something's on your mind

'Cause in your dreams
The demon screams
I know he's going to
Hurt you blind

You say you hunger
For something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore

If I was king for just one day
I would give it all away
I would give it all away to be with you

If I was king for just one day
I have just one thing to say
You know that love is all
We need to get us through

And diamond rings
And all those things
They never sparkle
Like your smile
