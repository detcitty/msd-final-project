Saludos, my dahlings, and you know who you are!
C'mon, let's mingle
So nice to see you
Throw your hips into the air
Like Syd Charisse and Fred Astaire
Let's crazy romance!

Just looking into your eyes, dahling
I can tell that you have the legs of a dancer
So bring those legs, and the rest of your body, over here
And be 'Nando's private prancer!

Dahling, I've got to tell you something
And I don't say this to everybody
You look mahvelous. Absolutely mahvelous! (Mahvelous!)

You know, my father used to say to me, " 'Nando, don't be a schnook.
It's not how you feel, it's how. You. Look!"
He was mahvelous!
But you, dahling, hmmmm, you look mahvelous!
Absolutely mahvelous!

And this is from my tongue which is deep inside my body
It's better to look good than to feel good.

(Fernando.)
Dahlings?
