Nothin' and nobody
Baby, could ever take or stop
The love that I have for you
It's very simple, you see it's
Baby, it's real
It's so, so real
What I feel

I'll do for you anything you want me to
You're my world, my hopes and dreams
Without you, girl, it don't mean a thing
For you I'll do anything you want me to
You're my world, my hopes and dreams
Without you, girl, it don't mean a thing

I never thought that I would be knowin'
The kind of love that you have been showin'
