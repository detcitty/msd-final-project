I'm not proud, I was wrong
And the truth is hard to take
I felt sure we had enough
But our love went overboard

Lifeboat lies lost at sea
I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
For lessons in love

For restless eyes, egos burn
