Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, praying the floor wont fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore I was fine
You paint a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain
When I lived in your chess game, but you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight

Well I stopped picking up, and this song to let you know why
Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known
