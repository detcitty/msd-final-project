What it is folks?
This right here is the 16 year old phenom chris breezy!!
Me myself im the 23 year old c.e.o. who?

Young carter, harder than them otha boyz,
I aint even frontin baby
I can take a summer off
I break a women off,
I can take the stomach off, one of my trucks now im ridin in the Guts
Line it on up guarunteed you'll get served
Lil chris aint runnin so im runnin to her
Im dat cash money youngin bird man junior
Just a president lookin 4 a monicer

The young boy just turned 16 and I got
64's and hot bikes that I rock
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock,
But all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop,
Cuz you speaking that slang that I talk
That sassy tempo with that walk,
Maybe the reason that all this teenies may never see me

Momma you may be, 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac,
You could be in the back saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)
