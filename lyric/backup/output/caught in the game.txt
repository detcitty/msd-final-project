You swore you'd never again let yourself be tempted
Too many times in the past when you've opened up your heart
You've had it broken in pieces by too many lies
Still it's hard to acknowledge the past when she flashes those eyes

Over and over
The song skips
Just as the final refrain fades away
Like fools we are caught in the game

Caught in the game
Caught in the game again
