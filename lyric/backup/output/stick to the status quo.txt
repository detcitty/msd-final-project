You can bet
There's nothin' but net
When I am in a zone and on a roll
But I've got a confession
My own secret obsession
And it's making me lose control
Everybody gather around

"If Troy can tell his secret then I can tell mine,"
"I bake..."
"What?"

"I love to bake, strudels, scones, even apple pandowdy."

Not another sound!

"Someday, I hope to make the perfect cr√®me brulee."

No, no, noooooooooooo

No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool
Follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo
Look at me

And what do you see?
Intelligence beyond compare

But inside I am stirring

Something strange is occurring
It's a secret I need to share
Open up, dig way down deep

"Hip-hop is my passion,"

"I love to pop, and lock, and jam, and break!"
"Is that even legal?"

Not another peep
