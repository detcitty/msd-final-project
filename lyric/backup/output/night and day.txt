Maybe you and I see life with two different visions,
and neither one of us is wrong or right.
And maybe we're too serious and don't wanna listen.
I just wanna make you laugh tonight.

We're like day and night, night and day.
We are both so different in so many ways.
We're like night and day, day and night,
and we go together just like black and white.

Seems you're always out one door when I'm in the other.
