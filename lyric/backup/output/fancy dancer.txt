Have you found yourself in love before?
Tell me ain't it a different kind of thing
So much lovin' such a real good feelin' child
The kind of feelin' good lovin' brings, yea

With your head on my shoulder
My head's a spinnin' round and around yea
I hear the sound of sweet funky music
Oh even when there ain't no sound yea

Visions of you my love dancin' in my head
The star in my life girl

Only one thing can be said that you're my
Fancy dancer yea
 (Fancy dancer)
You're my fancy dancer yea
 (Fancy dancer)
You're my fancy dancer yea, yea
 (Fancy dancer)
You're my fancy dancer yea
(Ooh ahh)
You're the only thing on my mind
You fancy dancer aou ha

Look here, the way you move is such a freaky thrill
Baby, it's the way you do your thing
