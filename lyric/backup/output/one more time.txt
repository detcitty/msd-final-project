[chorus]
One more time
Let's do it again
Show no shame,
Just call my name
One more time
Again and again
Don't you want to
Play my game?

24-7 I will make you feel like heaven
I turn you upside down
I spin you round and round
I put a spell on you baby
I will make you come and play me
I'm gonna make you mine,
Let's do it one more time
