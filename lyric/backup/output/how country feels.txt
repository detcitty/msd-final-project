You were raised on an asphalt farm
Ain't never heard a rooster crow
Never walked barefoot by a river
Felt the mud up between your toes

You never rolled in the hay
You never thrown it in four wheel
Climb up on in here, girl
Let me show you how country feels

Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
