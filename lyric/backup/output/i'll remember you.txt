Words have left us all alone
And something's come between us
To turn the fire cold
Thoughts that chase you in the night

Silently the storm
The life from in your eyes
And I remain alone, no matter
Who may try and take your place

And I'll remember you
The dreams we could of dreamed
The tears I should have seen
We used to say forever

But I'll remember you
Your pure and simple heart
Your shadows painted dark
