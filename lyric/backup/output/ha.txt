That's you with that bad ass benz ha
That's you that can't keep an old lady cause you keep fucking her friends ha
You gotta go to court ha
You got served a subpeona for child support ha
That was that nerve ha
You ain't even much get a chance to say a word ha
I know i ain't trippin don't your brother got them birds ha
You ready to bust one of them niggaz head ha
You ain't scared ha
You know how to play it ha
I know you ain't just gonna let a nigga come and punk you ha
Stunt and front you ha
Straight up run you ha
You know who got that fire green ha
You know how to use a triple beam ha
Shit ain't hard as it seems ha
You keep your body clean ha
You got a lot of girbaud jeans ha
Some of your partners dope fiends ha
You really don't want to fuck with them niggaz ha
You come up with them niggaz ha
You stuck with them niggaz ha

(Chorus) 2X
You a paper chaser
