Ooh, baby, let's be young tonight
Let's go dancing in the party lights
I'll go and shine my shoes, you get your blue dress out
Let's hit the discotheques and we'll turn them out

Yeah, baby, let's be young again
Let's get back, let's get back in the trend
'Cause it's not too late to celebrate
Let's go and wine and dine while we still have time

Come on, baby, let's be young tonight
Whoa, baby, dance in the party light
We're gonna boogie, baby
Boogie, me and my lady

We'll never know
When we'll get this chance again

Ooh, baby, let's be young tonight
Let's go dancing in the party lights
I'll go and shine my shoes, you get your ol' dress out
Let's hit the discotheques and we'll turn them out

Oh, baby, let's be young again
Let's get back, let's get back in the trend
'Cause it's not too late to celebrate
Let's go and wine and dine while we still have time
