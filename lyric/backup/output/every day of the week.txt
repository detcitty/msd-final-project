Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ooh... whoa... oh... oh... oh...
Oh, yeah

You were lookin' so good to me
The night we met, I could not see
How deep you were to penetrate my heart, mmm
Now that some time has passed
It made me think this was meant to last
I never wanna be apart, oh, no, no

Don't let me fool you
If I'm actin' kinda cold to you
It's just a little game I like to play
'Cause when we're together
It just keep getting better
If I had my way

When do I wanna see you
When do I wanna please you
Every day of the week
When do I wanna love you
When am I thinking of you
Every day of the week

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Even on Sunday
Every day of the week
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Even on Sunday
Every day of the week
