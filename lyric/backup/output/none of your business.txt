What's the matter with your life?
Why you gotta mess with mine?
Don't keep sweatin' what I do
Cuz I'm gonna be just fine - check it out!

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of yo business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of yo business
Now you, shouldn't even get into who I'm givin' skins to
It's none of yo business
So don't try, to go and change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of yo business

Now who do you think you are
Puttin' your cheap two cents in?
Don't you got nothin' to do
Than worry about my friends? -- Check it!

I can't do nothin', girl, without somebody buggin'
I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn't
They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one
Opinion's are like assholes and everybody's got one
I never put my nose where I'm not supposed to
Believe me, if he's something that I want, I'm steppin' closer
