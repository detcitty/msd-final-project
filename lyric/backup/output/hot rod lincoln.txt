My pappy said, "Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln."

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod
Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true,
I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor
and it's really souped up.
And that model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears
you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.
