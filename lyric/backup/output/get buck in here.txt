Check this out, listen to me, listen

Life is tricky I'm picky baby, but I just spotted you
Doin' your thing, g-string, shoe string point of view, hey
Lend me ya body, you got me in a zone
Bet a million and a half cash, I can make you explode

You don't wanna break the code, you want a day of Combs
I can take you on outer limits away from home
Where your girls pop, mammi wallin' for sure
In the middle of the club doin' her rodeo show

The whole scene steamy, wet dreamy
Invisible sex clean me, incredible sex, you need me
Ya ease me, please me baby, I maybe am little crazy
But in a way that make ya baby page me

Don't make me get buck in here!
Shorty drop it to the ground like she ain't got manners
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one night scandal

And I'ma get buck in here!
Damn lil' momma you know you fit my standards
You're the type to make me grip that handle
Lick shots in the air, bustin' at random
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
(You gotta shake that thang, shake that thang)
While you make it clap clap clap clap clap
(Just shake that thang, shake that thang)
