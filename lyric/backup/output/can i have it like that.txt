Ladies and Gentlemen
Yes sir
Let's do it
Yes sir
Hot...Yo


On and on and my nuts I'm palmin'
Take two of these and call me in the morning
You should see the way the chain harness the charm and
Fly, I'm like a bird like Nelly Furtado
Shit, pop your bottles, toast and scream cheers
Get your two step cause this the record of the year
Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, 2 for a pair
Officially announcing "This is warfare," cause
Back in the day, my clouds was grey
And it seemed liked my angels couldn't blow them away
But then I sold my first verse and copped that NSX
But I was still ridin' in them dead ass jets but now
Man my vision so clear out the window of the Lear and I'm
Talkin on my celly all the shit that you should hear
Listen clearly now
Hello? Can you hear me now?


Can I have it like that? 
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? 
(You got it like that)
Can I have it like that?
 (You got it like that)
