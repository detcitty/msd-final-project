Yaaah, oh yaaah
Ooooh, Thugger
Yeah, Travis Scott
Thugger, Thugger baby
Yaah

I pour a four up
I call your hoe up
Just to fuck her and show her
I just went, got my dough up
Pullin' off and I'm gone!
Then I go and pour four up
Then I roll up that roll up
Then I'm callin' your hoe up
(Like Brrrrr)

Pick up the phone, baby (Like brrrrr)
I know you're home, baby (It's lit!)
I'm in the zone, baby (Straight up!)
I just poured up a four baby (Yeah, yeah)

Never will I cheat on you
Never will I commit treason
Blowin' a bag on you
Do all of that for no reason
I'ma pull up and murk too
Hittin' the block and I'm bleedin'
Throwing that Rollie on you
I like the way it be freezin'
(Brrrrr)

Pick up the phone, baby (Like brrrrr)
I know you're home, baby (It's lit!)
I'm in the zone, baby (Straight up!)
