Things that make you go, hmm

I was at the crib, sittin' by the fireplace
Drinkin' cocoa on the bear skin rug
The door bell rang, who could it be?
Thought to myself then started to shrug

Got to the door, ding dong, who is it?
My girl's best friend had payed me a visit
Sly as can be tight dress and all
She knew that I was faithful, I really didn't have the gall

I tried to chill, she made the move
Now, I know my girlfriend wouldn't approve
I didn't realize my girl was settin' me up
Yo, my girlfriend didn't trust me, no

Yeah, but she lost control, I wouldn't take the bait
I said, "Chill baby, baby chill baby, baby wait"
My girl bust in, caught us creatin' a boom
She said, "Girlfriend"?

Things that make you go, hmm
Things that make you go, hmm
Things that make you go, hmm, hey
Things that make you go, hmm, hmm, hmm
It's the things that make you go, oh, oh, oh

Here's how it started
Just an example of how another brother can trample
Ruin your life, sleep with your wife
Watch your behind

There was a friend of mine named Jay
Would come over late at night and say, "Hey"
I watched the fight, I thought is was alright
'Cause me and Jay who were really really tight

So damned close we had the same blood type
Months went by and my wife got big
We were havin' a child and I got another gig
