Too hot ta trot (Hey, say what)
Too hot ta trot
Too hot ta trot (Woo)

Well, you're too hot ta trot, now baby
Well, you're too hot ta stop, woo, baby
Well, you're too hot ta trot, now baby
Well, you're too hot ta stop, woo, baby

The things that you do
The things that you say
That you love me, baby
In the strangest way

What you're doin' to me, girl
Is knockin' me down
I can you right now
That you're the best thing around

Sweet pretty woman, I just want you to know
