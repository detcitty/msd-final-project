Hold it now
I'm flexin, shawty
Hold it now
I'm stupid, ho
Hold it now
I rep it shawty
Hold it now
Bitch you ain't know?
Hold it now
I'm Gucci'd parnter
Hold it now
I'm Louis'd down
Don't do it partner
Hold it now
Or it's going down

I wear Strivers Row my Louis ho
AKOO be matching my kicks, bitch
Paparazzi everywhere I go
Got cameras all in my business
I rep the town, hold it down
Cruise all around in my old school
My speakers loud and my reefer too
I ain't speaking, bitch, do I know you?
Feds want me back behind that wall
It's the only place that I can't go
I'm focused dog, I ain't with that fuck shit
Think it’s sweet but it ain’t though
I'm tried and true when I'm riding through
I ain't hiding they can just hate me
My top is down and my pockets fat
And my diamonds clearer than HD

Hold it now
