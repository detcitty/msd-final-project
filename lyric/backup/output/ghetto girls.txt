Verse 1 (JD)
Like when Janet was Justice that's what I'm talkin' bout
A shorty that can tell ya when the J's come out (okay)
Get creative with the hair cuts like T-Boz
Favorite rappers is bow wow, snoop, JD, and nas (ha, ha)
Always up in somebody's face tryin to fuss
And to get where she going she can take the bus (uh)
Like when Jada was Peaches in the movie Shame (uh huh)
Hard to find her time to be sittin' at the Rucker's game(okay)
They only like dealin'wit cats that love to floss
Only like rockin' the stuff that really costs
Lip gloss shinin'(uh), tattoos on the back
Attitude like Mary J. mixed wit Brat (I like that)
You can find 'em at a beauty shop, mall, or church
Name brand hat, shoes, with the matching purse
So all that sedity stuff, yall can keep
Cuz only girls that keep it ghetto that can ride wit me fo' sho
