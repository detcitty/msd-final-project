And she said
You a God damn liar
I ain't mean to say that shit girl I was God damn high
So we left the crib now we in the God damn ride
She lookin' God damn fine
I wanted a bitch who was down to Earth
But she want the God damn skies
Least of my problems
Got this one on my line they won't stop fucking callin'
It's crazy I made her that way
Every time I see her out, I see the hate in her face
Like why you do that
Tell her you love her when next week you just want your space
Why you do why you do that
Tell her you want her but next week you do your own thing
Why you do why you do that
I can't explain it but just know it working for me
She text me I hate you I hate you I hate you I hate you
But how the fuck can you hate me
