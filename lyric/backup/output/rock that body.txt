I wanna rock right now
I want I wanna rock right now
I want I wanna rock right now
Now, now, rock right now
I want I wanna rock right now
I want I wanna rock right now
I want I wanna rock right nooow

I wanna dance, I wanna dance in the light
I wanna rock, I wanna rock yo body,
I wanna go, I wanna go for a ride,
Up in the music & rock yo body right,

Rock ya body, come on come on rock that body, (Rock your body)
Rock ya body, come on come on rock, ya, body,
Rock ya body, come on come on rock that body (Rock yo body)
Rock ya body, come on come on rock, ya, body!

Let me see your body rock,
Shakin' from the bottom to the top,
Freak to what the Dj drop,
We be the ones to make it hot, (To make it hot)
Electric shock, energy like a million watts,
Space be boom and the speakas pop,
Galactic gone and miss the spot,
We bumpin' in your parkin' lot!

(Parkin' lot)
When you comin' up in the spot,
Don't bring nothin' we call pink dot,
'Cause we running around the clock,
Hit the lights and then turn them off,
If you bring that don't make you soft,
Like the jungle we run the block,
