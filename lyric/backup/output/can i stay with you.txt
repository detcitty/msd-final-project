Never felt so good before
Never dreamed I would explore
Makin' love in the positions that you got me doin'
I never thought I'd beg for more
Never thought I'd find a man who can do it again and again
And then even do it like once again

I've never trembled in my life
Heard about it once or twice
But now I'm shakin'
And I swear the shakin' feel so nice

Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do
'Cause I don't want to be away from you
You shouldn't have felt so good
Lord knows I've never felt so good
It's wonderful
Well, there's only one thing I need to know

Can I stay with you, babe
For the rest of the night
Can I stay with you, babe
For the rest of my life

Can I stay with you, babe
Through the end of all time
