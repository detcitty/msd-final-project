'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, this life
Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to the money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould

But I'm a million different people from one day to the next...
I can't change my mould, no, no (have you ever been down?) no, no
Well, I've never prayed
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now
