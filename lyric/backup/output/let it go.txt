Ready or not, here I come
(Come on)
(Come on)
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason 2 let somebody know
Lover here, lover there - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows

Until now all I wanted 2 do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

But now I've got 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
