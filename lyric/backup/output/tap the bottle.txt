(Chorus)

Tap the bottle and twist the cap
Tap the bottle and twist the cap
Tap the bottle and twist the cap
And pass it around the crew be cause the crew be all that

Hey yo, hickory dickory dock I'm under the Brooklyn block yes
Who's the next to testify and try and penetrate the vest
Diggatie do re me fa so la ti do I drop back my prozac
I take it in track and give it a smack and cuttin no slack, jack
Okay here I go Shorty tap the forty O smash
To a pass, if ya crash make a dash to the trash
Tap a cap, have alot and not alot not a little
Don't grade upon the label take a guzzle, don't dribble
I got the supercalafragileisticexpialadoucious
You're commin to close to this, I get ferocious
Coax this rhyme, smoke this rhyme hype
When we rock it up on the mic, we rock the mic right
Pass the funnel to the tunnel like it's busy till I'm dizzy
