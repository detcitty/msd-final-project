Listen girl, who do you think I am?
Don't you know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work

Don't you forget I had him first!
What you thinkin', stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah
Do not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
