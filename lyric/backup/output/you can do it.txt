Take your shoes off, let your hair down
Time for you to get away
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
Are you gonna miss today?

Sometimes the madness gets you crazy, yeah
Sends you looking for a place to hide
Start you thinking that you never
Get yourself some piece of mind

But you can do it, you can do it
You can do it to your hearts delight
If you can do it with your imagination
Then you can do it in real life
