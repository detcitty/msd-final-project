This that new fire, man
DarkChild, Disturbing Tha Peace
Shareefa, here's another one, Luda

I told 'em we just gettin' started, man
Aiyyo, I don't think they really understand
What this is, bring that back
Ay, Shareefa, where you at, baby? Let's go

Come wit it, need somebody that's real gansta
Ain't a toy soldier, a real gangsta
Playa, holdin' me down like an anchor
I need a papi, somebody I call daddy

Hustla, any hood, he's a boss-a
Trapper, under the rugs, he's got stacks-a
Never see movies, don't like them actors
That's just what I go after
That's what I need

I-I-I be lookin'
'Cuz all these fakes thugs is tryna press up
I need a boss like hey, who's flossin' like hey
Tossin' dough, hey, you know that he'll pay

I-I-I be lookin'
'Cuz all these fakes thugs is tryna press up
I need a boss like hey, who's flossin' like hey
Tossin' dough, hey, that drives me crazy
