The Recession on the way hey but on another note
Alot of soundin like Young tell 'em register to quote
See I rolled them back to back like I'm registered to smoke
Yea I got it on me now but I ain't registered to toke
I put on for my city and I bought a blue -ghini
Goddamnit just missed me, shoulda saw me shoulda seen me

Do me a favor see them haters tell 'em (Picture Me Rollin')
Same time watch them Feds take a, pic of me rollin'
Got a phone call from 'Ye put my -libs on his song
So 3 million like us goddamn I put 'em on

I put on for my city yeah billboards everywhere
See me before your flight land, see me before your bag claim
Re-up in my city man you better check your bags man
Shouts out to the Eastside yeah they play them bag games
