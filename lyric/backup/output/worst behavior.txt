Worst
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit!
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us

Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see if I'm finished

On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us
Remember?
Mothafucka never loved us
Remember?
Mothafucka!
Remember?
Mothafucka never loved us

I'm on my worst behavior

Don't you ever get it fucked up
Mothafuckas never loved us
Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior
