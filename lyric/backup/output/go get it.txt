I got a grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't bet all I gotta do is
Go, get it, stay up out my business
Ball 'til I fall, flossin' til I'm finished
I just go, get it, stay up out my business
I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling I just go

Everyday above ground, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louis down to the drawers, Louis Vuitton kicks
Got a Mad Hatter swagger, bitch I'm stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they stupid dumb thick
I'm the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multimillion dollar shit
Money is the object, hot shit
Bitch I got a sauna on my arm
Six figure, with no diamond reach a million Vacheron
They just talk about they got it
I'm the upper echelon, though
Bitch I'm bout that action, you could go on with that convo'
I have done more than you dream bout
Got your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
