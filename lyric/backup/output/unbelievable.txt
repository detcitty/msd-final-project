You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies.

You're always askin' what it's all about,
Don't listen to my replies.

You say to me I don't talk enough,
But when I do I'm a fool.
These times I've spent, I've realized,
I'm gonna shoot through, and leave you.
The things, you say,
Your purple prose just gives you away.
The things, you say,
You're unbelievable.

Oh!
What the f**k...
What the f**k...
Whoa bad...

You burden me with your problems,
By telling me more bout mine.

I'm always so concerned,
With the way you say,

You're always at stop,
To think of us,
Being one is more than I'd ever known.
