Bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on, bring it on
(Break it down)
Bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on

Bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on, bring it on
(Break it down)
Bring it on, bring it on
(Bring it on)
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on

It's two o'clock in the morning
This is the time when games begin
I feel your body shakin'
'Cause you know just what I'm thinkin'

Let's lie here on the floor
'Cause my bedroom's too far to go
I just wanna get into you
And I'll do anything that you wanna do, just

Bring it on, bring it on
(Bring it on)
Bring it on, bring it on, oh ho
(Break it down)
Bring it on, bring it on
(Bring it on just)
Bring it on, baby, just bring it on

Bring it on, bring it on
(I know what you need)
Bring it on, bring it on
(Bring it home to me)
