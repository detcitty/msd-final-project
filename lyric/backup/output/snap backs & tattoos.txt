Snapbacks and tattoos
Nice whips, fly chicks
All that 'cause cash rules

Show off your hats
Show off your tats
Show off your arms, legs, chest, show off your back
Snapbacks and tattoos
Snapbacks and tattoos
Nice whips, fly chicks
All that 'cause cash rules

Ok now snapbacks and tattoos
Rap phat I'm that dude
My backpack got cash that
I make an a clap like tap shoes
I'm international
Y'all ns vaginal
I pass through, fresh to death
You've now entered swag school
Ladies holding kisses
Swag as cold as sickness
Teen Driicky tatted on 'em cause they're a is so ridiculous
In the 'Mazzi, paparazzi
Man they can't control the pictures
M-O-B tat, screaming money over bes
My clothes and tats they're all custom though
Something that you ain't accustom to
