Only losers go to school
I taught myself how to move
I'm not the type to count on you
'Cause stupid's next to I love you

No, So what can you show me, that my heart don't know already?
We make our own sense
And you're qualified to me
What can you show me, that my heart don't know already?
We make our own sense
And you're qualified
And you're qualified
