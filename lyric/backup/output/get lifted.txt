Uh-huh
Yeah
One two, one two
Smokin blunts
Mad Dog 20/20
We gonna get funky

I grab the forty rip off the skirt
Guzzle it, grab the mic and come out the woodworks
When shit's thick and no time to think
Keith Murray gets busy off a Basic Instinct
I puff a L and drink some liquor
Sit down and write a jam that receive the muhfuckin sticker
As God as my witness, with the sickness
Of a cannibalist cannibus I floats like a cumulus
My perpetual rebel intellectual
Won't catch a bad experience, with hallucinogenic either
I float simply with the canibus setiva
As my speech fall deep as in the scriptures
And graphic opponents like Picasso paint in pictures
If my eyes ain't red, it's all in my head
Once said by a Ph.D med
Legalize and I'll advertise, 'cause
