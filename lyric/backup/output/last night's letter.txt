Baby listen

I was sittin' at home, thinkin' to myself
I started thinkin' 'bout you
how much I do love you, I really do
I would never trade you, never forsake you
'Cause nothin' could be better
That's why I wrote you this letter, I love you always lady

Last night I wrote a short letter
(I wrote a short letter)
And it went this way
(And it went this way)
Dear baby I love you just thinkin' of you
(I love you just thinkin' of you)
Love always

Last night
(Baby)
I wrote a short letter
(I wrote a short letter for you)
