Mile on Mile no direction
We're all playing the same game
We're all looking for redemption
Just afraid to say the name
So caught up now in pretending
What we're seeking is the truth
I'm just look for a happy ending
All I'm looking for is you

It came upon me wave on wave
You're the reason I'm still here, yeah
Am I the one you were sent to save
