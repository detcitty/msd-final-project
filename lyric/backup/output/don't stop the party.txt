Don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't
Don't s-, don't s-, don't s-
Don't stop the party

Don't s-, don't s-, don't s-
Don't s-, don't s-, don't s-
-top, -top, -top
The p-, the p-, the p-, the p-
Don't stop the party

(Eh, my people, this is mega unstoppable)

Don't stop the party
Don't s-, don't s-, don't s-
Don't s-, don't s-, don't s-
-top, -top, -top
The p-, the p-, the, the party

This is that original
This has no identical
You can't hack my digital
Future aboriginal

Get up off my genitals
I stay on that pinnacle
Kill you with my lyricals
Call me verbal criminal

Send you to that clinical
Subscribe you some chemicals
Audio and visual
Can't see me, invisible

I'm old school like biblical
Futuristic next level
Never on that typical
Will I stop? I'll never know

I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won
Now, baby, don't you stop it, stop it
Now, baby, don't you stop it, stop it
