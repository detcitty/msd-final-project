You're tired of fighting
You want some love
You tell me maybe parting
Is all that's left for us
What do you want from me?
Ask anything
I'll give it all to you
Just don't let it end

Stay another night
Help me get it right
Say the word
Don't give it up, baby
Take another shot
And keep the fire hot
Say the word
Don't give it up, baby, no
Don't give it up
