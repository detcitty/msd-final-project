You take the clothes off my back
And I let you
You steal the food right out of my mouth
And I watch you eat it
I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
Ohhh
You curse my name
In spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much
Yeah

And Baby
It's amazing I'm in this Maze with you
I just cant crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sipping from the cup

Till it runneth over, Holy Grail

Blue told me remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y'all talk about
I'm the nigga, uh caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
God damnit it I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice
That's my bad, I cant even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder, Momma please just get my bail
