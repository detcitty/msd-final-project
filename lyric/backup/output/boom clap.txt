Boom! Boom! Boom! Clap!

You're picture perfect blue
Sunbathing on the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
First kiss just like a drug under your influence

Take me over you're the magic in my veins
This must be love

Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart
The beat goes on, and on, and on, and on
Boom! Clap! You make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart
