Ooh, yeah
From rags to riches, here I stand
Shaped and molded by your loving hand
With faith and trust unshaken
You led me all the way
Through years of joy and tears
I'm standing here to say

You're that one love in my lifetime
And if I search this whole wide world
I know I'll never find a love that's stronger
Than an oak tree
That will be standing in the sun
