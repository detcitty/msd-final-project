I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yeah
I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yeah
I love, I love, I'm ready to, ready to, ready to love
I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yeah

You keep me awake with your white lily smile
Don't keep me watching your charms all the while
'Cause as all the wise men say
