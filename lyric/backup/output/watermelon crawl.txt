I was drivin' through Georgia in late July
on a day hot enough to make the devil sigh
I saw a homemade sign writtin' in red
rhine county watermelon festival ahead

well, I wasn't in a hurry so I slowed down
took a two lane road to a one horse town
there was a party goin' on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor
