Everybody say ah, ah
Yeah, it's 50 Cent
And Lloyd Banks
And Young Buck
Yeah, and Joe, G-Unit

Everybody say
(La la la la la la la la la la la la)
Rock and roll wit ya to the cover
We'll still hit the blocks and I'm sold with you
Can you picture me and you not even friends no crew

We can do whatever you wanna do
I'll take your mind off whatever you going through
Just sit back and relax to the sound of the sax, I'm hood
But that don't mean I ride around with the rats
I work and make the music lose a couple pounds in the sack

Look at what we got right here such a work of art
Someone I'll give my heart do anything that's what I do
Just so that she would be mine I'll give her all my time
Every part of me my mind soul and my body were inseparable

Ride wit u, lie wit u
I wanna move with u, move with u, move with u
I wanna fly with u, ride with u, lie with u
I wanna move with u, move with u, move with u
I wanna ride

Your the type that just don't care
