Johnny, take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in to fill up your room
You've been living underground, eating from a can
You've been running away from what you don't understand

She's slippy, you're sliding down
She'll be there when you hit the ground

It's all right, it's all right, it's all right
She moves in mysterious ways
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right
