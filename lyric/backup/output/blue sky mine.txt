Hey, hey, hey, hey
(There'll be food on the table tonight)
Hey, hey, hey
(There'll be pay in your pocket tonight)

My gut is wrenched out, it is crunched up and broken
My life that is lived is no more than a token
Who'll strike the flint upon the stone and tell me why?

If I yell out at night there's a reply of blue silence
The screen is no comfort, I can't speak my sentence
They blew the lights at heaven's gate and I don't know why
