Girl, I know this might seem strange
But let me know if I am out of order
For stepping to you this way
See I've been watching you for a while

And I just gotta let you know
That I'm really feeling your style
'Cause I had to know your name
And leave you with my number

And I hope that you would call me someday
If you want to you can give me yours too
And if you don't well I ain't mad at you
We can still be cool 'cause

I'm not tryin' to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill
