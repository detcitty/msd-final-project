Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out

Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her no

If these walls could talk

I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk

I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it

If these walls could talk they'd tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I'm not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I'm just a tenant
