Now eva since I can remember, I've been poppin' my collar
(Poppin' poppin' my collar, poppin' poppin' my collar)
Now eva since I can remember, I've been workin' these ho's
'N they betta put my money in my hand

Now eva since I can remember, I've been poppin' my collar
(Poppin' poppin' my collar, poppin' poppin' my collar)
Now eva since I can remember, I've been workin' these ho's
'N they betta put my money in my hand

I know you sicker than sicka
When you see the rims flicka
The paint drip off
Ice in my Range glitta
I straight flippa
The cheese like pancake-a
Foldin' my cheese like the leaves in my hand bricka?
