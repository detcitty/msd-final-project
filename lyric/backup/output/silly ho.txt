Whoot whoot whoot whoooo
Whoot whoot whoot whoooo
Whoot whoot whoot whoooo
Whoot whoot whoot whoooo

I ain't never been no silly ho
Waitin' for your call
Like the other girls want you
I ain't never been no one to mess
With someone else's mess
That's not a thing for me to do
I ain't never been that chicken head
To wake up in your bed
After every club or two
Ain't gonna be the one in mini skirt
Always wanna flirt
With every player on the team

If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do, ooo ooo

I ain't never been no silly bitch
Waitin' to get rich
From a nigga bank account
I have always had my own things
