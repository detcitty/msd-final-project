Yeah
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
I woke up like fucking up this paper
Freebandz, Freebandz

I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy

I blow a bag today, I bought a whip on 'em babe
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em babe
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, shawty gon' fuck me so crazy
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi

I had a bag today, I blow the bag today
I had to grab the Wraith, I had to grab the Wraith
I had to change the safe, I had to change my bitch
Money'll change a nigga, the fame'll change a bitch
I know I came from poverty, I got my name from poverty
I know for sure, for sure
If my Granddad was livin', I know he'd be proud of me
