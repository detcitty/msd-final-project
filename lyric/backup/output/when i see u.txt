I put your picture on my mirror
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach there's a pain
See you walking my direction, I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Try to stand, but my knees go weak
What's happening to me?
Anybody can you tell me what it means?

I lay my head on my pillow
Starring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
The reason why

You're always on my mind
When you come around I get shy
Baby When I see you
When I see you
Never know when you might walk by
