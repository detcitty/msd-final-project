You were in college working part time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
