I wanna go higher (x3)
I wanna go higher (higher baby) (x2)

If I ever get down in the dumps
Short of a dollar nothin change for months
It seems to rain about every day
And all the news seeme kinda grey
Its no illusion call it reality
So I release more charge from my battery
We can rise death defy gravity
Bring about a sense of personality
So as I walk I look around
See some go up, some go down
There goes the mayor his nose is brown
Guess how he get to wear his crown
But his hands are shaking the walls are breakin
And one day they will all fall down
Sometimes its better that way
Makin space for a some day
