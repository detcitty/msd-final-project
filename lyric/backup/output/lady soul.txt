Whoa... Whoaa... Whaooaaa...
Laying near beside you,
Close as we can be.
I know what this leads to.
I know what you need. Yeah.

I'm ready to remember,
My love, laying it all on your hands.
Give you mine forever.
Everything I am.

'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul.
You warm my heart when I go cold.
Oh you are my, my, my, my lady soul.
