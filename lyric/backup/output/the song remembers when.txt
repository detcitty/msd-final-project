I was standing at the counter,
I was waiting for the change,
when I heard that old familiar music start.
It was like a lighted match
had been tossed into my soul -
it was like a dam had broken in my heart.

After taking every detour,
gettin' lost and losing track,
so that even if I wanted I could not find my way back.
After driving out the memory of the way things might have been...
After I'd forgotten all about us,
