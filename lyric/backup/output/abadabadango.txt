Abadabadango, can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years

We all have to use
Some kind of magic
Some of the time
Between the laughter and the tears
A place to draw the line

When they say that you can't
Say that you won't
So don't even give it a try

I know, hard as it seems
