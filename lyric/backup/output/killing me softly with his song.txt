Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song

Telling my whole life with his words

Killing me softly
With his song
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him and listen for a while

And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
