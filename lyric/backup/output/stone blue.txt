Peverett - Riff Bros. Music - ASCAP




Wind tearin' through the backstreet, I hear the rhythm of my heart beat,
Rain blowin' to my face, I'm tired of being in the wrong place.

Blues knockin' on my back door, I can't jump from the second floor,
Turn up the radio higher and higher, rock and roll music set my ears on fire.

When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through.
When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through.
