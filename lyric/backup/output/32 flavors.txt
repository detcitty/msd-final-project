Squint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I am a poster girl with no poster
I am 32 flavors and then some

Squint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I am a poster girl with no poster
I am 32 flavors and then some

And I'm beyond your peripheral vision
So you might want to turn your head
'Cause someday you're going to get hungry
And eat all of the words that you just said

I am what I am
