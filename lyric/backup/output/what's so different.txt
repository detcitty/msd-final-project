[Intro]
What's so different? (Uh huh)
Baby (Say what?)
What's so different? (Uh huh)
Yeah (Bom, bom, bom, bom yeah)
If you cheated on him
How I know you ain't gon' do it to me?
(Can you feel this? Bom bom bom bom, yeah)
I need to tell you something
Check this out
(Uh, Ginuwine, check)

You say you love me.
But at one time you loved him
So what's so different?
Tell me if you, were in my shoes
What would you do or think of me?
Would you trust me?

But you feedin' me, All this rap about,
How it's different
But it's not mentioned what you're doin' is wicked.
Now I'm having, second thoughts about,
You and me, cuz this is not how I want it or it should be.
