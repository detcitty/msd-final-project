Girl, you've been gone away a real long time
Now I really went out of my mind
We know how I miss your lovin' when you left, baby you did it
Ah baby, come here, let me caress you
Ah ah baby your letter, ah told me what you missed
Come here, sugar, and get to this
Ah baby, I want you here
I want to do something freaky to you
