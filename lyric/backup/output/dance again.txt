Dance, yes; (RedOne...)
Love, next.
Dance, yes; (J. Lo...)
Love, next.

Shimmy shimmy yah, shimmy yam, shimmy yay;
I'm a ol' dirty dog all day...
No way, José!
Your girl only go one way? Ay, mi madre...
You should check that out;
Maybe you ain't turn her out...
Maybe it's none of my business,
But for now work it out, let's get this, dalé...

Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside;
I find it so stupid, so why should I hide
That I love to make love to you, baby?
(Yeah... make love to me.)

So many ways, wanna touch you tonight...
I'm a big girl, got no secrets this time;
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby...
(Yeah... make love to me.)
