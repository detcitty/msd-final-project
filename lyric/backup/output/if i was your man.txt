Mmmm yea yea yea yea ohh ohh
Nanananana nanananananana ohh Nanananananana If I was your man, girl
Girl I'm so tired of games I just wanna settle down
I swear to you I've changed
Baby why you buggin now
I know that I put you through hell
You deserve to be with someone else
But I gotta be straight up (straight up)
Girl I just wanna kiss and make up (make up)
Oo we've been through a lot of things
How do you throw that away
You were the heart of me
