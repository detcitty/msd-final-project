I'm all confused and I don't know what to do
'cause I still can't get over loving you.
I've had time but I can't get you off my mind

No
I still can't get over loving you.

Ev'ry time I run into your friends

I just have to ask them with who and where you've been.
And when they tell me what I really didn't wanna know
It only breaks my heart
makes me want your love.

When I hear your name I get more in save
'cause I still can't get over loving you.
I can't turn it loose though I know it's selfabuse.
I still can't get over loving you.

I've tried to get involved with someone new
But it's just no use 'cause I expect them to be like you.
Baby
