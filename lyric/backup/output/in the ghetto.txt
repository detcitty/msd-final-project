As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago morn
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto (in the ghetto)
And his mama cries

'Cause if there's one thing
That she don't need
It's another little
Hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto (in the ghetto)

People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
