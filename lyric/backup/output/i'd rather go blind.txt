Chorus:
I'd rather go blind, I'd rather go blind
I'd rather go blind, I'd rather go blind
I'd rather go blind, I'd rather go blind
I'd rather go blind, I'd rather go blind
Something that told me it was over with you
When I saw you and that boy were talking, well
Something deep down in my soul just said: 'You're gonna cry babe'
When I see you in that band, you're just a young boy's dream
