Remember when you ran away
And I got on my knees and begged you
Not to leave because I'd go beserk?
WELL

You left me anyhow and
Then the days got worse and worse
And now you see I've gone completely
Out of my mind

AND

(1):
They're coming to take me away
Haha, they're coming to take me away
Ho ho, hee hee, ha ha
To the funny farm
