Bang, bang, shoot em' up, destiny
Bang, bang, shoot em' up to the moon
Bang, bang, shoot em' up one, two, three
(One, two, three, four!)

I wanted to be a spaceman
That's what I wanted to be
But now that I am a spaceman
Nobody cares about me

Hey mother earth
Won't 'cha bring me back down
Safely to the sea
But 'round and around and around and around
