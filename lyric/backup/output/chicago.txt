So your brother's bound and gagged and they've chained him to a chair
Won't you please come to Chicago just to sing
In a land that's known as freedom how can such a thing be fair
Won't you please come to Chicago for the help that we can bring

We can change the world
Rearrange the world
It's dying
To get better

Politicians sit yourselves down there's nothing for you here
Won't you please come to Chicago for a ride
