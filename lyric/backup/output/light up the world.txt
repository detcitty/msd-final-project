Hey-hey-hey you and me keep on dancing in the dark
It's been tearing me apart
Never knowing what we are
Hey-hey-hey you and me keep on tryin to play it cool
Now it's time to make a move
And that's what I'm gonna do

Lay it all down
Got something to say
Lay it all down
Throw your doubt away
Do or die now
Step on to the play
Blow the door wide open like up up and away

Let's light up the world tonight
You gotta give up the bark and bite
I know that we got the love alright
Come on and li-li-light it up, light it up tonight
Let's light up the world tonight
You gotta give up the bark and bite
