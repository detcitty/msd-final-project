Drivin' home this evening
I coulda sworn we had it all worked out
You had this boy believin'
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt, yeah

Well I heard it on the street
I heard you mighta found somebody new - yeah
Well who is he baby? - who is he?
And tell me what he means to you - oh yeah

I took it all for granted
But how was I to know
That you'd be letting go

Now it cuts like a knife
But it feels so right
Yeah! It cuts like a knife
