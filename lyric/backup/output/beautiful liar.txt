Ay
Ay
(Nobody likes being played) Ay
Oh, Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Oh, Shakira, Shakira (hey!)

He said I'm worth it, his one desire
I know things about him that you wouldn't want to read about
He kissed me, his one and only (yes), beautiful liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about

You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer?
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry

Ay! Let's not kill the karma
