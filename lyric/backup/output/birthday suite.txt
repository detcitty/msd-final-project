Have mercy on my eyes
Lady, what'cha wearin now?
You know it's a crime
The way you look in clothes
Girl you take the prize
Five foot five and dressed to kill
Strike my fancy every time
You strike a pose

There's one more outfit
That I ain't seen yet
One more outfit
That looks great I bet

I bet you sure look cute
In your birthday suit
I bet you sure look cute
In your birthday suit
You've got your best feature
Straight from Mother Nature
