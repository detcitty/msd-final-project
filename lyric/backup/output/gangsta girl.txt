Roll, roll, roll

You can catch me in the club with a gangsta girl
When I ride, I'm gonna ride with a gangsta girl
When I smoke, I'm gonna smoke with a gangsta girl
When I freak, I'm gonna freak me a gangsta

I'm lookin' for them gangsta girls, not them fake ass wanksta girls
Just them ghetto fabulous girls, gotta keep 'em in my world
Mama makin' gangsta moves, rollin' with this gangsta dudes
Sittin' on spinnin' 24's, openin' up Bentley doors

Drunk at the party, hands up in the air
But still she sexy when she shake her body
That type of chick that says, "Hey girl, let's go to the after party"
After that we go to my room for the after, after party
Y'all know what happens next

Hypnotiq an' a rated X, got her singin' the greatest sex
Now, on dubs, rollin' up, into the club, raisin' 'em up
Now, we in the back, blazin' 'em up, dice in hand, shakin' 'em up
I need a chick like that to come an' share my gangsta world
An' if you in the club with hands up, you can gangsta girl

You can catch me in the club with a gangsta girl
When I ride, I'm gonna ride with a gangsta girl
When I smoke, I'm gonna smoke with a gangsta girl
