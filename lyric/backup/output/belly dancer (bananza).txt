Hey ladies, drop it down

Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl go Bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey ladies, drop it down

Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl go Bananza

(Hey girl)
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Excuse me, beg your pardon girl
Do you have any idea what you startin' girl?
You got me tingling, come to me mingling
Steppin' off, lookin' bootylicious and jingling
When you walk, I see you baby girl
When you talk, I believe it baby girl
I like that, thick-petite n' pretty
Little touch is a ditty
Love to work the kitty like purr, she loves to stir it up purr
I can hear her purring up
'Cause she? s the type that'll get arousy of
Get you excited and call her boyfriend up
(Oh no)
What's the plan without the plan B

We can meet up at the hutter house for the TV
So stand by like a butty pass
While I watch this beautiful thang shake that ass

Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl go Bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey ladies, drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
