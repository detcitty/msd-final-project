Nightmare!

(Now your nightmare comes to life)

Dragged ya down below
Down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever
(Peace of mind is less than never)

Hate to twist your mind
But God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed
(Burn the world your last endeavour)

Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)

So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time
And nothing stops the madness turning
Haunting, yearning, pull the trigger

You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare!
