I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby

Moonlit sky casts shadows down
Romance in the air is strong
Something's telling me
I need your love

I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
And that's a fact

I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
Where are you at?

Looking glass reflects the moon
Your love's missing from this room
Baby, now I see
I need your love

I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
And that's a fact

I need your loving
I need your kissing, baby
Where are you at?
