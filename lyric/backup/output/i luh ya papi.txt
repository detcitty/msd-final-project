I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you're all that loving that J.Lo, true

Hola, I can get you thrown up
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun up
Gonna tie my hair up top
Put a pin in it, now I'm ready, let it rock
Keep it number 1, that's easy mathematics
Keep it number 1, baby, ain't no static
Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at the legit
No brakes, go green, no red
If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head
Put it on you, I'mma need about 4-5 beds
Cause I love my papi

I didn't see it
But I see it now
I think I love you
And I need you now
Ain't had none like you in a while

I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
Yeah that my papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi

I put it down for a brother like you
