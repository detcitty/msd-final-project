Lately baby, i've been thinkin'
how good it was when you were here
and it ain't the wine that i' ve been drinkin'
for once i feel my head is spinning
But early this mornin', when i opened my eyes,
that old lonesome feelin' took me by surprise
i guess you meant more than i realized
the love we had stays on my mind
the love we had stays on my mind

And pretty girl, i've been rememberin'
