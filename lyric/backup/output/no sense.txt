It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty

And love don't make no sense when it's empty (Oh no)

I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you

The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world

Ain't the same without you
