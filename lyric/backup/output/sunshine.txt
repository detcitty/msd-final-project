Hey, little girl
Stand right there
Sun is shining in your hair

Hey, little girl
Don't you move
Hey, my heart and l approve

Whoa, whoa, whoa
You're my sunshine
Don't you know
I love you, love you
Shine your love on me
Shine your sunshine
By the stars above you
I love you, truly love you


Hey, little girl
Hold me tight
Fall in love
