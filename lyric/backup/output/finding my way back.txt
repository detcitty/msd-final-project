Lights out, sucker punch, striked out
Called it love, we wrote it then I wiped out
Two ships just passin' in the night now
Offshore, lookin' for a lighthouse

Green pill, you said that it was painless
Down and out, drownin' in a sea of my anguish
Funny, you always said hope floats
Comprehended but I can't cope

So I gotta find my way back, way back
To you, baby
