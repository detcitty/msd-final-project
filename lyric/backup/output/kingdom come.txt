I don't know what life will be in H.I.P. H.O.P
Without the boy H.O.V. (I will be, I will be)
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior (Yeah)
So after this flow you might owe me a favor (Yeah)
When kingdom come, you ready? (I will be)
When kingdom come, I'm ready (I will be)
When kingdom come (Yeah, yeah) I'm ready
(Hey! Hey! Hey Hey Hey!!!)

Now everywhere I go they like HOV you back
Up out the corner office out the cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge
I'm C.E.O. and yeah going god
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded
Selling blow in the park, this I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark
I been up in the office you might know him as Clark
