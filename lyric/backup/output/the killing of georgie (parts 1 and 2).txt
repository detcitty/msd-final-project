In these days of changing ways
So called liberated days
A story comes to mind of a friend of mine

Georgie boy, was gay I guess
Nothin' more or nothin' less
The kindest guy I ever knew

His mother's tears fell in vain
The afternoon George tried to explain
That he needed love like all the rest

Pa said, "There must be a mistake
How can my son not be straight
After all I've said and done for him"

Leavin' home on a Greyhound bus
Cast out by the ones he loves
A victim of these gay days it seems

Georgie went to New York town
Where he quickly settled down
