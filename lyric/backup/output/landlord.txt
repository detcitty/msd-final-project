You're the landlord, and the keeper of our love
You're the landlord, and the keeper of our love

Here was a heart, torn apart desperately in need of fixing
I never found a heart, big enough, let alone someone whom I could trust
All of you, opened up to let me see, in your heart there was just you and me
