Yess
What it look like Alc
Tryin' to show the niggas man
It's that Street Fam man, we rep that
Loso
Street fi-di-di-di-dam yes
I'm with 101 niggas, we dalmatian doggy deep (yess)
And fly with the tongue
So if you feeling froggy leap (come on)
Kermit, you better think before you ribbit
Don't get murdered over your song, before you ad-lib it
I pop up like Xzibit, but given I'm at your crib it's
Not to put no fucking fish tanks in your Civic
Fuck getting your ride pimped, you'll get hog-tied wimp
Have you in the trunk curled up like fried shrimp
It's been a good year, maybe I should ride blimp
Cause your boy just stay above the game
They trying to tag him, spray a brother frame
But your shots can't reach me, I'm way above your aim
Go 'head nigga, say another name
Take this family for a joke, play them Wayan brother games
And I'ma Git You Sucka, I be schemin' with this Keenan
Aimin with this Damon, I'm putting that Major Payne in
My Little Man is on ya, Marlon and Shawn ya
Lay the beef on his noodle, make some Luger lasagna
Forty Cal fettuccine, trey pound pasta
You reach for this medallion, you must like Italian nigga
You only see me pushing if the driver's tired
I work the S6 ever since the 5 retired
The drop top, they say it's Ocean Drive inspired
So you can call a cab once your bitch fall for Fab

Uhh, I get money like a muhfucker
Shades darker than a bitch, but I can see
