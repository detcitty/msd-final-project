Dream on dreamer life gets in your way
Dream on dreamer life gets in your way

There you go day and night
Up in the clouds flying so high
You try your best to stretch your mind
Beyond reality and sense and rhyme
You see things make your big heart sing
Like the flowers trees and birds and pretty things
Hate to put your two feet on the ground
