Well my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking. (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree. (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

I fell in fear, upon my back
I said don't look back, just keep on walking. (woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
