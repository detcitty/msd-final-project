I use to pride myself on bein' the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand that anything I'm offerin'
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguin'
From the time I picked you up until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
"It's all his fault again," that's what you're tellin' all ya friends
I ain't pointin' fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how ya day going, I know they stressing on ya
I know them times get hard, that's why I'm checkin' on ya
It's your truly ma, I got a little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl, I can do it betta for ya, 'cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's foreva, it's foreva

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me baby) (ooo girl)
Come on ova to my place (my place) (my place) (ooo naw)
Won't you sit yaself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl
We gon do it our way (ooo naw) (aww yeah)

I heard your friend that told a friend that told a friend of mine
