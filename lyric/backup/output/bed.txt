L.O.S.
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye (repeat 8x times)
Put you to the bed, bed, bed
Put you to the bed, bed, bed
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye

Girl, change into that Victoria Secret thing that I like
Alright
OK, tonight you're having me your way
Perfume, spray it there
Put our love in the air
Now put me right next to you
Fittin' to raise the temp in the room
First rub my back like you do
Right there, uh-uh, right there uh
You touch me like you care
Now Stop
And let me repay you for the week that you've been thru
Working that 9-5 and staying cute, like you do

oh, oh, oh

I love it (I love it)
You love it (You love it)
Everytime (Everytime)
We touchin (We touchin)
I want it (I want it)
You want it (You want it)

I'll see you (see you)
In the morning (In the morning)

I wanna put my fingers thru your hair
