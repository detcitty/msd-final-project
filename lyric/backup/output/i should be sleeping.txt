I never knew there were such great movies on TV at 3 a.m.
I'd never guessed that at midnight Tuesday, I could have pizza ordered in
I've never been a real night owl but these days I'm all turned 'round
There's only one thing I'm sure of right now

I should be sleeping instead of keeping
These late hours I've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move

Even though I'm feelin' so right
