This here’s a jam for all the fellas
Tryin’ to do what those ladies tell us.
Get shot down ’cause you’re overzealous,
Play hard to get, females get jealous.
OK smarty, go to a party,
Girls are scantily clad and showin’ body.
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her,
But you’re standin’ on the wall like you was Poindexter.

Next day’s function, high class luncheon,
Food is served and you’re stone cold munchin’.
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants.
A girl starts walkin’, guys start gawkin’,
Sits down next to you and starts talkin’.
Says she wanna dance ’cause she likes the groove,
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move.

(vocal scatting)
Just bust a move!

You’re on a mission and you’re wishin’
Someone could cure your lonely condition.
Lookin’ for love in all the wrong places,
No fine girls, just ugly faces.
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation.
