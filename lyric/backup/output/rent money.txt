Super
They go crazy
Yeah
They comin' in and out, in and out, in and out
Trap spot boomin'

Got the money comin' in, it ain't no issues
I just a fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
Got the Mac 11 cocked, it got the kick too
Servin' niggas like Doughbeezy in my house shoes
Ya baby mama fuck me better when the rent's due
I just a fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
She sucked my dick, she came home, I bet she kissed you

Treat me like I'm Al Capone, nigga, fuck you
John Gotti, Illuminati, nigga, fuck you
I put a middle finger up, because, fuck you
This money got me geekin' up, nigga, fuck you
Red bottoms with the fur like Frank Luc
I bought some VVS and she caught the chain flu
I fucked this R&B bitch, I should thank you
Yah, I was sippin' my codeine from the beginnin'
She jocked my whole team, she seen who's winnin'
We light Liv up on a Sunday, come see us livin'
This for my dogs on the one way in penitentiaries
Send a direct hit, you gotta pay attention
I just lit my wrist up, I need some more attention
She didn't wanna play fair, I put her on suspension
I put a key on Greyhound now I'm in a new dimension
