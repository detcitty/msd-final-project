Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

I tried to be a boy,
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess,
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong,
That's why I wrote this song

This type of modern life - Is it for me?
This type of modern life - Is it for free?
So, I went into a bar looking for sympathy
A little company - I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said it's always been the same
This type of modern life -Is not for me?
This type of modern life -Is not for free?

American life
I live the american dream
You are the best thing I've seen,
You are not just a dream

I tried to stay ahead,
I tried to stay on top
