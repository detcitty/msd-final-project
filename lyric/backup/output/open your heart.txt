Watch out!
I see you on the street and you walk on by

You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way
I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want, don't try to resist me
Open your heart to me, baby
