Well, here I'm rollin' down another sunny highway
Been in the sun too long
I'm goin' coconuts but least I'm goin' my way
I'll probably be here when the sun goes down

I wanna live it up, wanna quit my job
Tell the boss to go to hell
I ain't complainin', you do the best with what you got
I know you're laughin' 'cause it's easy to tell
