Well I got a good friend who's got a good life
He's got two pretty children and a real nice wife
Yet he never seems quite satisfied
I said I know what's on your mind
But you better think about it before you cross that line
The grass aint always greener on the other side

Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it aint really love and it aint really lust
You aint anybody anybody's gonna trust
