Oh, it's music to my ears
Oh man, how can I describe, the way I feel
Fuckin' great man
Ok, let me see
How could I begin

[Verse 1:]
Locked in mariahs wine cellar all I had for lunch,
Was red wine more red wine and some captain crunch,
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch,
And to soak it up and in between snack, crack ers to munch
Mariah what ever happened to us
Why did we have to break up
All I asked for was a glass of punch
Ya see I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's
Going through your mind after such
A nasty break up with that latin hunk
Luis migul
Nick cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin I want her back ya punk
This is hello kitty bed spread satin funk
Mixed with egyptian with a little rap and punk
Zapp and eric clapton
Shaft, prince, abba, crunk
Ya baby
I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
man I really want you bad you cunt
Nick you had your fun
I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for dracula acupuncture
