I never meant to lie to you
But I needed me an easy way out
I couldn't face the truth with you
Because I didn't want to lose my clout
I always have been good to you
Girl, I promise you that nothing has changed
Momentary insanity
Must be the reason why I did you that way, babe
So now I'm telling everybody
That I, that I know I was a fool
To take a chance of ever losing
And I can't take losing you

So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No, I'm never keeping secrets
Girl, I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you

So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No, I'm never keeping secrets
Girl, I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you
