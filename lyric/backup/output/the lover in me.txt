Talk about the love you're missing
Maybe then it's true
When they say love is blind
I can help you if you listen
I can make you feel good
If you just let my try

If everlasting love is
What you're waiting for
Then that time for you
Just has arrived

So here I am, come walk
Right through my door
And be loved for
The rest of your life

If you talk about good loving
Let's talk about the lover in me
So don't go talk about no other
Just talk about the lover in me

I can give you all the loving
But I gotta know that
You're there to receive
I can be your only woman
But I gotta feel that
I'm all that you need

I'll be your everything
And I can give you so much more
And I'll never leave you
