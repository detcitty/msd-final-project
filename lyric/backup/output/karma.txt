I am the one you denied, brushed off every time I tried
But I'm alright, I'm able to swallow my pride
And put all the bullshit to the side, yf you're ready to ride
I'm down for a one night stand, I'll accept it anyway that I can
'Cuz I ain't your man, I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first, yeah, yeah

I can't keep my eyes off ya
I can tell why them other guys lost ya
The kind's red in a flyin' saucer
And that's why I can offer, similarities in our characters

Haven't ya heard the word 'round town, how I get down?
They gon' whistle, every body part is official
When that ass wit chu, got my dick hard as a missle
Don't hop on top 'cuz I ride around with a pistol

If they pull us over, I'll be outta town with a issue
If you was mine, I'd introduce you to mama girl
You're stylin' in your boots and Gabanna
I'm so used to your Prada, I take trips 'cuz out in Houston it's hotta

Throw in that Al Green and juice the Impala
Lay my jewels on my collar
You had me feelin' like a fool when I holla'd
Tryna squeeze in but you wouldn't bothered
Now I ain't either, soon as I realize that I ain't need her
She in a rush to get close to me but I ain't eager, shit
