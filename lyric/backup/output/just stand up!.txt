The heart is stronger than you think
It's like it can go through anything
And even when you think it can't it finds a way to still push on, though

Sometimes you want to run away
Ain't got the patience for the pain
And if you don't believe it look into
your heart the beat goes on

I'm tellin' you that
Things get better
Through whatever
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up

Don't you know you can go be your own miracle

You need to know

If the mind keeps thinking you've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you don't give up

Who are we to be
questioning, wondering what is what
Don't give up
THROUGH IT ALL, JUST STAND UP!

It's like we all have better days
Problems getting all up in your face

Just because you go through it

Don't mean it got to take control, no
