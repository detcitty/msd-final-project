Well she's kinda pretty, drives a big car too
And when I hold her in my arms, I never know what to do
She's got everything she needs, what does she need me for
Just a crazy fool comin' back for more

And I know she's no good
Can't blame her but I know I should
Everybody says a watch out boy
She'll break your heart like it was a toy
