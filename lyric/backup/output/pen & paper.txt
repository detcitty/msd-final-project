This whole routine is getting old
So am I
And so are you
My reputation lets me know
I can do whatever I want to
Though it seems that you believe
You can do whatever it is you please,
Not before, not before you wind up on your knees

Don't cry to me no more

You like the way the people stare at you
Now you look so fake
Just thought that you should know
