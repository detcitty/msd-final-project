I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart

This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to any one

You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh, yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart
