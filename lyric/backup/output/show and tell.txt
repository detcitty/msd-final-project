These are the eyes that never knew how to smile 'til you came into my life (do-do-do-do-do)
And these are the arms that long to lock you inside every day and every night (do-do-do-do-do)
Girl and here is the soul of which you've taken control
Can't cha see I'm tryin' to show love is right
Whoa oh-oh-oh show and tell
Just a game I play when I wanna say I love you (I love you)
