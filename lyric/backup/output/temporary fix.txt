Saw your body language and I know how you're feeling
You look like the kind of girl that's tired of speaking
Standing with somebody but he doesn't know what you like

You caught my attention, you were looking at me first
All that I can see's you waking up in my t-shirt
If you're not hooked on anything right now, I can be your vice

All you need to know is

You can call me
When you're lonely
When you can't sleep
I'll be your temporary fix
You control me
Even if it's just tonight

You can call me
When you feel like
