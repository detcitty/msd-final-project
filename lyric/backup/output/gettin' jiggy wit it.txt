Bring It
Uh!
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ha Haa, Ha Haa
What, what, what, what
Huuh
On your mark ready set let's go
Dance floor pro I know you know
I go psycho when my new joint hit
Just can't sit
Got to get jiggy wit it, thats it
Now honey honey come ride
DKNY all up in my eye
You gotta Prada bag with a lot a stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin
Everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid
Wish you nig was dancin' the jig
Here with this handsome kid
Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-Cuba
I just bite it
It's for the look I don't light it
Illway the amay on the anceday orflay

Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay

Yo my cardio is infinite

Ha ha

Big willie style's all in it

Gettin jiggy wit it
Na na na na na na na nana
