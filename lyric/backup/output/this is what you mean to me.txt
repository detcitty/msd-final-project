The day you walked into my life, I had nothing
But a cold, lonely feelin' inside
Now I've got love forgiving and a reason for living
And I've pushed all my sadness aside
Now a day without you is like a day without sunshine
A song without a melody
This is what you mean to me, oh baby
This is what you mean to me, I love you
