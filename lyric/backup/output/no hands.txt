Girl, the way you're movin' got me in a trance
DJ turn me up, ladies this yo' jam
I'ma sip Moscato and you gon' lose them pants
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands

Girl drop it to the flo'
I love the way yo booty go
All I want to do is sit back and watch you move
And I'll proceed to throw this cash

All that ass in yo' jeans
Can Wale be, can Roscoe scheme
Long hair, she don't care when she walk she get stares
Brown skin or a yellow bone, DJ this my favorite song

So I'ma make it thunderstorm, Bud, want it, Flocka here
Throw it, fuck it, I don't care, chests flyin' everywhere
Got my partner Roscoe, like bruh, I'm drinkin', help
Can't you tell, booze help me hit them 15 steps so fuck it

Well, I'm tryin' to hit the hotel with 2 girls that swallow me
Take this dick, gonna swallow, that Moscato got her freaky
Hey, you got me in a trance, please take off yo' pants
Pussy pop on her handstand, you got me sweatin', please pass me a fan, damn

Girl, the way you're movin' got me in a trance
DJ turn me up, ladies this yo' jam
I'ma sip Moscato and you gon' lose them pants
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands
