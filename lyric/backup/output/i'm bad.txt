(He's bad...)
Aaaahhhhhhhhhh...

No rapper can rap quite like I can
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso I'm a MC cop
Make you say, "Go L.L. and do the wop"

If you think you can out write me, yeah boy I bet
Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet
Trendsetter, I'm better, my rhymes are good
I got a gold nameplate that says I wish you would

And when battle begins then, I gotta join in and
Before my rhyme is over, you know Im'ma win
Cool J has arrived, so you better make way
Ask anybody in the crowd, they say the kid don't play!

Slaughter competition, that's my hobby and job
I don't wear a disguise, because I don't owe the mob
Got a pinpoint rap, that makes you feel trapped
So many girls on my jock, I think my phone is tapped

I'm bad
