Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me... from me
Life's gotta always be messing with me (You wanna see the light)
Can't it chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain (You wanna see the light)
I'd tried to every night, all in vain... in vain

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace
