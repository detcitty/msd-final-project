Well, my mind is goin' through them changes
I feel just like comittin' a crime
Every time you see me goin' somewhere
I know I'm goin' outta my mind, yeah
Oh, my baby she left me the other day
And we were havin' alot of fun
Oh, she knew I just loved her so
And that's the reason why she had to run

It's all right
You know what I mean
All right
What I say
