It's such a beautiful day that
The sky seems to say, "Good Morning"
Missed the dust off your shoes
Throw away ally our blues and start smiling

Take a good look around
There's no clouds looking down
Upon your way

So, won't you decide
To come back alive
It's a new day

Sunday sunrise shining
Through my windowpane
Chasing away my cares
