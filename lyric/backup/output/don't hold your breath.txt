Don't hold your breath

You can't touch me now, there's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
I was under your spell for such a long time
Couldn't break the chains
You played with my heart

Tore me apart with all your lies and games
It took all the strength I had
But I crawled up on my feet again
Now you're trying to lure me back
But no, those days are gone, my friend
