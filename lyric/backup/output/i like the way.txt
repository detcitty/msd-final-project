I Like The Way (The Kissing Game)
I Like the Way

Verse 1:
All summer long we've been together
And I never felt so good
Cuz when I'm with you
You're such a good time (yes it is)
And when you get next to me
You make my heart beat fast
You throw me bad when you smile
And when we're alone
I know we're in love
Cuz I can't get enough, cuz
