Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will it's just a question of when
I've lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned
But that won't happen to us

Because it's always been a matter of trust
I know you're an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
