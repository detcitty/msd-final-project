Just an old fashioned love song
Playing on the radio
And wrapped around the music is the sound
Of someone promising they'll never go

You'll swear you've heard it before
As it slowly rambles on and on
No need in bringing 'em back
'Cause they've never really gone

Just an old fashioned love song
One I'm sure they wrote for you and me
Just an old fashioned love song
Coming down in three part harmony
