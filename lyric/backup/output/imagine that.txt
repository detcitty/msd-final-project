Imagine That Lyrics

f/ LeShaun

I just want you to fantasize with imagination
Know what I'm saying, uh yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah I like that
Give me some more, some more of my vocals
You know sex 'em up a little bit
You know what I mean?

You're the honey that I see when I'm riding by
The one giving me a feeling that I can't deny
You got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh
Acting like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye
Sometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror
Turn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer
You're turning me on, keep me standing up
I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough
I come up to your job and handcuff your boss
Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
Then sit you up on the copy machine
Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between
Then I'll take you to the window so the world can see
Baby I'm down on my knees let your world be free
Pearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me
Multiple orgasms is your destiny
Wet dream, ride like you're going to Queens
Like I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18
To hell with your boss
Let that nigga hear you scream
Sounding like that screech on the fax machine
Then we can take it to the ladies bathroom
Make your mascara run till you look like a racoon
Touch yourself baby tell me it's wet
Squeeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go

(LL Cool J)
I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)
Have you calling me your ultimate thrill
(Imagine that)
I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill

(LeShaun)
