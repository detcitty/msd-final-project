We make all of our suns the same
Every one will suffer the fire we've made
They all explode just the same
And there's no goin' back on the plans we've made


Peacekeeper, take your time
Wait for the dark of night
Soon all the suns will rise
Peacekeeper, don't tell why
Don't be afraid to fight
Love is the sweet surprise


Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...


Only creatures who are on their way
Ever poison their own, well
But we still have time to hate
And there's still somethin' we can sell
