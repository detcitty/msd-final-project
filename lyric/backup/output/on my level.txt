It's the champagne pourin'
Big joint rollin'
Bombay sippin'
No blunt smoking
Bad bitch gettin'
Thick and she got some friends with her
I take 'em out pourin' shots of liquor
Drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures
nigga, you know everything Taylored
Don't rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper
That's the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passing through
Rollin' doobies up, ya hoe who we pass 'em to
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool
That's what I have to do

See after drinking champagne all night
Never worry bout a damn thing, y'all might
Homie I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeah)
I'm on my level (yeh)

I'm on my level (yeaah)
