Carlos and Carmen Vidal just had a child
A lovely girl with a crooked smile
Now they gotta split
'Cus the Bronx ain't fit
For a kid to grow up in
Let's find a place they say
Somewhere far away
With no Blacks, no Jews and no Gays

But for the grace of God, there go I, I, I
There but for the grace of God, oh go I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
