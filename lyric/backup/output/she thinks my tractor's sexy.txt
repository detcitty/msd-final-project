Plowin' these fields in the hot summer sun
Over by the gate, lordy here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea

I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up the throttle and stir a little dust

Just look at her face,

She ain't foolin' me
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always starin' at me
