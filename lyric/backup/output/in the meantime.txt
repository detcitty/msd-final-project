And in the end we shall achieve in time
The thing they call divine
And all the stars will smile for me
When all is well and well is all for all
Forever after
Living in the meantime wait and see

We love the all the all of you
Where lands are green and skies are blue
When all in all we're just like you
We love the all of you
