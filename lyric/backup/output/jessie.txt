From a phone booth in Vegas Jessie calls at five a.m.
To tell me how she's tired of all of them
She says, "Baby, I've been thinking about a trailer by the sea
We could go to Mexico; you, the cat and me
We'll drink tequila and look for seashells
Now doesn't that sound sweet"
Oh Jessie you always do this every time I get back on my feet

Jessie paint your pictures
About how it's gonna be
By now I should know better
