Oh my my my, what you do to me?
Like lighting when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
You put your body on top of mine
Every time that you lift me up
To the heavens and stars above

Oh, lord have mercy
I'm begging you, please
I'm feeling drained, I need love
You charge me up like electricity
Jumpstart my heart with your love

There's an energy

When you hold me

When you touch me

It's so powerful
