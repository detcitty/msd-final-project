The Georgia courtoom was crowded
As Ellie May took the stand
She was accusing Reverend Joe Henry
Of being a no good preaching man

She said, the Reverend
Partook of my lovely body
The Reverend said, she lies
The jury said, now listen
I'll do the talking and
The courts will justify

The prosecuting attorney
Started pacing the floor
Sweating and making threats

The judge's wife, sitting
Back there in the back row
Said, hey, Judge, I'll check

Cause Reverend Joe Henry
Is a good man
He preached all over
The bottom land

He spoke so a
Child could understand
And there oughta be a
Whole lot more good folks
Like Reverend Joe Henry
