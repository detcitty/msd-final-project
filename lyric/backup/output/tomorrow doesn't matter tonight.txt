You already made up your mind
Just who you're looking for
And what kind of love you'll find

Holding out for a dream
But I can see you're lonely
Living isn't only a fantasy

I don't fit into your plans
But you can reach for my hand

Tomorrow doesn't matter tonight
I'm holding you and it feels so right
I know you didn't plan it this way
