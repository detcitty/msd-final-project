I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
I was under the waves before love rescued me
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

Love comes to town, I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town, I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town
