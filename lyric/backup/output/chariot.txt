Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself we all lost touch
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon, oh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rised
It puts over me

Oh chariot your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your
Strength
