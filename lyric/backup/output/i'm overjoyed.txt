Thinking of you
Brings a smile to my face
Any time, any place I am
And it's the truth
How you take control of emotions
I never knew I had

I'm overjoyed

Of how you're making me feel
I'm overjoyed

Because this time it's real
I'm overjoyed you see
This I can't ignore

Because I'm overjoyed over you
Over you
I'm overjoyed over you
Over you

Each day with you
Is an adventure into paradise, you see
I found something new
Each time I look into your eyes, baby
