Listen to the tracks

Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
You just do you, umma do me, umma do me, umma do me

You wear Reebok, I wear Bally
You smoke Michy, I smoke Cali
You wear Enyce, but I wear Louis
I drop 600 boys on these Guccis

You really like her, you might wife her
I don't like her, so I one night her
You make it sprinkle, I make it tsunami
You get chump change, but I get money

You like dancinâ€™, I just two step
You like to trick off, but I don't do that
You don't tote what, I keep that tooly
Wanna see how it's done? Watch me do me!

You just do you, and what?
Umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
