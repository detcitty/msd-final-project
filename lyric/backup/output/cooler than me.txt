If I could write you a song*
To make you fall in love,
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used to palm all my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like,
You're cooler than me.
And you never say hey,
Or remember my name.
It's probably cause, you think you're cooler than me.

You got your high brow,
Shoes on your feet,
And you wear them around,
Like they ain't shit.
But you don't know,
The way that you look,
When your steps
Make
That
Much
Noise.
Shhh
I got you,
All figured out,
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Girl, your so vain,
You probably think that this song is about you.
Don't you?
Don't you?

If I could write you a song,
To make you fall in love,
I would already have you up under my arm.
