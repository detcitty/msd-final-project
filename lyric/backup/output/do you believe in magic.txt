Do you believe in magic
In a young girl's heart
How the music can free her
Whenever it starts

And it's magic if
The music is groovy
It makes you feel happy
Like an old-time movie

I'll tell you about the magic
And it'll free your soul
But it's like trying to tell
A stranger bout rock and roll

If you believe in magic
