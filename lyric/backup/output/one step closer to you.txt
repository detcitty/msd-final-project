Ain't it funny
Destiny is pulling you back to me
Time waits for no one
I hope that nothing has changed
I've been thinking
I was taking more than I ever gave
I never thought
You knew the rules to my game
Here I am, turning back the pages
Of the book we wrote
Every word can be recreated
I want you to take no more

I'm coming one step closer to you
Now I'm on my way
Coming back to stay
