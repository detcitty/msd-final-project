No-no-Notorious. Notorious. Ah. No-no-Notorious

I can't read about it
Burns the skin from your eyes
I'll do fine without it
Here's one you don't compromise
Lies come hard in disguise
They need to fight it out
Not wild about it
Lay your seedy judgments
Who says they're part of our lives?

You own the money
You control the witness
I'll leave you lonely
