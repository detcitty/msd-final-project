Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike

He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man

She brings home her pay for love
For love

She says: We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love -
We'll give it a shot

Wooah
We're half way there
Woah-oh
