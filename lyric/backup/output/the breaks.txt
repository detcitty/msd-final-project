Clap your hands, everybody,
If you got what it takes,
'Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know
That these are the breaks,

Brakes on a bus, brakes on a car,
Breaks to make you a superstar,
Breaks to win and breaks to lose,
But these here breaks will rock your shoes,
And these are the breaks,
Break it up, break it up, break it up!

If your woman steps out with another man,
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And she runs off with him to Japan,
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And the IRS says they want to chat,
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And you can't explain why you claimed your cat,
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And Ma Bell sends you a whopping bill
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
With eighteen phone calls to Brazil,
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And you borrowed money from the mob,
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And yesterday you lost your job,
