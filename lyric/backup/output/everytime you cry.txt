I'm not the one to tell you what clothes to wear.
I'm not the one who talks about your hair.
I'm not the one to show you how I feel inside.
I'm not the one to say how much I care.

Everytime you cry just a little bit, cry just a little bit,
When you say good bye I die just a little bit, cry
just a little bit more.
