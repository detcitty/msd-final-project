I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right...
As I, turn up the collar on my
Favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on
The wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the Man In The Mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have
Been any clearer
If they wanna make the world
A better place
Take a look at yourself
And then make a change
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed - out dream
(Washed - out dream)
They follow the pattern of
The wind, ya' see
Cause they got no place to be
