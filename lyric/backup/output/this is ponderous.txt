This is ponderous, man
Really ponderous

I had this dream the other night
I went to work one day
And nobody remembered who I was
So, I decided to take the day off

On my way out
I run into my boss and he says
Hey, you look familiar
I said, thanks, people say that
A lot in these dreams

Then the horns kicked in
And my shoes started to squeak

Then all of a sudden
I'm standing on a beach
In some tropical part of the world
And there's this sign that says
