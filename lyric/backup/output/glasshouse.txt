If you're living in a glass house
Don't throw no stones
If you're living in a glass house
Don't throw no stones
 
We're born and alone
And we die alone
What can we do in between

I don't what's going on in your house
When you close your door
If you stop looking in my bedroom window
I'll stop looking in yours

And she caught me with Alice
