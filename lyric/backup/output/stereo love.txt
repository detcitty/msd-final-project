When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one,
Paying for the things I never done.
Don't let go, don't let go to my love.

Can I get to your soul?
Can I get to my thoughts?
Can you promise we won't let go?
All the things that I need.
All the things that you need.
You can make it feel so real.

'Cause you can't deny,
You've blown my mind.
When I touch your body,
I feel I'm losing control.
'Cause you can't deny,
You've blown my mind.
When I see you baby,
I just don't wanna let go.

When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one,
