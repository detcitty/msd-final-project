It's summertime!
Ladies lookin' hot
Shakin' up what they got!
Elephant Man an' Kat, c'mon!

Senses tellin' me you're lookin', I can feel it on my skin
Boy I wonder what would happen if I trip and let you in
Don't be shocked by my aggression, i just might be the one
Let's skip this conversation, just whine your body up

Ha ha ha, don't wanna wait no more
Ha ha ha, you've got what I'm searchin' for

I'm feelin' your vibin' I'm ridin' high, it's exotic
And I want you, and I want you here
Pull me closer and closer and hold me tight to your body
I wanna feel you, I wanna feel you near!

Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oye!
