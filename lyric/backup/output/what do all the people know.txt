You know I told you once tonight
That you could always speak your mind
You work so hard to say what's right
I watch you do it all the time

And when I called you on the phone
You said that I could be the one
But here I'm standing all alone
And you're out lying in the sun

Tell me, am I getting in too deep?
Every night I'm talking in my sleep
Lately I am been so confused
I really don't know what to do

Could you be the one I'm thinking of?
Could you be the girl I really love?
