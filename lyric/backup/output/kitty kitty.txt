[{the fellas}]
[(the ladies)]

[Chorus [2x]:]
{Here kitty-kitty, here kitty-kitty-kittyyyyy!}
Aw, kitty kitty!
{Here kitty-kitty, here kitty-kitty-kittyyyyy!}
I thought I saw a puddy tat!

[Bridge A 2x:]
(What you doin'?) {Nuttin', hon! Uhh, uhh, I'm just nuttin', hon!}
(What you doin'?) {Nuttin', hon! Aww, honey-hon!}

Like I said, the party ain't dead,
These girls ain't even scared to give head!
[Verse 1:]
Girl, stop tryin' to be smooth
Make way for a brother to make the first move
You're tryin' to act nice and sweet
'Cause I know that you is a freak
So let a brother lick them paws
And run the tongue on the g-string draws
And tease the kitty just a little
Then stick my pole in the middle
Before I hit, let me ask
