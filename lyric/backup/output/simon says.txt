Get the fuck up, Simon says get the fuck up
Throw your hands in the sky
Queens is in the back sippin'
Yak y'all what's up?
Girls, rub on your titties
Yeah, I said it, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee, pity the fool that
Act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

y'all know the name
Pharoahe-fuckin'-Monch, ain't a damn thang changed
You all up in the Range, then your shit's inebriated
Phased from your original plan, you deviated
I alleviated the pain with a long-term goal
Took my underground loot without the gold
You sold platinum round the world, I sold wood in the hood
But when I'm in the street, then shit it's all good
I'm soon to motivate the room, control the game like Tomb Raider
