Well a good way down the rail-road track,
There was this little old run down shack
And in it lived a man I'd never se-e-e-een
Folk said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you'd better not set foot on his land
But I didn't think nobody could be that mean

So I took me out walking down the rail-road track
I was gonna go down to that little old shack
An' just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And he growled at me and I swallowed hard
