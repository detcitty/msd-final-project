So sweet you are
Like a shining star
You brighten my whole world
You bring me joy just being my girl

Everything's good about ya
I couldn't live without ya
You're so sweet, you're so fine
I'm so thankful that you're mine

Full of clover bustin' out all over
You're the summer in the park
You're the candle in the dark
