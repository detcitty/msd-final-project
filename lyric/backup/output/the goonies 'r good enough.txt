Here we are hanging onto our strains
Of green and blues
Break the chain and we will break down
Oh it's not real if you don't feel it

Unspoken expectations
Ideals you use to play with
They've finally taken shape

What's good enough for you
Is good enough for me
What's good enough
Is good enough for me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
