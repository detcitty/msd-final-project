Ooh, I can see that you've got fire in your eyes
And pain inside your heart
So many things have come and torn your world apart

Oh baby, baby, baby
Don't give up
Don't give up
Don't give up

(If you want love)
If you want love, you've got to give a little
(If you want love)
If you want faith, you just believe a little
(If you want love)
If you want peace, turn your cheek a little

Oh, you've got to give
You've got to give
You've got to give to live
