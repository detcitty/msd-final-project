every oth-every other time

I said lets talk about it
as she walked out on me and slamed the door
but I just laugh about it
cuz shes always playin those games

C'mon
(deep down) deep down i know she loves me
but shes got a funny way of showin me how she cares (she cares)
last night she did a donut on my lawn
and drove out w/ her finger in the air
Oh yeah

Sometimes its black
Sometimes its white
Sometimes shes wrong
Sometimes im right
Sometimes we talk about it or we figure it out
But then she just changed her mind
Sometimes shes hot
Sometimes im cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when i think about it im so in love with her

Every other time

Every other time
