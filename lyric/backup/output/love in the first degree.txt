I once though of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be.
So long ago, I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free.
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time.
I never thought that I would get caught.
It seemed like a perfect crime.

Baby, you left me defenseless,
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
