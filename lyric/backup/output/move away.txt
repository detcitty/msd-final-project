Moving, moving
Move away
Move away

Spirit changed the conversation
Stepping stones across the land
I never wanted to be a hero
I never wanted to be a man

I hurt you darling
I made you cry
I hurt you darling
Don't ask me why

Move, move, move away from me darling
I never said I'd hold your hand
Move, move, move away from me darling
I never said I'd understand
If I could say this was Judgment Day
