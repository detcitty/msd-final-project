Okay
This is a song that uhh
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and uhh
Not too many Chanukah songs
So uhh
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to hear any Chanukah songs
Here we go!

Put on your yarmulke
Here comes Hanukkah
So much funukkah
To celebrate Hanukkah

Hanukkah is
The Festival of Lights
Instead of one day of presents
