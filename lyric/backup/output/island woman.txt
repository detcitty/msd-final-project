I found myself on my knees in prayer
The consequence of my deep despair
Now I must speak, get it off my chest
It ain't no joke and it ain't no jest
Every night she would come to me
But her demands brought disharmony
I said, "You can't bring your drums to bed
Your rhythm method's gonna leave me dead"
Got to take this woman
(Take this woman)
'Cause she's a whole lotta woman
(Take this woman)
Why don't you take this woman
(Take this woman)
Take this woman, lock her away
It would be churlish of me to complain
