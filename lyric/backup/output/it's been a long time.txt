Been such a long time, since I saw you
Tell me, girl, how long has it been
I'm so glad to see you 'cause I really love you
You were my only friend

You for me and me for you
Oh, listen, baby
You for me and me for you

It's been such a long time, girl, I still love you
I guess I always will
But in my silent nights, I long to hold you tight
It's you I really need

You for me and me for you
Listen baby
You for me and me for you
Yeah, yeah

Oh, no, no girl

I've been missin' you, baby
Yes, I have
