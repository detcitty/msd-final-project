Writers: Leo Sayer & Tom Snow

standing here alone with you
wondiring what it is that I'm supposed to do
and there you are with the love light in your eye
the bridges are burnt down
your arms are open wide
am I in too deep or should I swim to the shore
is this the real thing?
I don't know but I've never been here before

and I feel a thunder in my heart that I can't control
I feel a thunder in my heart
should I walk away or follow my soul?
I feel a thunder in my heart
where it comes from I just don't know
