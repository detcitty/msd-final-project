Can't Get Enuff (4: 19) (Winger/Beach)

You don't make it easy, you never keep it straight
But you're so damn sexy, I can't keep away
I need your love, I need your skin
I need you baby to let me in


I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough, it's never enough
I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Baby, give it up, cause I can't get enough (huh)
