Really, get smacked silly, you get smacked silly
Fucking with these niggas from the, what you gonna do
When you ready, shit I was born ready
And I was all ready on fish and spaghetti

Creep with the culture, rap I can coach ya, attack like a vulture
If I said I get cha, wearing it I'll fit ya, y'all thirteen inches
I see the big picture, if it's to get richer, I'd probably get wit' ya
If not burn it, get hot like a furnace

Shoot the video motherfuck city permits
We own the city, on the phone with Diddy
Red bone pretty, when she get aroused like to suck her own titty
Put it in the video, ya wanna holla got to follow nigga here we go

Get you ticket, the train, don't miss it
Won't reach out, and ya bet I won't visit
Till my whole wardrobe is-it listen

Make this money
Take this money
(Let's get it)
Ain't no way you can take this from me
(Let's get it)

Ain't shit funny
Shake it honey
(Let's get it)
Take it money
Now let's get it
(Let's get it)

Creep with your people, though my shit is sweet and low it's no equal
Front butch look, once I throw the hook you proceed to get cook
With the game and the soldiers sit
When I came, the game that I owed you one

Wide big Lincoln, why he died on the side for the stinking
Watch the task force task for look Marlboro
It's a big chance, big pants
Might guard him with my man's a type barber

Better learn quick, 'cause my clique don't argue
You ain't my crew, then who are you
For we take off make sure that your seated
Billboard read it believe it

Make this money
Take this money
(Let's get it)
Ain't no way you can take this from me
(Let's get it)
