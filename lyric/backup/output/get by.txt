(Talib)
Yeah. my Lord. yeah

(Verse 1: Talib)
We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk at the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too, like "Attack of the Clones"
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers, spirits stay mute while you eagles spread rumors
We survivalists, turned to consumers
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself, with no help
I think about a struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words, melt in my mouth
They hot, like the jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Core bailed me out
To get by. just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like Bed-Stuy through the red sky with the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some G. Rap shit, "Livin' to Let Die"

(Chorus: Background singers)
