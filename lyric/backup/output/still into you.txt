Can't count the years on one hand
that we've been together
I need the other one to hold you,
make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park to love each other
But when our fingers interlock,
can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies...
but I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights...
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
