One two three four

Oh you get me ready
In your '56 Chevy
Why don't we go sit down in the shade
Take shelter on my front porch
The dandelion sun scorching
Like a glass of cold lemonade

I will do the laundry
If you pay all the bills
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone
