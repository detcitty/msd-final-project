Somebody once told me
The world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb
With her finger and her thumb
In shape of an "L" on her forehead

Well the years start coming
And they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense
Not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do
So much to see

So what's wrong with taking the back street
You'll never know if you don't go

You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now
You're an all star
Get your game on
Go play

Hey now
You're a rock Star
Get the show on
Get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place
