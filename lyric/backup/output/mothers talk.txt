My features form with a change in the weather
Weekend
(We can work it out)

When the wind blows
When the mothers talk
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the mothers talk
When the wind blows
(We can work it out)

It's not that you're not good enough
It's just that we can make you better
Given that you pay the price
We can keep you young and tender
Following the footsteps of a funeral pyre
You were paid not to listen
Now your house is on fire
