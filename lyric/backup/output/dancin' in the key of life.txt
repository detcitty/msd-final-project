I wake up in the morning
Thinking of you
Get out of bed and
Put on my dancing shoes

Hey, hey
I don't have a worry
Not a care in the world
I'm dancing in time
With my favorite girl
Don't you know that

(CHORUS)
Dancing feet
Dancing in the key of life
Dancing feet
Dancing in the key of life
Dancing feet
Dancing in the key of life
