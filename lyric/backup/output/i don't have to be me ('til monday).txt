I got me a brand new car
Waitin' in the driveway
Shinin' like a bright new star
I've be wishin' on it every day
To take me away from here

So I called in to where I work
Told a little white lie
No my back don't really hurt
But that's my alibi
My temporary ticket to anywhere but there

Call it an early weekend
Call it goin' off the deep end
Call it what you want
