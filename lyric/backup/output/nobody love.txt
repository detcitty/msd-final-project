Okay okay
Why? Why?
Okay okay
Everybody's looking for that something
No one ever wants to pay the price
Everybody's scared of going nowhere
But we ain't going anywhere tonight!

I should be more cynical than tell myself it's not okay
To feel this good when I'm with you
Tried my best to fight it, say I hate you
But I always stay!
Oh ooh ooh oh oh

Ain't nobody love
Ain't nobody love like you do!
Ain't nobody love
