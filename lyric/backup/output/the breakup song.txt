We had broken up for good just an hour before
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, aaah
Now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancin' 'cross the floor
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, aaah
And then the band slowed the tempo and the music gets you down
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, aaah
It was the same old song with the melancholy sound
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, aaah
