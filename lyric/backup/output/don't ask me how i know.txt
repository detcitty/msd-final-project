Don? t ride your bike off a ramp
That? s more than three bricks high
Don? t take a candy from the store
If you ain? t got the dime

Don? t pick a fight with a little guy
That doesn? t talk that much
Don? t pick up a cherry bomb thinkin? it? s a dud
And don? t sneak out of a two story house
Usin? bed sheets for a rope
Don? t ask me how I know

Sell your truck while it? s still runnin?
Save the Jesus off the dash
Say a prayer when you feel like cussin?
