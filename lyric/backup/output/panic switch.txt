Time is never worth my time
Moonshine bleeds into my eye
I still sleep on the right side
But the white noise can't leave the scene behind

Could I be anything you want me to be
If so is it meant to be seen

When you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch, are you pistol whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?

When you see yourself in a crowded room
