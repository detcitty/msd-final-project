Starry night, sunny days 
I always thought that love should be that way 
Then comes a time that you're really in doubt 
You've loved all you can and now you're all loved out 
Ooo baby we've been a long long way 
And who's to say were we'll be tomorrow 
Well my heart says no 
But my mind says it's so 
We've got a love
