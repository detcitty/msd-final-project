No
Is not an answer
On and on I try to understand you see

Love
Is only letters
Until you prove your love is here inside for me

Can you feel it (feel it)
Or can't you see (can't you see)
I'll never hurt someone as much I know

When you see me (see me)
It's what you'll get (what you get)
Until I know it's real it won't change how I feel

(What you don't know)
(Might hurt you)
(What you don't know)
Don't know, don't know
(If you don't know)
If you don't know
It won't hurt you
(What you don't know)
Don't know
What you don't know might hurt you, ooo ooo ooo

You (You)
You play with fire
I know one day you're gonna be the one to burn
Love (Love)
Is like a game haaa
What goes around comes around you wait your turn
