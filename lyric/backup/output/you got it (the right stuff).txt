The right stuff
The right stuff
First time was a great time
Second time was a blast
Third time I fell in love
Now I hope it lasts
I can see it in your walk
Tell it when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts

You've got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You've got the right stuff, baby
You're the reason why I sing this song
All that I needed was you
Oh girl, you're so right
And all that I wanted was you
You made all...

My dreams come true
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
The right stuff
