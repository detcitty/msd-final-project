Don't do no drugs
Ain't got the time
I keep it straight
But I don't mid
Cause I got love
That the only plan
I'm just a satisfied man.

Ain't no girl
Can turn my head
Cause I got better
Waitin' on the bed
She does it all
Everything will wait
Makes me a satisfied man.

Chorus:
Oohh I'm so satisfied
Yea I'm so satisfied
Oohh I'm so satisfied
Satisfied man.
In the world
