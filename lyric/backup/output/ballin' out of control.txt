Chiti-chiti-bang-bang
Don chi chi
(That's me)
Rollin wit'cha nigga Nate D
You know these niggas straight bang
Big game D, ballin' with the 21st Street

Chiti-chiti-bang-bang
Don chi chi
(That's me)
Still makin' tight-ass beats
I'm rollin' in my brome, I stay sweet
Ain't nobody ballin' like me

It goes, mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the biggest baller of all
I got a 700, a Bentley and a Magine
The girls just die when I'm ridin' past

Live life like I'm sellin' pies
Ah-rabian with two or three wives
Two or three houses to hide, ten cars that's parked outside
And they all got bodies that's wide, follow me

As the Leer jet flies, over Crimson Tides
Four bedroom duplex in the sky
Nicknamed Lottery 'cuz I don't stop spendin'
When the wheels stop, the chrome keep spinnin'
