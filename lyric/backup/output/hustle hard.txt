Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle
Hustle, hustle, hustle

Same old shit, just a different day
Out here tryna get it, each and every way
Mama need a house, baby need some shoes
Times are getting hard, guess what I'ma do

Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Closed mouths don't get fed on this boulevard

Big bank in my pocket
Double up with my profit
See this shit then I cop it
Gimme that there and then drop it

Homie, hold up with my mojo
Peep the whip and the logo
24's and they low pro
I bet she fucking, I know so

Nigga ain't no doubt about it
Riding 'round with that rocket
Load it up and I cock it
Send 'bout a couple off in your nog
