Your mama packed yall up and moved you to the south
Packed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you

M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that deed
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting on me to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak, moonlit
