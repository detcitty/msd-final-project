Take time to realize
That your warmth is
Crashing down on in
Take time to realize
That I am on your side
Didn't I, didn't I tell you
But I can't spell it out for you
No it's never gonna be that simple
No I can't spell it out for you

If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other
And we'll never find another
