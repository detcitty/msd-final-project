Fuck all you hoes
Get a grip mothafucka
Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers
That told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin'
In front of that called the police on me when I was just tryin'
To make some money to feed my daughter

And all the niggas in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?

It's all good baby, baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl

I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match

Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade

Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri

Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
