Yes, the name of this shit here
Is Leflaur Leflah Eshkoshka
The Fab 5

Yes yes y'all (yes y'all)
OGC, Heltah Skeltah be the best y'all (best y'all)
Fab 5 slam from East to West y'all (West y'all)
Sound pound straight through your bubble vest y'all (vest y'all)
And check yo' chest y'all (chest y'all)

Ay Caramba, Starang, Gunn Clappa Numba
One on the set man I cut you like lumber
Still play the back in my thunder gear, down to my underwear
Make all you motherfuckers wonder where
I come from, cause motherfuck Dapper Dan
I'm a Gun Clappa fam plus I run rappers man
Fab 5 mad live blow up the spot
Dru Ha gets the paper, Black Moon still gets the props

A-yo next to snap a neck be big R-O-C-K
Send MC's to me in squads of three say
Rockness Monsta, is he for real, it can't be
See him in action as he transform, that man's me
Enemies ain't Kotter, ain't no welcome back in my home
Knots get blown like quarter slots in payphones
Phone home or return like Jedi
I bet I can without la give your stupid ass the red eye

Me nah lie
Niggas who can't see pass a likkle bit of light
You come tes' the champions ya gon' die tonight
And six feet deep is where you sleep
