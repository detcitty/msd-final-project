It felt so easy in the morning sun
When love was in season, I was on the run
I was lookin' for trouble and the thrill of the chase
Love was lookin' at me eye to eye, face to face

One touch should've told me, try and understand
Love was always a long shot to a gambling man
With a roll of the dice, girl, I threw it away
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and day
