T-T-T-T-This is the moment that I take over your mind frame
Step into the picture that I paint using my brain game
I'll elevate you so high I'll give you a migraine
Over and over, put it on replay, 'til you're insane
This is a rollercoaster that's about to be long gone
Once you jump in, won't wanna get off, buckle up and hold on
Just let it go, give it up, allow yourself to transform
Follow me, follow me to a place unknown of no return

Are you ready, ready, ready to go-g-go?
Are you ready, ready, ready to go-g-go?

Bionic, take ya supersonic, ey
