I almost got drunk at school at 14
Where I almost made out with the homecoming queen
Who almost went on to be Miss Texas
But lost to a slut with much bigger breasts
I almost dropped out to move to L.A.
Where I was almost famous for almost a day
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost loved you
I almost wished you woulda loved me too

I almost held up a grocery store
Where I almost did five years and then seven more
