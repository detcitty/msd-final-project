If you're bleeding, then everyone can see you're bleeding
They can call for the doctor
Who'll provide what the diagnosis says you're needing
Then he'll take away your pain

But if your heart, your heart has been broken
And you don't wear it on your sleeve
No one can tell, your hell goes unspoken
But there's one thing you must believe

Time heals the wounds, no one can see
Time heals the wounds that no one can see
Time heals the wounds, no one can see
Time heals the wounds that no one can see
