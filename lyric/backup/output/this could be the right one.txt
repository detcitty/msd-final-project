This could be the right one, I'm not really sure
This could be the right one, I've never felt love like this before
I'm actin' like a lover that's out of control
Makin' you promises and actin' a fool
I'm goin' through somethin' that I don't understand
I know that I need you and I'll do what I can, cause

This could be the right one (this could be the right one)
This could be the only one (this could be the only one)
This could be the right one, this could be the one we're waiting for
This could be the right one (this could be the right one)
This could be the only one
