Well the wife went out of town 'bout a year or so back
And left me at home by myself to batch
And after five straight nights of TV I was ready to scream
So I called up this beer drinkin' buddy of mine
I said, "Bill, I ain't havin' a real good time"
He said, "Why don't we go to the rasslin' matches
And let off a little steam?"
The main event was the Spider from parts unknown
With his trusty partner, the Blue Cyclone
They was takin' on a team that never had been beat
Now I'd never seen the matches before
And the crowd was backed up plumb out the door
But me an' ol' Bill lucked out and got ringside seats
Well then they rang the bell and all Hell broke loose
My legs was shakin' like a rubber goose
I'd never seen anything like this, not even in the war!
The Cyclone put the Vulture in an airplane spin
Then he body slammed him and he did it again
I swear, I didn't see how that old boy could take much more
It was right about then in the thick of things
My buddy Bill threw a chair in the ring
And that's when I knew we'd better be headin' for the door
'Cause I saw the Cyclone lookin' at us
And he was rubbin' his head and he started to cuss
And I knew if he caught us he'd break Bill's neck for sure
