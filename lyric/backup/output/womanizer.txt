Superstar
Where you from, how's it going?
I know you
Got a clue what you doing
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Look at you
Gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you
Got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, you-you are
You, you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just-just what you are are-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just-just what you are are-are
(You) You got me going
(You) You're oh, so charming
(You) But I can't do it
(You) You womanizer

Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just-just what you are are-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just-just what you are are-are
