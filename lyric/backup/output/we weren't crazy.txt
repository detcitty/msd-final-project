We headed out to California
Everybody tried to warn us
Said we wouldn't make it any further
Than that worn out Chevy would

We broke down a time or two
Thought "maybe we didn't think it through"
We were all we had to turn to
When it wasn't lookin' good

We're lookin' back laughin'
'cause they called us crazy
