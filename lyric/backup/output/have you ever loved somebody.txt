Oooh, have you ever...
Have you ever loved, loved, loved

You keep running, running away
I know you can't run forever
You think you're heading for a heartbreak again
Just as you did before

I can teach you how to love again
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how...

CHORUS
