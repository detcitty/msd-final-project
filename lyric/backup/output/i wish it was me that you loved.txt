Oh, oh, Lord
All alone again
You say it's been this way
Since you don't know when

There are a lot of places
A woman like you could go and see
Why your man won't take you
Is a mystery to me

Oh, I wish, how I wish
It was me you loved
Baby, I wish, how I wish
It was me you loved

Honest to God
Such a pretty thing
