All up in my face, you not from the clique
Give me space, we might rob the shit
Most hate it, baby they don't love the clique
I thought they love you when you make it
This some other shit, yeah
Yeah, yeah, this some other shit
Friends and business don't mix so I'm brotherless
Tryna get back close, hit 'em with the stiff
Gears I shift, make sure they feel the drift
Just copped the Benz all with the tint
You should know cause in every song I said this shit
Yeah, in every song I said this shit
I'm just proud of my accomplishments
I'm a 4Hunnid nigga, I don't care at all
Have her suck dick, lick the head and all
Heard you talkin' 'bout I'm real, I'm fraud
Your kids and broad, they straight, you shouldn't care at all


Please, please tell me why you always hatin'
Why you hatin'?
Please tell me why you always hatin'
Please, please tell me why you always hatin'
Why you hatin'?
Please tell me why you always hatin'
Please, please tell me why you always hatin'
Why you hatin'?
Please tell me why you always hatin'
