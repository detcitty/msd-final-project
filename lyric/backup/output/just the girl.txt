She's cold & she's cruel but she knows what she's doin'
She pushed me in the pool at our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams but I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems, she's the one I'm after

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself, I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery, she's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for
