Girl, ladies, let your hurr down
Let your hurr down
We's about to get down

Oh my, oh my, oh my god
This girl straight and this girl not
Tipsy off that peach Ciroc
Like la la la
Ching-a-lang-lang, ching-a-ling-a-lang-lang
Jeans so tight I could see loose change
Do your thang, thang, girl

Do that thang like la la la
Tell them pretty faced girls tryna grabs each other
And them undercover freaks who ain't nun' but trouble
Baby, I'mma tell you some' only cause I love ya

People all around the world sexy motherfuckers
Get ugly
Yeah, get ugly, baby
Get ugly
You're too sexy to me
