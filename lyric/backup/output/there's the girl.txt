You're a polished diamond, now you're feeling kinda rough
Yes I know how long you been searching for the perfect touch
You better hear what I say
I can tell your eyes are just about to give you away

'Cause there's the girl that you were after
Feel your heart beating faster now
There's the girl that you were after
Can you say that you don't want her anymore?
