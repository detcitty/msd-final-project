We the motherfuckin best nigga
Ace Hood
Super, Future

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating
(Turn Up!)
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Niggas be hatin I'm rich as a bitch
100K I spent that on my wrist
200 dollars, I spent that on your bitch
Do me a model, put that on my list
Oh there he go in that foreign again
Killin the scene bring the ner in
Murder she wrote, swallow or choke
Hit her and go home, I won't call her again
Woke up early morning, crib as big as a college
Smoke me a pound of the loudest
Whippin some shit with no mileage
Diamonds cost me a fortune
Them horses all in them Porsches
You pussies can't hardly afford it
4, 200 my mortgage
Ballin on niggas like Kobe
Fuck all you haters you bore me
