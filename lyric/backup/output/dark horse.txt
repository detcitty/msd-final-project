You thought that you knew where I was and when
It looks like they've been foolin' you again
You thought that you'd got me all staked out
But baby looks like I've been breaking out

I'm a dark horse
Running on a dark race course
I'm a blue moon
Since I stepped out of the womb
I've been a cool jerk
Who's looking for the source
