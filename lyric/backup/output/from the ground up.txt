Grandma and grandpa
Painted a picture
Of 65 years
In one little house

More than a memory
More than saying I do
Kiss you goodnights
And I love yous

Me and you, baby
Will walk in their footsteps
Build our own family
One day at a time

10 little toes
A painted pink room
Our beautiful baby
Looks just like you

And we'll build this
Lo-ove
From the ground up
Now 'til forever

It's all of me
All of you
Just take my hand
And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be

And we'll build this
Lo-ove
