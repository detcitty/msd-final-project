The two of us are one of a kind
A combination ain't easy to find
Why do I get a feeling from you
Things ain't right, do you need something new?

Knowing how both of us live
Leaves us so little to give

If I could grow wings
I would do anything
Just to keep you with me
Can't you see?

If I could fly high
I would give you the sky
Don't you make that mistake
What does it take?
