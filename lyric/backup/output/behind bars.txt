(warren g)
Check this out, this warren g, y'know what I'm saying
Chilling wit my man slick rick, you know
And we gonna give you all a little tale about this jail stuff
You know, so rick, why don't you run it homie, yea

(slick rick)

In the slammer kid but I'm innocent
Lord played witty wasn't having any pity
Now wit razor blades, did he
Cry suppose the situation seen mad eyes of foes
Drives a rolls, hey, yo, money, what size are those
Need to phone me toanothe sprang up, hm, to gang up
On the skid, housing the phone like he didn't know how to hang up
Would be hard though ought a minute or so and then yells time on a
And when you get your commisary, buy this and that or else I'm gonna
Be on that ass and won't stay off, extort, fig I say, way off
Beaten death, you ain't protecting me, forgot today's my day off
Hold my head and drift the? sumo weighing nuts and cars?
Instead of sitting here accumulating cuts and scars, behind bars

Chorus:
Dum ditty dum ditty ditty datty day
This type of shit happens every day
Take some punk locked up to get beat down, ripped down to his boots is broke
Down
Dum ditty dum ditty ditty datty day
