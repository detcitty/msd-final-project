Oh, look out, oh uh, come on
What'chu like, a whole lot of, whut? (Tyrese yeah)
What'chu like, me on a, whut? (What'cha like, what'cha like?)
What'chu like? (Can you tell me, baby)
Why, how?
All night long (All night long)

I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian with
Good conversation plenty big faces
It's a must I stay luxurious
Jewelry cut precision like I bust
Been winnin' since Funkdafied blew up
It's evident, shit I can't be touched
Niggas say I'm too much, I trust it's true
Why lie? See for yourself when I slide through
Drive by, your bitch say don't look, you do
Shine so bright in the wet U2
You wish boo boo could ride with you tonight
Ain't nothing in the world that Brat can't do
She attractive to them, him, her, and you shit
Frostbit, December Unrestricted
Drop dead, the cost is priceless
Due to the content I suggest you'll like this

What do you like?
A whole lot of foreplay
Right before you get it started
What do you like?
Me on top
You on the bottom, tight body
What do you like?
