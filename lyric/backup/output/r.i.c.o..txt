Alright
Old ways, new women, gotta keep 'em balanced
The girl of your dreams, to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleepin' off on me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
