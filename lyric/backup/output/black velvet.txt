Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancing' with a baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky
The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
