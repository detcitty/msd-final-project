The look of love is in your eyes
The look your heart can't disguise
The look of love is saying so much more
Than words could ever say, yeah

A look my heart has heard
My, my takes my breath away
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I've waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
