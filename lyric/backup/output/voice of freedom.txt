Williams Freedom
Freedom
Voice Of Freedom
I'm back with a new track
This ain't fiction it's fact
I made the rules that will make you wanna groove
That'll make you wanna prove my moves are all that
Dance till you feel like I feel now
Grab your girl and just move that's how
Now is the time, now is the year
And this is the world premiere!

(Chorus)
