These last few weeks with you
Have been the best of my life
And it's a cold winter's night
That we'll be saying goodbye
When you're all alone somewhere
On a cold winter's day
Remember these warm summer nights
And the promises that we made

I'll be missing you
After September
I'll be wanting you
So always remember
How I loved you girl
