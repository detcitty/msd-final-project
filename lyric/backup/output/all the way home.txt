Wait a minute baby, going too fast
I'mma turn back, ohhhhh
Wait a minute baby, going too fast
I'mma turn back
Don't even know what we fighting for
Damn I need a minute, so baby keep your distance
Heard it all, so I'mma just go

Don't bother waiting up, I just need some time alone
Damn where the hell are my keys

I just wanna leave, get in my car, and I'mma just drive, all night
Turn off my phone, radio on, and drive
SoI'm just
Speeding down the road, and my head out of control
Cause I'm thinking about you all the way home
Got a long way to ride and I can't even deny
