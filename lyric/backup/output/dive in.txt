Ooh I'm about to dive in ooh ooh
I was thinking about taking a couple laps, I just wanna dive in
Yeah, dive in, yeah-eah

Splash, baby girl that's your water fall
Feel it coming down on me, so crazy
Yeah, girl I love the way your body talk
Come a little closer just like that
Keep on talking girl you got me

Wanting to go deeper then you'll ever know
Wanting to feel, the way you flow
Ooh you got that look up in your eyes
What we 'bout to do ain't no surprise

I'm about to dive in
Baby girl hold your breath
We about to get so wet
Swimming in your body, let me dive in
You know ain't no running 'round this pool
