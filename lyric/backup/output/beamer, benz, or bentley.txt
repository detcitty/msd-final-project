Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
My jeans are never empty b-tch
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Your scheming don't affect me

I'm fresh Im fly, Im so damn high
more than 500 horses when I roll by
I'm calm I'm cool, everything brand new

I don't hand cuff you can get the whole damn crew

Get in my Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
Beamer, Benz, Or Bentley
beat it I bet she let me
she been fiending since she let me
I'm the coolest sh-t especially when I throw on all my Gretzky
got my sm-sm-smith and Wessie to protect me so respect me
this is heavy new Bentley
color vanilla and cherry Andretti on Pirelli make a movie out the getty
wear my ring and my confetti and I'm Kobe Bryant ready
pink rose and chronic smelly while stumbling out the telly
Im so fly Im so ferry and the way I flow is very
ginsu and machete, when my pencil move it's deadly
platinum band platinum bezzie
make a straight girl out of lezzie
machine, mac, dessi keep my windows like the prezzie
