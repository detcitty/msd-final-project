(featuring Eddie Levert)

All your friends are telling you
You should have a fancy car and diamond rings
But Girl you know all good things come in time

Girl you know I'll do just about anything
To see a smile upon your face
So don't let your friends go messing with
your mind

Girl you know there ain't nothing
I won't do for you and Baby don't
Don't ever doubt my love 'cause it's true
