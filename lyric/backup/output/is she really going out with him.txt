Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (where?)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
