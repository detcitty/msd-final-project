Hep beraber önce sağdan
Şimdi sol hadi patt

She called and said that i had mail
Waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could i know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face
With my own destiny

Oh and we sat there talking just like we were old friends
Oh and I asked her, "Can i see you again?"

And she said, "Yes!"
