Excuse me, madam
You're standing still in a no parking zone
You don't get a move on that body
I'll be forced to give you a ticket so get with it

There's a party tonight, you're in a red light zone
If you don't want a ticket you better move on
If you break the law you gotta pay your dues
Ain't much better if you play it by the rules

'Cause it's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy to rock it with your body, baby
It's so easy, it's so right
It's so easy if you drive it all night

No parking, baby
No parking on the dance floor
No parking, baby
