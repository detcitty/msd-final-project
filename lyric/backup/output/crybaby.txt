Yo what's happenin'?
What you're cryin' for?
You know you look too damn good to be cryin'
Come here
How about a player
DPG style, you know, you know

When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby I cry

Okay so it's 5 a.m and I still can't sleep
Took some medicine but it's not working
Someone's clinging to me and it's bittersweet
'Cause he's head over heels but it ain't that deep

I finally changed my number got a different pager
Then last Saturday your cousin called to say you're
Tryin' to reach me probably because you see that
I'm with someone new

Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone
In my new friend's home
On my tippy toes
So that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me
