I was feelin' like
A prisoner inside myself
I saw you
Lookin' like you might be
In a mood to try
Anything that was new

Don't be starved for
The love and laughter
Break through, touch a stranger
You only get one life

This night could be
Like no other night
With you and me
Find the fire in our hearts
And dance in the light, yeah

We'll take our chances
