Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow, out.
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's, out

Shame, on me.
To need, release.
Uncontrollably...

I-I-I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-o-o all the dir-ir-irt
I got running through my mind...
