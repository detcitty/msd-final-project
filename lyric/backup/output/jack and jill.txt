Jack, wanting someone to feel
Sat up on the hill and
Waited all day for Jill

Jill, always away from home
Never bothering to phone
Always leaving poor Jack alone

Now why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
He snuck down the hill
'Cause he needed love
Love he couldn't get from Jill
Oh, yes he did

Why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
He snuck down the hill
He needed love
Oh, yes, he did
Love he couldn't get from Jill

Jack like Little Red Riding Hood
Always trying to do good
