R.I.P we just killed the club
Drank patron out the bottle almsot killed a thug
Im so high I can't feel the drugs
Too many haters sitting here
I dont feel the love
R.I.P 
R.I.P
R.I.P
R.I.P
R.I.P we just killed the club
Took patron to the head almsot killed a thug

Im in a brand new drop top 'Rari with 3 bitches
Tired being in the middle of trial with 3 snitches
And I hit up every club in your city
Where niggas at?
I be in every club in the hood
Where niggas at?
Pull up, jump out stuntin like I was Baby
On my cocaine cowboy shit, like in the 80's
Who the nigga think he is
Slick Rick or Dana Dane
Think he Rakim or somethin, look at his chain
Myself, from head to toe, Im Dougie Fresh
Looking like I came to play, Mitchell and Ness
Any nigga with a watch like that
He need attention
Your man dont ball out like that
