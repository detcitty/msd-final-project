Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes
'Cause you love me
(I'm sorry but so sexy)

So, you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe 'cause you love me
(Uh, you do it well)

So then we tried, ain't feeling this love now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched
(Fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up
(Tear ya ass up)

I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin'
(You know I want ya, babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know, I want ya
