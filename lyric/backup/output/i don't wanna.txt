Ooh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, yeah

I don't wanna be
(Be without ch'ya, be without ch'ya)
I don't wanna live
(Live without ch'ya, live without ch'ya)

I don't wanna go
(Go without ch'ya, go without ch'ya)
I don't wanna
(Be alone)

When we hooked up we sat down
Made an agreement, we vowed that
That we'd always be together
Through whatever

We said that no one ever would get between us
So love will never ever leave us
That was a while ago, oh

But now lately it feels like
I mean I feel like, all we do is fight
Every single night can't make it tight
Can't get it right, I just wanna go back

Take it way back, all the way back
Can we start again? Do it over?
Can we straighten' it out?
Can we work it out? 'Cause

I don't wanna be
(Be without ch'ya, be without ch'ya)
I don't wanna live
(Live without ch'ya, live without ch'ya)

I don't wanna go
(Go without ch'ya, go without ch'ya)
See sugar I don't wanna
I don't wanna be alone

I don't wanna be
(Be without ch'ya, be without ch'ya)
I don't wanna live
(Live without ch'ya, live without ch'ya)

I don't wanna go
(Go without ch'ya, go without ch'ya)
