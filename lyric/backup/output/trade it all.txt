This moment they all been waitin' for, playboy
We here now
We're in the house now, for sure

Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

I assume I'm so into you
'Cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends with you
If they ask, I ain't gotta say whom in them interviews
My sweet thing never believe them rumors that been untrue
In fact I had numerous friends is true
But you was wifey could change me into a groom in a minute boo
Maybe my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they can make a perfume from the scent of you

I wanna take you where it feel like June in December too
So what you think about Cancun till the winter through
I don't know what the other consumers you been with do
I put a daytime to go to bloomies and spend with you
Like any other man I would have zoomed to the clinic too
Ma I wanna see if me and my junior's identical
A dude put a wound on the skin of you
I swear to everything that same afternoon I'll be interviewed, feel me

Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Come here, girl, come and take a walk with me
So I could take you places you don't often be
