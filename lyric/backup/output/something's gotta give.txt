Jenny got a job, a cat named Jake
31 candles on her birthday cake
Next year

Thought by now she'd have a man
Two car seats and a minivan
But it still ain't here (hey)

Alright

She been lookin' for Mr. Right so long
But all she found is Mr. Wrong
And that's the pits

She's drawn a line that she won't cross
And her and time are facing off
She says something's gotta give

Somethin' gotta give me butterflies
