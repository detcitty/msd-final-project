From all the things you've seen
And if you trust in me
I can be that through anything you need
And give it all to me, baby
Don't you run from me, baby
I'll give you every little piece of me
No, I won't leave out a thing, 'cuz I
I know you've seen a lot of things in your life
got you feeling like this can't be right
But, I won't hurt you, I'm down for you, baby
I know you've seen a lot of things in your life

It got you feeling like this can't be right
But, I won't hurt you, I'm down for you, baby
