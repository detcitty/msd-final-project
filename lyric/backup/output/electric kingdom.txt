Huh, deep in the city people live in the streets
You got to be careful of everyone you meet
There's lootin' and shootin', people stabbin' and grabbin'
The innocent by stander, the police are grabbin'

Ain't it a pity 'cause you hate the city
But the way you feel ain't no big deal
You've got to survive and that the real nitty gritty
You go uptown, downtown, you've got to turn your life around

Back in the jungle a man is free
Free from the street, from captivity
Break out, break in, it doesn't matter where you've been
Snake pit, lion's den, you need someone to be your friend

Come to Electric Kingdom
Truck to Electric Kingdom
Come to Electric Kingdom
