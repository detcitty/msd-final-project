I sometimes wonder why
All the flowers had to die
I dream about you
And now, summer's come and gone
And the nights they seem so long
Come on over tonight
Come on over
It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you
By the firelight
If it don't feel right
You can go
Oh-oh, when the cool night
Brings back memories
Of a good life
When this love was not so old
