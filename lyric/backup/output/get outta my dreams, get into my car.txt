Hey (hey) you (you)
Get into my car
Who me?
Yes you
Get into my car
Uuuoooooooooooh... Hah!

Who's that lady
Coming down the road
Who's that lady
Who's that woman
Walking through my door
What's the score
I'll be the sun
Shine on you
Hey Cinderella
Step in your shoe
I'll be your non-stop lover
Get it while you can
Your non-stop miracle
I'm your man

Get outta my dreams
Get into my car (get in to my car)
Get outta my dreams (get in the back seat baby)
Get into my car (beep beep, yeah)
