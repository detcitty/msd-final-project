Poppin' bottles in the ice
Like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right
Gettin' slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride
Like Three 6
Now I'm feeling so
Fly like a G6
Like a G6
Like a G6
Now I'm feeling so
Fly like a G6
Like a G6
Like a G6
Now I'm feeling so
Fly like a G6
Gimme that Mo-Moet
Gimme that Cry-Crystal
Ladies love my style
At my table gettin' wild
Get them bottles poppin'
We get that drip and that drop
Now give me 2 more bottles
'Cause you know it don't stop
(808) Hell yeah
Drink it up
Drink-drink it up,
When sober girls around me
They be acting like they drunk
They be acting like they drunk
Acting-acting like they drunk
When sober girls around me
They be acting like they drunk
Poppin' bottles in the ice
Like a blizzard
