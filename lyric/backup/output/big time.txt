I'm on my way, I'm making it
I've got to make it show, yeah
yeah

It' so much larger than life
I'm gonna watch it growing

The place where I come from
Is a small town
They think so small
They use small words

But not me
In spite of that
I worked it out
I've been stretching my mouth
to let those big words come right out

I had enough
I'm getting out
To the city
The big, big city
I'll be your big noise
