Touch me in the morning
Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday

(Hey!)
Wasn't it me who said that
Nothing good's gonna last forever?
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together?
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand you're feeling that way
