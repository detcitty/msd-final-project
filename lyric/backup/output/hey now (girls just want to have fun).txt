I come home in the morning light
my mother says when you gonna live your life right
oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones
and girls they want to have fun
oh girls just want to have fun

Hey now, hey now
What's the matter with you?
Girls just wanna have fun now
come on...

The phone rings in the middle of the night
my father yells what you gonna do with your life
oh daddy dear you know you're still number one
but girls they want to have fun
oh girls just want to have

That's all they really want
some fun
when the working day is done
