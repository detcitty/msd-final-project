I don't love you anymore
It's just that simple
No, no, no, not like before
Such a shame, dirty shame

We can't work it out
No, not this time
We can't be together
We can only be friends

You gotta respect each other
You gotta reply to your lover
It could never be,
It could never be like it was before,
You don't know what I'm talkin' about

I don't love you anymore
It's just that simple
