Why don't you sit right back?
And I, I may tell you a tale
A tale of three little pigs
And a Big,

Bad
Wolf
Well, the first little piggy, well, he was kinda hick
He spent most of his days just a dreamin' of the city

And then one day, he bought a guitar
He moved to Hollywood to become a star
But living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city
Built his house out of straw, what a pity

And then one day, jammin' on some chords
Along came the wolf, knocking on his door
Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin

Little pig, little pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin
Well, I'm huffin', I'm puffin', I'll blow your house in
Huffin', puffin', blow your house in

Huffin', puffin', blow your house in
Huffin' and a puffin' and I'll blow your house in
