Shorty you keep playin' with my mind
You tease me all the time but I had enough
Maybe I should ask your girlfriends why
Why you are so afraid to fall in love

Girl I won't get next to you
You know I don't like sweatin' you
But something 'bout the way you make me feel
You got me in this fantasy
And all my friends keep tellin' me
Shorty's kinda hot, so what's the deal?

'Cause we been spendin', rollin', livin', showin'
We got some time for play
But you've been player hatin', waitin'
For this rhyme to pass away

Shorty you keep playin' with my mind
You tease me all the time but I had enough
Maybe I should ask your girlfriends why
