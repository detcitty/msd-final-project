Kindness in your eyes
I guess you heard me cry
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
I'm blessed I know

Heaven sent and heaven stole
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all this pain
I thought I never feel the same about anyone or anything again

But now I know
When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
