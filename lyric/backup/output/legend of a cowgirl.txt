I'm gonna drink my whiskey
I'm gonna have my man
I know you got nothing to say
I'm gonna have my man
Gonna steal their hearts
and save them for another day
Ain't gonna hang my hat
Ain't gonna take off my boots
Ain't nothing gonna stop me in my pursuit
My stage, time to rehearse
Gonna see all the wonders of the universe

CH: Pack my bags and mount my horse
I'm gonna ride on into the next town
Spend all my money on absolutely nothing
Need no man to pay for anything
Ain't got no shame, nobody knows my name
