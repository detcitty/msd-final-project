Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Yes I can, doubt to believe what I know what's his plan
Pull me, grab me, grab till the bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip
Like you the one drinking that god sip dot com
Now I gotta work with your tone
How many rolling stones you want
Yeah I got a brand new spirit
Picking it when it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Top like a winner
G5 dealer, U.S to Taiwan
Now who can say that, I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack
