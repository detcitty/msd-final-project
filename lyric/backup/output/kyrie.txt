Kyrie eleison
Kyrie eleison

Kyrie
The wind blows hard
Against this mountainside
Across the sea into my soul
It reaches into where I cannot hide

Setting my feet upon the road
My heart is old
It holds my memories
My body burns a gemlike flame
Somewhere between
The soul and soft machine

Is where I find myself again
Kyrie eleison
Down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison
Through the darkness of the night
