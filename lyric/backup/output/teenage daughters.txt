I ain't complainin', but I'm tired
So I'm just sayin' what I think
And if we're being honest
Then honestly I think I need a drink

My baby's growin' up
She thinks she's fallin' all in love and that I hate her
At seventeen, she's just like me when I was seventeen
So I don't blame her

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
What are we gonna do?
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
What are we gonna do about it?

Remember when we used to be
Everything they'd ever need
We had them believing we were cool

It's like it happened overnight
