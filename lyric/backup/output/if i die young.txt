If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Uh oh uh oh

Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colours, oh and
Life ain't always what you think it oughta be, no
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life well
I've had just enough time
