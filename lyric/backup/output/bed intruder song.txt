Well, obviously we have a rapist in Lincoln Park
He's climbin' in your windows
He's snatchin' your people up
Tryna rape 'em so y'all need to
Hide your kids, hide your wife
Hide your kids, hide your wife
Hide your kids, hide your wife
And hide your husband cuz they're rapin' everybody out here
You don't have to come and confess
We're lookin' for you
