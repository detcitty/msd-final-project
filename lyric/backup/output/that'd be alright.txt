(Mark D. Sanders/Tim Nichols/Tia Sillars)
 
 If money grew on hackberry trees,
 If time wasn't such a luxury;
 If love was lovesick over me:
 That'd Be Alright.
 
 If I could keep the wind in my sails,
 Keep a hold of the tiger by the tail;
 A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail:
 That'd Be Alright.
 
 Yeah, That'd Be Alright.
 That'd Be Alright.
 If everybody, everywhere,
 Had a lighter load to bear,
