I've been up and down
I've been all around
I was mystified
Almost terrified
But late at night I still hear you
Call my name

I've been on my own
I've been all alone
I was hypnotized
I felt paralyzed
You broke my heart and I still can
Feel the pain

I've been a gambler but I'm nobody's fool
And I sure know something, sure know something
