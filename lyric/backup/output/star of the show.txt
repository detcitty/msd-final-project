Walking down the street, hand in mine
It don't keep them other guys
And their wondering eyes from looking at you
That's alright and that's ok
Who can blame 'em anyway?
You're so pretty, and you ain't even got a clue


Cause everywhere we go girl
You're the star of the show
And everybody's wondering and wanting to know
What's your name?
Who's that girl, with the prettiest smile in the world?
