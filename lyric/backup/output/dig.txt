We all have a weakness
But some of us are easy to identify
Look me in the eye and ask for forgiveness
We'll make a pact to never speak that word again
Yes, you are my friend
We all have something that digs at us
At least we dig each other

So when weakness turns my ego up
I know you'll count on the me from yesterday
