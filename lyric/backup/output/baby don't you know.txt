One more time
Well we play that funky music
And we were looking so good yeah
Electrified funky feeling
Was coming down like I thought it was
So we went out on the road yeah
Try to get ourselves ahead
And on the way I was surprised to discover
That all those funky people
Had been mislead they were selling out

Black now, white right oh what a sight
I really didn't know the suckers was white
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know, 
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know
That the honkey's got soul
Baby don't you know, Baby don't you know,
