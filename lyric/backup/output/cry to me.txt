"baby, i see you packing
But it's no surprise for me
You see, i knew it was coming for a long time
Say what? no, no i won't cry
You see i'm a big girl now, and i just can't cry no more
But there's something i want you to know:
That i love you, i love you, i love you!
And there's one more thing i want you to know:
That if you ever need a friend
You can count on me
And honey:"
If you're falling down
And you can't seem to stay on the ground
And when friends get few
I'll be there to get you up
