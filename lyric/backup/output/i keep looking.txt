"That cracks me up!" ...laughter...

Back when I was young
Couldn't wait to grow up
Get away and get out on my own
And looking back now
Ain't it funny how
I've been trying to get back home
Yeah

When my low self-esteem needs a man-loving me
And I find me a perfect catch
Then I see my friends having wild weekends
And I don't wanna be quite so attached
Just as soon as I get what I want
