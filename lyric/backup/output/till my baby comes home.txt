There's a whole lot of girls
Messin' around trying to get me
They do things 'cause they know
My girl is away they try to upset me

They can't believe I resist how can I hold out
Where is that girl now but the truth really is
I don't worry 'cause I love my baby so

And no matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up till I get enough
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

If she stays away for long
She calls me on a phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

I get weak in the knees
My hands start to shakin', head gets the achin'
Is she thinkin' of me or feelin' the fire
With some other guy, yeah

I can't believe I can be worried about her
I shouldn't doubt her
'Cause our thing is for real and I don't worry
'Cause I know, I know, I know
