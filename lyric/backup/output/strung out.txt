One very happy, warm summer night
I saw your face, what could I do
So carefully, I walked straight up to you
Under the shadows of a moonlit night
I saw those eyes shining through
Oh heart of gold, I love you misty blue oh, blue
Well, it's hard to love somebody
Especially when they don't belong to you
'Cause they're lovin' someone else
