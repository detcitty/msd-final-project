Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey

Hey Mickey
You've been around all night, and that's a little long
You think you've got the right, but I think you've got it wrong
Why can't you say goodnight? So you can take me home Mickey?

'Cause when you say you will, it always means you won't
You're givin' me the chills, baby, please, baby don't
Every night you still leave me all alone Mickey

Oh Mickey, what a pity, you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
