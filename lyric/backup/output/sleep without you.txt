Oh babe
Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waiting on a goodnight kiss
Sipping 90 proof, talking to the moon
Counting down the hours till it's 2 a.m.
Never thought I would be like this

But as long as the night ends with you
in a yellow cab shooting me a text saying "coming home soon"
As long as I can bet on ya crawling into bed after slipping out your high heel shoes
I ain't lying, saying "Have a good time,
out with your girls, girl do what you do"
