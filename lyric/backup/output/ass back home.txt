I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn't be long,
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
