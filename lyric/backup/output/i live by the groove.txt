Hey

Everybody loves to feel the beat
From Malibu to 42nd Street

I like to groove
No matter where I am
From Detroit City down to Alabam

It has moved me heart and soul
So I do believe
It's a whole philosophy to me

(CHORUS)
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can't feel it, baby
I can't move
I live by the groove
I live by the groove
If I can hear it, baby
I can't lose

A good groove will
