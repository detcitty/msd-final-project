If you ain't got two kids by 21, you're probably gonna die alone.
At least that's what tradition told you.
And it don't matter if you don't believe, come Sunday morning
You best be there in the front row like you're supposed to.

Same hurt in every heart.
Same trailer, different park.

Mama's hooked on Mary Kay.
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down.
Mary, Mary quite contrary.
