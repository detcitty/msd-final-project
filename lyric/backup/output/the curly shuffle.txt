When me and my friends go out on the town
We can't sit still and we can't sit down
We don't like to fight and we don't like to scuffle
But we dance all night doing the Curly shuffle
(Hey Moe hey Moe) hey Moe hey Moe
(Well nyuck nyuck nyuck nyuck) well nyuck nyuck nyuck nyuck
(La da dee la da dee) la da dee la da dee
(Woo woo woo woo) woo woo woo woo
Well we never miss a chance we get up and dance and do the Curly shuffle
