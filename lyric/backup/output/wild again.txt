A diamond sun cuts down a frozen winter sky
As the world and I go screaming into the phantom night
It doesn't matter where it leads, I got nowhere left to go
If there's any chance at all, it's somewhere down this road

Chorus:
To be wild again, no one's child again
Yeah I wanna see those eyes in the mirror full of fire again
