Just tell me what you've got to say to me

I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth
It comes as no surprise at all you see
So cut the crap and tell me that we're through
Now, I know your heart, I know your mind

You don't even know you're being unkind
So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways
Just use me up and then you walk away
