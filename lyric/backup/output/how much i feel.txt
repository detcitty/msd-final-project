But I don't know how this whole business started
Of you thinkin' that I had been untrue
But if you think that we'd be better parted
It's gonna hurt me but I'll break away from you...

Well, just give me the sign
I will be gone... yeah...

(that's how much I feel)
Feel for you, baby
(how much I need)
Well I need your touch
(how much I live)
I live for your loving
That's how much that's how much
That's how much that's how much
Oooh
