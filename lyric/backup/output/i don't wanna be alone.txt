Lady, I hope we can be together soon
Lately, I'm waking up every day at noon
And maybe, all the meaning is just a minute or two
With you, alone with you

And I know we said we wouldn't
Ever overcrowd each other
But now that we are lovers
I just want you here with me

I don't wanna be alone tonight
I don't wanna be alone 'cuz I don't feel like it's right
I don't wanna be alone, tonight
I want you to come, come and be with me
Let's discover ecstasy
