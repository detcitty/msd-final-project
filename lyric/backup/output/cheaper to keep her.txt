If you`re tied up
You`d better stay tied up
Cause it`s cheaper to keep her
This is from T services

It`s cheaper to keep her
It`s cheaper to keep her

When your little
Girl make you mad
And you get an attitude
And pack your bags

Five little children
That you`re leaving behind
Son, you`re gonna pay some
Alimony or do some time

That`s why
It`s cheaper to keep her
Help me say it, y`all
It`s cheaper to keep her
(It`s cheaper to keep her)

See, when you get through
Staring that judge in the face
You`re gonna wanna cuss
The whole human race

That`s why
It`s cheaper to keep her
(It`s cheaper to keep her)
(It`s cheaper to keep her)
(It`s cheaper, it`s cheaper)
(It`s cheaper, it`s cheaper)
