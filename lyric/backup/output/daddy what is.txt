Daddy What If
Recorded by Bobby Bare with Bobby Bare Jr.

Daddy what if the sun stop shining
What would happen then

If the sun stopped shining you'd be so surprised
You'd stare at the heavens with wide open eyes
And the wind would carry your light to the skies
And the sun would start shining again
