Hey baby
You've been on my mind tonight
I'm so lonely I just had to sit down and write
I spent all yesterday
Trying to figure out what i'm gonna say
One letter from the heart
Is so hard to start, baby
How's your momma how's the weather
How's that son of mine, yeah

Hey baby
Been a long time since we made love
I'm stone cold, the bed's hard, and the work is tough
I'm never gonna leave you again
This job ain't worth the pain
No money in the world
