Y'all cant deny it, I'ma fuckin rider
You don't wanna fuck with me (yeah)
Got skills in the trunk with me (ok)
Switchin lanes, do a buck with me (that's right)
Y'all cant deny it, I'ma fuckin rider
You don't wanna bang with me (yeah)
And you know I brought my gang with me (ok)
Niggaz trip, I got my thang with me

Yo, if they want it, cowards get it
They still wonder how I did it
Now y'all wit it, these niggaz see how I spit it
Huh, these bitches see how I kit it
You can hear my coupe a block away
Bitches be yellin, "Let Me Ride" like they Snoop and Dr. Dre
I keep spittin, them clips copped on those calicos
Keep shittin, with ziplocks of that cali dro'
Keep hittin, and shift blocks for that cali dough
Keep gettin, my tip rocked by them cali hoes
It's William Bonnie, stealin mamis
Dance closely, even know they feel I'm limey
