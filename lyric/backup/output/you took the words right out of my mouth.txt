[Spoken:]

[Boy:] On a hot summer night,
would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
[Girl:] Will he offer me his mouth?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Will he offer me his teeth?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Will he offer me his jaws?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Will he offer me his hunger?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Again, will he offer me his hunger?
[Boy:] Yes!
[Girl:] And will starve without me?
[Boy:] Yes!
[Girl:] And does he love me?
[Boy:] Yes.
[Girl:] Yes.
[Boy:] On a hot summer night,
would you offer your throat to the wolf with the red roses?
[Girl:] Yes.
[Boy:] I bet you say that to all the boys!

[Sung:]

It was a hot summer night 
beach was burning
fog crawling over the sand
When I listen to your heart I hear the whole world turning
I see the shooting stars Falling through your trembling hands

You were licking your lips and lipstick shining
dying just to ask for a taste
(oh now) lying together in a silver lining
By the light of the moon
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment
Not another moment to waste
