Well I bumped inside the magic man
And he laid some tricks on me
He said, "You do need help my friend"
I whispered... "Obviously"
He laid a spread of Jacks and Queens
And he bade me take my pick
But every face it had your face
I cried out, "I am sick"

Sick of hauling your love around
Want to run my train alone
But the engine tracks straight through your heart
And weighs me like a stone

Oh, it's a hard load to love you
It takes up all my time, having you
So familiar
Like last life's
