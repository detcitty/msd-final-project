Moving in, making my connection
Something's up, you can feel it in the air
Private eyes, never know who's watching
Playing cool, you haven't got a prayer

Have you heard the news making all the headlines
Zooming via satellite?
Have you heard the news coming through the grapevine
Fletch is working overtime

Bit by bit, one way or another
Bit by bit, running undercover
Tonight can't lose, making all the headlines
