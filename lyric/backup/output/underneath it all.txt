There's times when I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me like

no one else
And behind your dark glasses
You're, you're something else
You're really lovely, underneath it all

And you want to love me, underneath it all
I'm really lucky, underneath it all
And you're really lovely
You know some real bad tricks

And you need some discipline
But lately, you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
