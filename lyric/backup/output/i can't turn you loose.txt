Do it, do it, hey

Got to, got to feel it
Yeah, sock it to us now

I can't turn you loose now
If I do, I'll lose my mind
I can't turn you loose now
I got to love you all the time

I can't turn you loose now
If I do, I'll lose my mind
Can't turn you loose now
I got to love you all the time

Hip shaking mama, I told you
Ooh, you got to do
Anything you wanna

Yeah, got to, got to love you
Yeah, let me, let me hold you
Yeah, let me, let me squeeze you
Yeah, hey, hey

Can't turn you loose now
Because you a pretty little thing
I can't turn you loose now
