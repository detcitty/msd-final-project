Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We in the club singing this for money, ha!

I'm a gigolo, spending lot's a dough
You can tell the way wide-body, sitting on four's
How I'm shining, wit the fresh, fresh clothes
Always surrounded, by so many
I'm a gigolo, always on the go
Every time I turn around, I got another show
In the club, hit about three in a row
Drop in the six, 'cause I love them

Shorty I, only got one night in town, tell me baby where you down
Bushes we won't beat around, bushes we just eat 'em now
Feeling yo masqueno blouse, seven jean, black and Lebanese
Head to her knees, please if you ever need a bachelor remember me
Just rock to the melody, I got you in bed wit me
I thought you would never leave you wanna name Melike A-Merie
Know the chain freeze wrist be the same degrees
Tryna get lil' mami, in that thang of Reese
Only getting in for free, if you came wit me

'Cause I'ma grown man, not B2K
If I need a girlfriend, it won't be to-day
No, I'm not tryna be ya man, pimp bones in my body
