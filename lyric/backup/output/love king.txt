L to the O, V to the E
K to the I, N to the G
I don't know how he treat you, how they do it where you at
But all I'm tryin' to say is you should know me like that

I'm just sayin'
(It's the R&B Killer)
I'm just sayin'
(You should know me like that)
It's the R&B Killer

I'm in the H-A-W-A-I-I
Dream dropped another one, tell them niggas bye-bye
I got girls in the club, girls in the church
Pull 'em all day, I take 'em off work

Got girls in the draft, girls on my label
Girls at the bank, 'cause I'm about my paper
Got girls with weave, girls without it
She like, "This all mine", hmm, I doubt it

Girls in New York, girls in L.A.
Got girls in Miami or wherever you stay
Got girls in Chicago, girls in Toronto
Girls in Paris, go anywhere I want to go

Half to my main girl, quarter to my side chick
I be on that fly shit and you be on my shit
Your nigga keep playin', change where you layin'
I'm just sayin'
