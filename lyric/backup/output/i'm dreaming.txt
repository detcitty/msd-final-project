Watching all the fishing boats coming
Lying back in the warm, soft sand
Seeing you with the sun in your eyes

Looking 'round with the wind in my hair
Easing down without a care
Touching you under sweet summer skies

There's a place I can go to any time
I feel myself unwind
And oh, the feeling's fine
