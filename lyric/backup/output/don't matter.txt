Konvict, konvict, konvict

Oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh

Nobody wanta' see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you babe)
Nobody wanta' see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you babe)

Cause we gonna fight, oh yes, we gonna fight (we gonna fight)
Believe we gonna fight (we gonna fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah (right to love, yeah)
Nobody wants to see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you)

Nobody wanta' see us together
Nobody thought that we'd last forever
I feel them hoping and praying
Things between us don't get better (better)

Men steady coming after you (you)
Women steady coming after me (me)
Seems like er'body want to go for self and
Don't wanna respect boundary

Telling you all those lies (oh, ooh
Just to get on your side (side)
But I must admit there was a couple
