(Steve Dorff / Molly Ann Leikin)

It's like looking in the window of a fine boutique
Knowing there is nothing that I could ever buy
Still I want your love so much that I could die
But I just can't lead a double life
Being one man's lover, one man's wife

But you can start a fire raging
Just by touching me
Even though I know we're not supposed to touch, no
