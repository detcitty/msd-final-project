(Greatness + Greatness = Great Greatness)
Hey! Hey! Hey!

The way we get loose, we move our shoulders
Forwards, heads back
Get it in control like Janet Jack
Get it on the floor, let them know what’s happening

L.I.L. you better ask somebody
I been on my grind since butt touch potty
Y’all don’t really want it with the Yung God Toddla
With a flow so spec like technolotta

It’s so sick how the clock go tick
Keep giving y’all hits like teckmatic, uh!
That’s the reason why I spit it how I spit it
When I spit it’s like mucus, gotta get rid of it

These chicks don’t pop like me
Uncompatible girl, no comparing me
And ain’t none of y’all scaring me
Like don’t you wish your girl was as bad as me?

Yeah! With a flow so sick like Twista
So sweet, what could be cold like Mystic
Instincts come so smooth like what is it
BK-H-Dub ours like a wizard

(Shawty get loose)
Baby do what you do let me see you let down your hair
(Shawty get loose)
Hit the dance floor and act like there's nobody else in here
(Shawty get loose)
Krump! Clown! Break it on down baby do your thing
