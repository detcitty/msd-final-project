ooh, yeah, yeah (well, well, well, well)
do you mind if I tell the truth for a second ya'll (tell the truth)
Hey, hey
No, no, no

1:
Maybe I deserve,
to wonder who's callin so damn late
for you to say I'm trippin,
just a homie from up-state (said it's just a homie)
Don't he know, it's one o'clock in the mornin'?
Say it's cool, baby it's cool

Maybe I deserve,
For you to say he's comin into town (later on this
evenin')
and he was just wonderin' if you and him could hang out (oh ho ho)
I don't like it
I know I gotta trust you
It ain't cool, 'cuz I know it's true

Maybe I deserve
for you to go out and find some other guy
maybe I deserve
for you to stay out with him all night
maybe I deserve
