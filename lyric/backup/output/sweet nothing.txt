You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper it's the worst emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
