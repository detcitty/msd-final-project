This what they all been waitin' for
I guess so
They been waitin' for this shit for a long time didn't they
I'ma give it everythin' I got
Ayo Dougie park that X6 around the corner
Ayy I'm just feelin' my vibe right now
I'm feelin' myself

Panda, Panda
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda

I got broads in Atlanta
Twistin' dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Hittin' off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Goin' out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Sellin' bar, candy
Man I'm the macho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me

I got broads in Atlanta
