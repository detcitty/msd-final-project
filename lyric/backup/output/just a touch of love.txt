One two tree hit it
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love
(X4)
Verse 1;
Love has been on my mind for some time now
But you've been the missing link
Of all that whats happened
All the stuff made me
Think that love is not for kids
Refrein;
(All I want is your touch)
So come a little closer
(What's his memory)
Open up your heart and let me in
(Like the bird in the sky)
Love has got me flying in
(And the stars in the night)
Beautiful
(Just a touch of love) (just a touch of love)
Just a touch of loooooove yeah
(Just a touch of love) (just a touch of love)
(Just a touch of love) (just a touch of love)
Ooh just sweet love
(Just a touch of love) (just a touch of love)
