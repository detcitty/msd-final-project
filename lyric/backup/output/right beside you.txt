I'm dancing in the shadows of life
And death is all around me tonight
I miss you making love to me right
Beside myself I'm holding you tight
Someone is waiting for me to rise
And dive into the ocean I cried
And I cried and I cried my baby to sleep
Beside myself my soul to keep

Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always

We're dancing in the shade of the summer sun
The drums are playing
