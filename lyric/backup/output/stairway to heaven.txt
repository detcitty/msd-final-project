There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold

And she's buying a stainnray to heaven.
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall
but she wants to be sure

'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook
there's a songbird who sings

Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
It makes me wonder - and it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west

And my spirit is crying for leaving.
