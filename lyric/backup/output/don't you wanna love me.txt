I stopped by to see you
just the other day
And I wanna say
That I finally realized
the words I love you don't mean a thing

It's so hard for me to see
Because you meant everything to me
But I guess I gotta move on
Even though it hurts I gotta be strong

If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
Cause I don't want you
To do anything, that you don't want to do
