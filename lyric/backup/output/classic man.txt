My name calling all night
I could pull the wool while I'm being polite
Like darling calling all night
I can be a bull while I'm being polite
Like oh me, oh me oh my
I know many women want to be in my life
Like oh me, oh me oh my
Why can't every woman end up being my wife?

Even if she go away, even if she go away
Even if she go away, even if she go away

I'm a classic man
You could be me when you look this clean
