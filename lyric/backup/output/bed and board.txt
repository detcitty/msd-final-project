You know, sometimes a man will
Cause such heartache (yes, he will)
That a woman feels she only take
He'll make all kind of mistakes
(Yes, he will) that cause your
Heart to break

Seems like every day
Is like the one before
The things you used to say
You don't say anymore

Bits and pieces of your time
Are all you can afford
It looks like you just can't see
That there's much more to love

Than bed and board (bed and board)
Bed, bed, bed, bed and board
(Bed and board)

Lying half awake
I hear you switch the light
You turn off the late news
Oh, I'm in luck tonight

You think that making love
Three times a week is my reward
Well, you can't seem to understand
That there's much more to love

Than bed and board (bed and board)
Ooh, baby, bed and board
(Bed and board) oh, don't you know

Don't know what happened
But you've changed somehow
And like a puppet
On a string, baby, oh

You're only going
Through the motions now
You touch me but you don't
Feel anything, anything
