Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Here we are in this
Old smoking room again
If your honey is your pleasure
That's all right

But there's an extra added goodness
In my heart for you tonight
If there's any such thing as a God
He must be here tonight

Ain't saying I'm right
Ain't saying I'm wrong
Ain't saying there's any
Such thing as sure love

Seems we been here
Many times before
It's too beautiful to be true
