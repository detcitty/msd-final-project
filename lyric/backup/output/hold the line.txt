It's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treating my friends
It's not in the way that you'll stay till the end
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you do
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... woah... woah... woah
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time... woah... woah... woah
