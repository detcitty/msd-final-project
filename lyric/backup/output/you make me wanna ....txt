This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you,
(this is what you do)
Think about a ring and all the
things that come along with
You make me, you make me wanna
Leave the one I'm with to

Start a new relationship with you,
(this is what you do)
Think about a ring and all the
things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
when me and my girl was having problems

You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night
and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you

and how
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you,
