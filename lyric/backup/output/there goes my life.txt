All he could think about was
I'm too young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell I'm just a kid myself
How 'm I gonna raise one

All he could see were his dreams
Goin' up in smoke
So much for ditchin' this town
And hangin' out on the coast
Oh well, those plans are long gone

And he said
"There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
