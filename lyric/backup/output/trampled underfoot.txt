Greasy slicked down body, 
groovy leather trim
I like the way you hold the road, 
mama, it ain't no sin

Talkin' 'bout love 
Talkin' 'bout love 
Talkin' 'bout love 

Trouble-free transmission, 
helps your oil's flow
Mama, let me pump your gas,
 mama, let me do it all

Talkin' 'bout love 
Talkin' 'bout love 
Talkin' 'bout love 

Dig that heavy metal underneath your hood
Baby, I could work all night, 
believe I've got the perfect tools
