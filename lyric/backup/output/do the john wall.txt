We in your city where we like to do the dance
Flex to the left throw some money out your hands
Do it for the city and we do it for the fans
To ball like Wall boy you gotta' do the dance

Everybody do the John Wall
John Wall
John Wall
John Wall
John Wall
John Wall
John Wall

John Wall

Everybody clear out, hand me the rock
Time winding down 3 seconds on the shot clock
Break the defense homeboy I can't be stopped
All about my money so you know I'm hitting bank shots
I'm trying to tell them, boy you can't guard this
Beast on the court homeboy I play the hardest
Jump shot stupid, yeah it's retarded
You can't guard me in the paint I'm an artist
See I hustle on the floor call me Rick Ross
See the Troop get it jumping like a tip-off
I play hard until I hear the ref blow the whistle
I'm a player but my game be so official
Never reach got to stay out of foul trouble
But I drive in the lane, get them in foul trouble

They cant solve my game I'm a hard puzzle
But I keep three dimes that's a triple double

Raleigh be the city where we like to do the dance
