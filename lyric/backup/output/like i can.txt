He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be your preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand, but
He'll never love you like I can, can

He could be a stranger, you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand
He could have your humour, but I don't understand 'cause
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
