What Happened To That Boy
(feat. Clipse, Pharrell Williams)


[Baby (talking with echo)]
Aye, Aye, Aye, Ya
Tot' 'em up, light it up nigga
Birdman motherfucker
Clipse, VA, NO nigga
What you smelt
Coke'll leave plastic
Get off the border motherfucker
Come on little'n handle your business for me boy

[Chorus: Pusha T & (Pharrell) (2x)]
(Brrrrrrrrrrr) What happened to that boy (yo)
(Brrrrrrrrrrr) What happened to that boy
(Brrrrrrrrrrr) What happened to that boy
He was talking shit we put a clap into that boy

[Malice]
Whoa... Yeah... Malicious... Yeah
I heard they snitchin' on a player man say it aint so
Even as a young'n they consigned me to blow
Which explains why i'm worth my weight in gold
While they was taking baby steps from an 8th to an O
Word in the streets that can envy as me
