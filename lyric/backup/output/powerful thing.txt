(Al Anderson/Sharon Vaughn)

I've never seen two people in my life
More determined to ignore the obvious
We better stop thinking
Let our hearts start doing the talking.

You'd have to be stone deaf dumb and blind
Not to see what's going on with us
So let's jump in
And get over our fear of fallin'
'Cause what we got here.

Is a powerful thing
It's a powerful thing
More than three words
