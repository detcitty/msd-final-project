This is a test, sugar, sugar, boo boo
This is just a test, tell me
What do you know about love
This is just a test, it ain't your life
Tell me

I'd like to give you a test
So darling, prepare yourself
When I say 'Love', please explain
What pictures pop in your brain

'Cause when you talk about love
Say when you think about love
When you talk about love
You should be talking 'bout me

Now if you need to be taught
