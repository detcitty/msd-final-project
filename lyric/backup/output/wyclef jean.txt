This Actavis by the way I promise, on God

Okay, my money band longer than a Nascar race
I told her keep going on the gas, fuck the brakes
Only here for one night, let me put it on your face
Let a nigga nut, only way I'll go to sleep
Boolin, rockin' all the Frank Muller
I know some hoes with good head, fuck a tutor
So many hundreds I done added, I'm going to lose 'em
Put me in the Jaggy or the Wraith and now I'm coolin'
Play with my money, I'ma let them niggas do you
Play with my money I'ma let them niggas do you
Play with my money I'ma let these niggas do you
Play with my money
Play with my, play with my money

I do maye, I do
I do maye, I do
I do maye, I do
I do maye, I do

Play around with my cash
End up in a body bag
In the store and then dash
