Yo, man, man, uhh

Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothing
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothin'
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

Man, I been did that, man, I been popped off
And if she ain't trying to give it up she get dropped off
Let me bust that U-ie, bitch bust that open
Might spend a couple thou just to bust that open
Rip it off no joking,
Like your name Hulk Hogan
Niggas move weight in the South but live in Hoboken
Bitch, I spit that crack, like I'm in that trap
So if you need a hit then I'm with that bat

Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothing
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothin'
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
