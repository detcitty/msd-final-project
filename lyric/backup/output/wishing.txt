Haha, back at it
Baby, I'mma make a wish and I want you to make one
Nah, don't tell me yet, we can talk 'bout that later
DJ Drama

I ain't like them other niggas, you see that I'm different
I creep on the late night, I stay on a mission
Got all types of different bitches
Pussy wet and dripping, I been like sipping
I eat the pussy with precision
6 rings, Jordan, Pippen
I do gymnastics with a brick and flip it
Money to the ceiling, no I ain't tripping
No conversation
These niggas bitches be texting and sending emojis
But no I don't say shit
He try to hang with the homies but tell on the gang
Boy you a straight bitch
And now your girl coming over give me that booty
Know it's amazing
Loving these bitches, got into trouble with bitches
Can't fuck with these bitches

Baby you know who I am and girl I know just who you are
We ain't gotta rush into shit cause being in love is too hard
