760 parnard Crispy Cream on the tire
smoke that fire
purple cush by the pound
ask my dog Webbie
this is how it goes down
from my hood to yo hood
man we making money
in the club we poppin bottles
the room we hitting models
rollin throught the bottem
all the kids holla 'Boosie'
this life a nigga livin
like im staring in a movie
fresh out the jacozzi
a little powder on my chest
got thirty on my neck
turkey mell just cut the check
now im zoomin in my Charger
on them 24's
got a thing about BigHead and Pimp
so slow ya roll
ice cold from my neck to my wrist
we gettin paid
on my feet I got them J's
play with me I got them things
red Gucci shades
me and Joc gettin paid
now the whole United states
takin pictures all day

{Hook}

Fresh pair of J's
I hit the club stunnin

With a Fresh pair of shades
Makin that money

EveryBody gettin paid
And everything lovely
