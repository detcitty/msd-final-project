I have these moments
All steady and strong
I'm feeling so holy and humble

The next thing I know
I'm all worried and weak
And I feel myself
Starting to crumble

The meanings get lost
And the teachings get tossed
And you don't know what
You're gonna do next

You wait for the sun
But it never quite comes
Some kind of message
Comes through to you
Some kind of message
Comes through
