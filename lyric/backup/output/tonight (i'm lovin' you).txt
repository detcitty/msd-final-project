I know you want me
I made it obvious that I want you too
So put it on me
Let's remove the space between me and you

Now rock your body, oh
Damn, I like the way that you move
So give it to me
'Cause I already know what you wanna do

Here's the situation, been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation, given my reputation
Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude

But tonight I'm loveing' you
Oh, you know
That tonight I'm loving you
Oh, you know

That tonight I'm loving' you
