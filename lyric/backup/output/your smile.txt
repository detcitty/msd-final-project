Smile
Ooh... ooh...
Smile
Smile

When in your eyes shine pictures of
A time for us, i melt with love
When your lips kiss, silent words
Move the earth and shake my world

But nothin' means as much (your smile)
Nothin' seems to touch (your smile)
Your smile (your smile)
Oh, if anything i miss (your smile)
Never could resist (your smile)
Your smile, oh... oh... oh...

In your touch there's tenderness
