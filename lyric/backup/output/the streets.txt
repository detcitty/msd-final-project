Yea . .
Turn the music up a little bit . . .Dah-dah-daaah
Uh, yea Lah-dah-daaah
A little bit louder . . right there Dah-dah-daaah

In the name of the streets

Click click bu ya! Dub kicked the frame in (uh huh)
Nigga let the games begin, as I standin'

Tossed the tall can on a campus off the limital
scanners takin' penitentiary chances
Sick wit it, off the ric wit it
Blue beenie knitted; freshly acquitted
Grind-grimey, the thick body and the big body
Wit lyrics and 'draulics hotter than the Majave
Sellin', brubble bellin', career felon
Escalade 3-braid beard wearin'
Fuck it, I thug for free and thug to eat
Niggas call me 'Home of Cake' cause I love the cheese
Gangstas, hustlas, pimps, if ya follow me
Let me see ya put them hands up like a robbery
I solemnly swear to stay down and slang the seed
I spit in the name of the streets
