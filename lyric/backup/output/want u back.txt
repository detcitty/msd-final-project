Uh!
Mmm, yeah.
La la la la laaa

Uh!
Hey, boy you never had much game
So I needed to upgrade
So I went and walked away way way
Uh
Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town

Looking like a pair of clowns clowns clowns
Uh
Remember all the things that you and I did first?
And now you're doing them with her

Remember all the things that you and I did first?
You got me, got me like this
Uh

And now you're taking her to every restaurant
And everywhere we went, come on!
And now you're taking her to every restaurant
You got me, got me like this

Uh
Boy you can say anything you wanna

I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya

I want you back
I want you back
Wa-want you, want you back
Uh
