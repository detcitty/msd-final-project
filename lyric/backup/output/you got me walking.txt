Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby

My heart's been broken so many times
That's where I begun to draw the line
But your cookin' is good, your kissin' is fine
And your lovin', baby, is right on time

Ain't no man so bad
That he cannot be bad

You got me walking, yeah (You got me walking)
Facing the floor
You got me knocking (Knock-knock-knock-knock)
