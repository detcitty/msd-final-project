You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up and dust yourself off
And back in the saddle

You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious, we are getting closer
This isn't over

The pressure's on, you feel it
But you got it all, believe it

When you fall, get up, oh oh
And if you fall, get up, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
'Cause this is Africa

Tsamina mina, eh eh
Waka waka, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Listen to your God, this is our motto
