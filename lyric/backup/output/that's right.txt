(feat. Raheem the Dream)

Oh, DJ Taz

[Chorus: Neka, DJ Taz]

That's right (That's right)
That's ri-i-ight
Party people on the floor (Uh, come on)
All we do, is give them more
That's right (That's right)
That's ri-i-ight
Party people on the floor (Uh, come on)
All we do is give them more
That's right (That's right)
That's ri-i-ight

[Verse 1: DJ Taz]

Make hits is all I do
Well, how bout you?
Lay it down for the decision
Silk dresses is all I vision
Got to make that money, honey
It ain't funny country
Lights on for you
Diane Lench is my lawyer
Business trick, damn strict
DJ Taz, don't quit
No stoppin' (Stoppin', stoppin')
Stop knockin' (Knockin, knockin')
You mad, boy
Our hoes keep on jockin'
Snappin' hard like a turtle
Out of line, me want Myrtle
Nasty dancers on your station
Uh-huh we be bassin'
Keep it crunk, keep it crunk
