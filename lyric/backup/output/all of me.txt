What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out?
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down

What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy, and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
