Well, I went to bed in Memphis
And I woke up in Hollywood
I got a quarter in my pocket
And I'd call you if I could
But I don't know why, I gotta fly

I wanna rock and roll this party
I still wanna have some fun
I wanna leave you feeling breathless
Show you how the west was won
But I gotta fly, I gotta fly

Like Steve McQueen
All I need's a fast machine
I'm gonna make it all right
