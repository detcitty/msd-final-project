(When love is new, love is new)
(When love is new, love is new)

Every day is a new sensation
You thrill with infatuation

Oh, ho, ho
When love is born
It's so warm, so soft
And, oh, so tender
Everybody's willing to surrender

(When love is new, love is new)
(When love is new, love is new)

Don't let our love grow cold
