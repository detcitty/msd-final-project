Sometimes, lonely nights turn into sunny days
I never thought I'd feel this way
I never knew that you and I were meant to be in love
Oh, darling, you've always been around to see me through
How was I to know you'd make my dreams come true?
Time and time again before
Always on our own but now we're friends in love
