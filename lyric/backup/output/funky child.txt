The year is 1971
Now comes the first of the children of Roton
Lords of the underground witness the birth of the funky child
Do it all hit 'em

Born with the fuckers from the womb of Brenda
She now likes the Lords but she used to dig The Spinners
First with the style from the birth canal
And now I got the flav to make the crowd go wild

So dig it, don't watch me kick it
I'm taking no shorts unless this girl from my midget
I packs the piece more than chicken packed grease
I'm nearly knocking boots, but if not I'll knock teeth
Wahh! Gaga, ooh cries the baby

Smacked on the ass now the Doitall's crazy
No rattles or playpens, the crowds what I'm rapping
And yes I do Reruns, as if this boy was happening
Now January fourteenth has birthed the funk one
The D-Day for Dupree and yes I'm funky
I got you bobbing to the funky style
