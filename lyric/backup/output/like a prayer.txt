Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name

And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power

Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice

Feels like flying

I close my eyes
Oh God I think I'm falling
