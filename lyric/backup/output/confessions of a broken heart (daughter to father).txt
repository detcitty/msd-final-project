I wait for the postman to bring me a letter.
I wait for the good Lord to make me feel better.
And I carry the weight of the world on my shoulders
A family in crisis that only grows older.

Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?

Daughter to father daughter to father
I am broken but I am hoping.
Daughter to father, daughter to father
