Just seventeen
Everything that you've seen
It's all there in her eyes
So many years of her poor mama's tears and
Her Daddy's sweet lies
There's nobody home
Mary-Anne's alone
Almost fully grown
And worrying the why's

Jimmy's been down
He's been out and around and
He knows where it's at
Love to be good if he thought that he could
But it isn't like that
He don't make mistakes
