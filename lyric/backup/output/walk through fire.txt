I used to see those red tail lights, heading for another town
And wish that I was on my way
Looking back on these summer nights, wasting time, fooling 'round
And there was nothing here to make me stay

But that night I met you, the night you came through made me realise
There's no way I can leave, you made me believe
And now when I look in your eyes
