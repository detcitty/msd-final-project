I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

Money in the air as mo' fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, ho sale
Don't tell, wont tell, baby say "I don't talk, Dogg unless you told on me" - oh well
Take a picture wit me, what the flick gon' do
Baby stick to me and I'ma stick on you
If you pick me then I'ma pick on you
d-o-double g and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and your's is right
Rip ridin' the poles and them doors is tight
And I'ma get me a shot â€˜fo the end of the night
Cause pussy is pussy and baby you're pussy for life

I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
