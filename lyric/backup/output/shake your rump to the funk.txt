Don't stop dancing to the music
Just let the music make you high
We've got rhythm, you can use it
Don't let this feeling pass you by, by, by

Don't fight the feeling in your soul
Just boogie on back and
Let the good times roll, yeah
We're here to move your soul

Just get on up, yeah
Everybody party, come on
Y'all, let's get started, yeah, yeah
