I remember years ago, Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did, I did
And you were strong and I was not, My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

And now when all is done there is nothing to say, You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them, Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops, Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now, Tell them I was happy
