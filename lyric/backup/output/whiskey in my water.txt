In my truck, flyin' down a dirt road
Pickin' you up, feelin kinda crazy
I think I'm in luck cause I know my baby

She slaps my knee, says boy why you smilen?
Doin' my best, so hard to hide it
I know what's up, so I just shoot her a wink

(Chrous)
Cause when the sun goes down it'll getta little hotter
Make an ole boys heart beat a little harder
I know I can't lose cause It's goin' down smooth tonight, baby
