Ah, Ah 
 No! No! No! 
 Ah, Ah 
 No! No! No! 
 Ah, Ah 
 No! No! No! 
 No! No! No! 
 Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah [fade] 
 
 I don't need your - No! No! No! 
 I don't need your - No! No! No! 
 I don't need your love no more 
 I don't need your - No! No! No! 
 I don't need your - No! No! No! 
 I don't need your love no more 
 
 Thinking 
 About the times we spent together 
 You said you'd never leave 
 But then you left me lonely 
 And now you're here, boy 
 And your time is up 
 Cuz now I'm stronger 
 And I'm standing on my own 
 So...
