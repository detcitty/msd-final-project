I never thought you'd pick up the phone
It's Friday night you should be at home at town
Didn't think you'd be sitting at home all alone like me
Nothing on TV, nothing to do
Nothing to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinking 'bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time
