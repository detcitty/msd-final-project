(I'm gonna give it 2 you)
One for da money
Two for da bass
Three to get ya goin'
'Cuz da brat's in da place
(I'm gonna give it 2 you)

It's me, da O.G.Funk Bandit
(Who's dat?)
Da B to da R A T and in fact
If you ain't heard of me
Take a seat, lay back and listen
As I bust for yo ass on dis funkdafied mission

(Just kick off your shoes and relax your feet)
That's right
(Party on down wit da brat and her beat)
Now it goes like dat and dat's how it goes
I'ma give it to all you negroes and hoes
So listen up, make sure you listen up well
And don't miss shit 'cuz this bitch be bad as hell
