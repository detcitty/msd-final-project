Lazy moon, Magnolia bloom perfume
And Dixie would receive
A lady fading fast
Still clinging to the past
But she had you hating to leave

So long, Dixie, sweet Dixie girl
You sure had style
Recalling times we've had
With all your good and bad
I'm glad I had you for awhile

When we get the blues
We just shine up our shoes
