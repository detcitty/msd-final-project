Verse 1: Dray

Well I'ma freakit like this so then my nigga Books is next
The crew is from the sewer when the crew is Das EFX
I wrecks cos when I flex I gots ta rip it
Excuse me if some brew it makes me woozy when I sip it
I'm wicked so let me kick it, I got my crew in
I rips just for kicks, I got more dicks than *? Perduin?*
I pick em, pluck em, stuck em wit my cock an'
no my name ain't Santa but here's somethin for ya stockin
I'm rockin, I got'cha Glock and I'm from the under
Down to take my sound because it's bound to make ya wonder

Chorus:

Well I'ma freakit like that, and I'ma freakit like this
Well I'ma freakit like that, and I'ma freakit like this
Well I'ma freakit like that, and I'ma freakit like this
