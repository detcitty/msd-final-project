I know what you're doing
You don't want to put the hurt on someone
You've been trying to convince yourself
You're better off if you just turn and run

But I'm gonna hold on tight
I've got a feeling
You'll only happen once to me
And no one, not even you
Is ever gonna make you wrong for me

Don't Walk Away
Or are you looking for a price to pay
Is that your master plan
Don't Walk Away
I'll do everything to make you stay
