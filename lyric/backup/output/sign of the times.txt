As I lie here thinking of you
I realize that nothing is new
Lying in my bed thinking of you
I realize nothing is new
You say you love me but want success
I say you're lying, nothing has changed
This is the sign of the times
Piece of more to come
This is the sign of the times
Time to be alone
This is the sign of the times
Piece of more to come
This is the sign of the times
Time to be alone

We're strong in bed
You're weak in love
