I took 2 weeks vacation, for the honey moon
A couple tickets all inclusive, down in cancun
I couldn't get my money back so,
I'm in seat 7A
I'm gettin' drunk on a plane

I bet the feller on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture
To the seat back right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottle fillin' both our trays
I'm gettin' drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party.
Got this seven thirty-seven rockin' like the G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
