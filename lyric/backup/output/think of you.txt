All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

I feel so strange thinking about you
After all the wrong you've done to me
I can't go on feeling like I do
'Cause my heart loves you, I'm so confused

All the time I think of you
Holding on to someone new
Don't make me lose my mind
Seems like I've been here before
