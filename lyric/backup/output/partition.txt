Let me hear you say "Hey Ms. Carter" (Hey Ms. Carter)
Say "Hey Ms. Carter" (Hey Ms. Carter)
Give me some!

See me up in the club with fifty-leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up tell me how I'm looking babe

Boy this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking babe
Just tell me how it's looking babe
(How it's looking babe)
I do this all for you baby just take aim
Tell me how it's looking babe
(How it's looking babe)
Tell me how it's looking babe, looking babe

Drop the bass mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble
Puffing on the mids
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
