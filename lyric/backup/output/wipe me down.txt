Hey!
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)
Mr. Wipe Down, here
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)
Here with Foxx-a-million
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)

(Cause Im on, wipe me down)
This one be the remix!
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)

Bad Azz
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)
Savage life
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)
Foxx-a-million
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)
Man you'll all over this, you know what is
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)

(Cause Im on, wipe me down)
We still on
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)
We still ridin on chrome
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)
We still pullin up
(Cause Im on, wipe me down)

I pull up at the club V-I-P
Gas tank on E but all drinks on me
(Wipe me down)
Fresh kicks, fresh white tall tee
Fresh NFL hat, fresh 'bauds with the crease
(Wipe me down)

Pussy niggas wanna hit me wit they heat
Real recognize real real niggaz gon speak
(Wipe me down)
Jiggalatin I been rollin bout a week
You can tell I got cake by the diamonds in my teeth
(Wipe me down)

Black shades so you know a nigga rollin
Ain't check me at the door, so ain't no tellin what Im holdin
(Wipe me down)
Bad bitches, they gon bust it wide open
Niggas flashin they lil' bread but Im the nigga they approachin
(Wipe me down)

Small niggas, tall figures, yall niggas crowd niggas
We gon' get mac elevens and dog niggas
(Wipe me down)
Yall niggas call niggas but my niggas all killas
Get ya issue and whoever fall wit ya
