What's up, baby?
It's your new boyfriend
Royce

Oh, yeah
Yo, it's got that dancehall, feel to it
Prince Royce, Mr. Worldwide, J-Lo, let's ride

Girl, your body is timeless (yeah)
Girl, your body got me like
Oh my gosh, oh my god
Oh mama

And you're making me earn it (yeah)
Girl, you're making me earn it
Oh my gosh, oh my god
Oh mama

Ain't nothing fake on you
You so, so real
Try playing cool
But can't help how I feel

I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back, back, back it up
D치melo, papi chulo
D치melo, papi chulo

You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back, back, back it up
D치melo, papi chulo
D치melo, papi chulo
