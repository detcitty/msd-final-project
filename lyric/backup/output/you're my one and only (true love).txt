When you came into my life
You showed me what true love was meant to be
You brought light into my shadows
And made me be your number one priority
And when you hold me in your arms
The rest of the world seems to disappear
I'm in heaven when I'm with you
And for the first time I can tell it's real

You're my one and only, my one and only true love-True love
