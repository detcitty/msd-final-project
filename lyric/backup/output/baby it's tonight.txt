Won't you pick up the phone
â€˜Cause I know that you're home
Too many words have not been said
For us to be living alone
Now all of the fighting
And all of the tears
Well they don't matter now
Another night falls dark and lonely
And you're the only one that I can turn to

If I ever needed your arms to hold me
Baby, it's tonight
