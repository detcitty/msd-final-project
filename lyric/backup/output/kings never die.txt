Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know somethin's coming
But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was
Was it, too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens
Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head

Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?

How 'bout that, I'm somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at

I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt

Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about

Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter

Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up

Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong

Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
Cause someone told me that
