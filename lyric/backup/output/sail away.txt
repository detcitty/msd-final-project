I don't know what your folks got against me, girl
But I do know that I want you permanently in my world
What's age or color or money when you love one another?
I know you keep saying to me 'Our love will win and then you'll see.'

But baby, sail away with me
I can't wait another day
So you and I (can be free), oh baby
