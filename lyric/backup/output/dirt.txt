You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlights dance with your boots in it
Dirt

You write your name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your cornfield, whiskey
Bonfires on it
Dirt

You bet your life on it

It's that old shade red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
