So-so-so good
Yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa

Her name is Sophelia
And she is my fly
I call her Firecracker
And that's no lie

A real poppin' lady, yeah
So soft and so pretty
And when I get around her, yeah
I can't wait to be dirty, oh, mama sita

Burnin' up, burnin' up
Can't seem to get enough of you
Get enough, get enough
Firecracker

Burnin' up, burnin' up
Can't seem to get enough of you
Get enough, get enough
Firecracker

So-so-so good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
