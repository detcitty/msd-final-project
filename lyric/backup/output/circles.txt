All my life? s a circle
Sunrise and sundown
The moon rose through the nighttime
Till the day break comes around
All my life? s a circle
But I can? t tell you why
The seasons spinning round again
The years keep rolling by

It seems like I've been here before
I can? t remember when
But I've got this funny feeling
That I'll be back once again
