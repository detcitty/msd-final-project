SLAM! duuh duuh duuh, duuh duuh duuh Let the boys be boys!
SLAM! duuh duuh duuh, duuh duuh duuh Make noise b-boys!

Well here's another one (WHAT!)
In the gutter one (WHAT!)
Ghetto runnin em
Troblesome extra double double I come to beat em
The beat em and mistreat em
So what if that I'm cheating.
Every one wanna sound grimey.
Imma show you how come on (ALL AND TOGETHER NOW!)
Yeaah, ohh yeaah!
YEAH!
That's how we gotta be
so stop trying to beat loud as me cause you can't do that
Think about playin russian roulette with an atuomatic rifle
My ass against the line blast bullets first
On Line
Toughest step and a rep and a run packin a weapon its wild
Peace to the brothers on Rycher's Isle
Pumping up a trebble and didn't like he's criminally in buck my eye,
Oh my god I'm so high
Just they say a Rodney say you like a criminum, what does it take
to make you get
Making million children SLAM! Slam!
