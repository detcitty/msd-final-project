Don't be afraid, 
To pleasure yourself.
Can't you remember, 
How good it felt?

Cravin' for love, 
Is a natural desire.
Don't fight the feelin', 
And let me take you higher.

A love don't dare 
Has made you grieve.
But this love of mine, 
Can bring relief.

Come get the cream off the top, 
Come get the best that I got, 
And I'll belong to you.
