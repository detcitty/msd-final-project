You're my baby, my lover, my lady
All night you make me want you, it drives me crazy
I feel like you were made just for me, babe
Tell me if you feel the same way

'Cause it just feels so right, I don't wanna waste no time
If I had to choose, I know I'm gon' always choose

To be with you, 'cause girl, don't you know
Girl, don't you know, you're so beautiful?
I wanna give all my love to you, girl
Not just a night but the rest of your life
