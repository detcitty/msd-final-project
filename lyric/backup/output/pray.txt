That's word, we pray(pray, pray)
We got to pray
Just to make it today
I said we pray(pray) ah, yeah, pray(pray)
We got to pray
Just to make it to pray
That's word, we pray

All my life I wanted to make it to the top
(That's word, we pray)
Some said I wouldn't
They told me no, but I didn't stop
(That's word, we pray)
Working hard, making those movies everyday
(That's word, we pray)
And on my knees every night, you know I pray

That's word, we pray(pray)
Ah, yeah, pray(pray) we got to pray
Just to make it today
I said we pray(pray) ah, yeah, pray(pray)
We got to pray
Just to make it today
That's word, we pray

Now I just think that you
Can do what ever you want
(That's word, we pray)
I'm bustin' these rhymes
Making this money and I won't
(That's word, we pray)
Forget my people or may town or my ways
(That's word, we pray)
And on my knees.every night I'm still gonna pray

That's word, we pray(pray)
Ah, yeah, pray(pray) we got to pray
Just to make it today
