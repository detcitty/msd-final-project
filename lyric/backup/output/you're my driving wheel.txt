You're my driving wheel
Feels good, baby
You take me farther, ooh
Than I've been before
Ride, ride, ride, ride
You're my driving wheel
Feels so good, baby
Just one touch, ow, ooh
Opens up my door
You're the engine that keeps me running
You're the motor that keeps me coming
To the road that keeps on winding
Coming to the love, I keep on finding
Every time you touch me
Starts my motor running
I like the way you keep it humming
Keeps my motor running
I like the way you keep it humming
Hey, you're my driving wheel
You better believe it, baby
You take me farther, whoo
Than I've been before
Than I've been before, yeah
You're my driving wheel
My driving wheel, baby
Just one touch, ow
Opens up my door
Opens up my door
