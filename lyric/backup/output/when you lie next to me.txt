Maybe, tonight, we could close the door and lock ourselves inside
Take time to feel
I don't want to miss the chance to be so real
The days all fly away
And I forget the truth
Everything that matters is in this room

When you lie next to me
Breathin' the air I breathe
We don't have to speak
And just be
