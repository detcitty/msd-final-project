[PRE-HOOK]
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm really, really
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
[1st VERSE]
Let me holla' at the d.j.
Come on d.j. put that record on the replay
Don't you see how them bitches move they bootay
Everytime you play this record, smell like coochie
Follow d'em, Screamin' like a groupay
Misdemeanor move my nookie like a hoochay
For them hatas fuck whatever you say
Because you know I'm too cool for you anyway
I'm just a bad bitch
M-I-S, Miss
I'm gonna' keep talkin' shit till you get this
I'm gonna' bust up in the club wit' no guest list
Them otha' artist, I keep 'em all restless
I don't french kiss unless it's 50 cent
Vivica, we can share him like the president
