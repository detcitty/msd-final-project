Take the short way home

You? ve been makin? up your mind
And I can save you from the trouble that your heart is goin? through
And I can tell you what your future? s gonna be
Maybe we can open up your eyes
Baby, you can? t leave me now

There is lightenin' in the city
Stranger than you ever saw
Get back to your special lover
And I won? t ever turn on you
Or tell you you should tell me where you go

And take the short way home
Baby, take care of your health
In this world of evil
I can? t keep you to myself

Take the short way home
You? ll be safe here by my side
