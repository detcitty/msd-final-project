Hey, let's get away and get a room
On other side of town
Hey shawty, I was thinkin' of you
(Ay, was you thinkin' of me, ay ay)

Hey, let's get a room
Shawty we can freak somethin' if you down
(Whachu would do?)
Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you

Bet they be like "I know he tired of the nightlife
He want a wife, he just lookin' for the right type"
Yea right, I be ridin' through the city lights
My hat bent, gettin' high behind the 'lac tint

I'm chilllin' with Brazilian women, heavy accents
They black friends translatin', got'em all ass naked, adjacent
Have relations wit' em many places
Leavin' semen in they British faces
Make 'em kiss they partners with it in they faces

Young pimpin' sprung women 'cross the 50 states
Got young ladies requestin' "What's Yo Name" on 50 stations
Askin' me what's a pussy popper, want a demonstration
But I ain't waitin' til the second date, I'm so impatient

Relieve 'em of they aggravation, take 'em rollerskatin'
On them Dayton's, tell'em "Baby, stick with me, you goin' places"
Go replace 'em, draw erase 'em out my memory
Moist panties and wet sheets when they think of me

Hey, let's get away and a room
On the other side of town
Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you
