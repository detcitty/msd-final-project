Hey, hey, ah
Let's go, let's go , let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go , let's go, let's go
Hey, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Ever since I was a kid, I was dreamin' bout this
First day of practice, I was thinkin' bout this
Picture on the news, Yeah they see about this
Even in the paper, they goin' read about this
Cause all of my life, Training day in and night
I'm preparin' to fight, for everyone that believed in
Crowds going insane, yeah they screamin' my name
While we sprayin champagne
