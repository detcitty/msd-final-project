Roc ya body mic check 1, 2
'Cuz it ain't a party till the crew run through
Shake ya body, show me whatchu can do like oh, oh
Roc ya body, mic check 1, 2
DJ spin the needle, roc into the groove
Bump it louder so the crowd wanna move like oh, oh
Yo, I blaze the illest, so much skill
It's impossible for you not to feel us
The realest, MC that you ever met in your life
I'm tryna see you work, put a little sweat in your life
I got an idea and it might sound silly
But I wanna roll your body in a tight brown Philly
Crack it, lick it up, seal it, air tight, get a light
Because you know we gonna burn it all night
And I just might double the ice on dental
And if you double the price, me and Vice roc in, c'mon
Roc ya body mic check 1, 2
'Cuz it ain't a party till the crew run through
Shake ya body, show me whatchu can do like oh, oh
Roc ya body, mic check 1, 2
