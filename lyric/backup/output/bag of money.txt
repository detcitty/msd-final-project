My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

She got me caught up in the moment
She got me caught up in the moment
I only kiss her when she on it
Treat her good, make her call me in the morning

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

My chick bad, looking like a bag of money
That chick bad, looking like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I treat her good and she always ride it for me

Temporary forever, levitate with a n****
