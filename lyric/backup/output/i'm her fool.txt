She tells me all the time
That she loves me
She even poured the wine
Of the same

She taught me like
My first grade teacher
To love and I love the same

And I love to go to school
And I like to shoot pool
And I can't play your fool
'Cause I'm her fool

I run like a dog
When she calls me
'Cause she pets me
When I bury my bone
