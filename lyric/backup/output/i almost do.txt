I bet, this time of night you're still up
I bet, you're tired from a long, hard week
I bet, you're sitting in your chair by the window, looking out at the city
And I bet, sometimes you wonder about me

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Everytime I don't
