She's got the kind of look that defies gravity
She's the greatest cook
And she's fat-free

She's been to private school
And she speaks perfect French
She's got the perfect friends
Oh, isn't she cool?

She practices Tai Chi
She'd never lose her nerve
She's more than you deserve
She's just far better than me

Hey, hey!

So don't bother
I won't die of deception
