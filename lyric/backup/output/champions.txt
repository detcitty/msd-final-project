Quavo!
Lifestyle on camera
Hundred thousand dollar chandelier
They tried to turn me to an animal
But white people think I'm radical
Supermodels think I'm handsome
You might think I'm too aggressive
But really I think I'm too passive
'Till I pull out the chopper, start blasting

1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go

Pray for me
I'm about to hit the Ye button
I don't wanna say nothin' wrong
But it'd be wrong if I ain't say nothin'
Imagine if I ain't say somethin'
Wouldn't none these niggas say nothin'
I done lost and made money
Now I'm makin' somethin' they can't take from me
Now I'm fresh out of debt in this mothafucka!
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka!
Yeezy might have to go and put his Louis on
I'm 'bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store

Fresh out the feds in this mothafucka
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka
Gucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on
Now that Gucci's home, it's over for you Gucci clones

1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round they go
Round and round they go

Look, I say a prayer for my enemies
They cannot slow down what's meant for me
Funny how they come around like I can't see through their secret identities
Lately it's all about Zen and me
Subtractin' the negative energy
With the family, turn your ass to a memory
