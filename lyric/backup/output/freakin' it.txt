Uh, uh
I'm bout to freak this
Ha, ha, ha, ha
What? What? What? What?
Uh, Big Will, uh I'm bout to freak this
What you want me to freak this
Just peep it while I freak this,
Aight, aight

I'm bout to freak this full out the king of the hill
Big Will keepin' it real knees in da grill
The whole set all locked down, making you flock down,
Where I'm at they here my rap,
I be that cat to set trends
Where y'all at
On the corner with your friends
Heard you screamin about cream in your rap kid
Yo my last check for Wild Wild West came on a flat bed
Once and for all lets get this straight
How you measure a rapper what make an MC great
Is it the sales? 20 mill
Is it the cars? Bentley's
Is it the women? Jada
Is it the money? Please
Mr. Clean yet the fact remain
Got girls that don't speak English screamin' my name
All you rappers yellin' bout who you put in a hearse
Do me a favor write one verse without a curse

I'm bout to freak this (yeah, yeah)
What you want me to freak this? (yeah, yeah)
Don't sleep I'mma freak this (yeah, yeah)
