I tell you, I'm all right now
But last week I was in rough shape
I don't get a break with nothing

I played hide and seek when I was three
(No respect, no respect)
Why, they wouldn't even look for me
(No respect, no respect)

I was an ugly kid, I never had fun
(No respect, no respect)
They took me to a dog show and I won
(No respect, no respect)

When I was born, I brought no joy
(No respect, no respect)
My old man said he wanted a boy
(No respect, no respect)

I was an ugly kid, always alone
(No respect, no respect)
Halloween, I had to
Trick or treat over the phone
(No respect, no respect)

Friends don't call
My phone don't ring
I don't get a break with anything
(What's the matter, Rodney)
Ah, death, where is thy sting

(CHORUS):
It's just rapping Rodney
Ain't that your type, no, no
Rapping Rodney, get out of sight
It's just rapping Rodney
Make no mistake
Poor old rapping Rodney
Can't get a break

I'm getting old, it's hard to face
