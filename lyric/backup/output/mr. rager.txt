I'm off on a adventure
(We're good, this here is dedicated to all of the kids like me)
I'm on my way to heaven
(Wherever you are now, we're good)

Birds sing flying around
You never see them too long on the ground
You wanna be one of them, yeah
You wanna be one of them, yeah

You might hear the birds singing flying around
You never see them too long on the ground
You wanna be one of them, yeah
You wanna be one of them, yeah

Whoa now, hey, Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager
