Yeah, yeah, ohhhhhh
Close your eyes and I'll love you
I will make a smile down inside you

I'm so into you I don't know what I'm gonna do
Because I care for you
Care for you


Oh, don't chide girl you've got me
Even if it's wrong or right the world can't stop me

I'm so into I don't know what I'm gonna do
Because I care for you
Care for you

Love will heal heart broken yesterday, yeah
