(Whitney:) Many nights we prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song we barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know theres much to fear

We were moving mountains long before we knew we could
Whoa, yes
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill

Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
(Mariah:) whoa...
