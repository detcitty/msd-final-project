The summer that we wanted
Yeah, we've finally got it
Now's the time we get to share
Each day we'll be together
Now until forever
So everybody, everywhere
Let's take it to the beach
Take it there together
Let's celebrate today
Cause there'll never be another
We're stronger this time
We've been there for each other
Everything's just right
Everybody, all for one
Our real summer has just begun
Let's rock and roll and just let go
Feel the rhythm of the drums
We're gonna have fun in the sun
Now that all the hard work, work is done
Everybody, one for all
And all for one (All for one)
All for one, one
Summertime together
