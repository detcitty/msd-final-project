The world "talkin" ´bout the world belongs to you
It belongs to yo
The world
I know I know I know
Belongs to me
It belongs to me
I´m ready for the eighty´s glad to be alive
I´m waiting for those magic numbers to arrive
I´ve got myself together got myself in gear
I´m gonna be the first out there, to greet those
Fabulous year

I´m ready for the eighty´s, I´m ready for the eighty´s
Ready for the time of my life
Are you ready
Are you ready
'Cause I´m ready for you, honey
'Cause I´m ready for you
I´m ready for the eighty´s, I´m ready for the eighty´s
Ready for the time of my life

Are you ready for me
