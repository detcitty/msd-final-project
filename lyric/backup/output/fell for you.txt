Like a star, slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky, tumbling through space
When you touch my hand,
I swear I feel... like I'm falling
(falling, falling, falling)
Seems like I'm falling...
(falling, falling, falling)

Like a wheel whirling, round and round,
Rolling down a hill (rolling-down-a-hill),
Spining on the ground
Your kisses make my dizzy (yeah)
In the head... and I'm falling,
(falling, falling, falling)
Falling...
