Early morning when I leave your side
Start my car and drive
Before the new day? s dawning
You know I? ll return
Apart we won? t survive

If love doesn? t mean enough (really mean enough)
Somebody invents another word

Oh, oh, oh, in the nature of love
I never can say goodbye
Oh, oh, oh, in the nature of love
I never can say goodbye
