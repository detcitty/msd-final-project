Strange love
Strange highs and strange lows
Strange love
That's how my love goes
Strange love

Will you give it to me?
Will you take the pain
I will give to you?
Again and again
And will you return it?

There'll be times
When my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think I've had enough

From your sea of love
I'll take more than another river full
Yes, and I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile
