Hey... do it now
Yeah hey

Hey once I was a boogie singer playin' in a rock and roll band
I never had no problems yeah burnin' down one night stands
And everything around me yeah
Got to stop to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly yes I did
To disco down and check out the show
Yeah they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy

Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Hee-hee
Till you die (yeah)

Yeah-yeah
Well I tried to understand this (yeah) hey
I thought that they were out of their minds huh
How could I be so foolish?
How could I?
