You know what time it is nigga,
and you know who the fuck this is. DANGER!
DANGER! Get on the floor! The nigga right chea! Sing it!

Been so long (sing it!)
Since, he's been on
So please (get on the floor!)
Show me (the nigga right chea!)
What it is that you want to see

Go tell the DJ to put my shit on
I'm keepin' you niggas and bitches in jump from the minute I get on
Taking they shit off, showing they tattoos,
screamin, and hollerin' and all
Got the gift to come up with it,
put it together, deliver it, make them feel it, bitch I been on!
Sharp! Like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad! Like that student in the principal's office
Put rappers in coffins
They dive like dolphins
I'm the lyrical marvel officer
Watch yourself!
Or fuck around and get beside yourself
I know! Go ahead though
