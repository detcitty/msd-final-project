Well it was Friday in the P.M. and just like every weekend, 
I was ready to throw down.
Yeah I get a little tore up, 
so I call my bros up to meet me out on town.
Well Wild Man Willie said "I'd like to really" but Idol was on TV. 
And Ray had a date with his wife 
and they quit drinking but he didn't tell me.

Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer, 
kick it 'til the morning light?
If I have to raise hell all by myself
