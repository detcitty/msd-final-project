*Guy Talking*
Get on, get on nigga though
1991 and I heard somebody dropped then dropped the bomb
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD
Ayo, I don't think they understand yet
Brains, drop a little oochie coochie on them

(Chorus: repeat 4x)
Oochie coochie la la la
Oochie coochie

Ayo Brains, kick the first verse

(Verse 1)
Oochie coochie la la la
I am the Brains and I'm up to par
Quit actin brand new, I know ya fruity
Cause when ya walkin, ya shakin that booty
All the guys sayin your hard to get
You just don't know you haven't met the Brains yet
At the beginning yes my game is kickin
But at the end, it's the moves I'm stickin
Why don't you come come gimme that booty
So you can spend the whole night wit MC-be
I will caress you and rub you like a poochie
You gotta promise to gimme the oochie coochie
Come on and gimme that pretty body
Any kind of position you have to soothe me
