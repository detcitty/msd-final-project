Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine

Sweet sugar candyman

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really got me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm
He's a one stop shop, makes my panties drop
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candyman, ooh, yeah

He took me to the Spider Club on Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shut the paparazzi for a big surprise
