Well baby, baby, don't you leave me here to make it alone
'Cause I don't think that I could take it for a day on my own
Why would you wanna hurt me
When I love you, baby, can't ya see
That you're precious to me?

(I love you so) and I can't let you go (can't let you go)
Maybe one day you'll see (girl can't you see)
That you'll always be (you'll always be)
