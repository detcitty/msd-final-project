I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than loving a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic.

I wish it wasn't 4 AM standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
