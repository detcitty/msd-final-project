I've got something to tell you
That I think you ought to know
That my eyes are on you baby
Since a long time ago

And now I finally got the nerve
And I'm gonna make my move
Now don't you try to turn me off
'Cause it's gonna be hard to do

I've got a thing about you baby
Ain't nothing I can do
I've got a thing about you baby
A thing about lovin' you
