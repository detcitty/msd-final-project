Hendrix ah, ah
I woke up like this

Reporting live from the fucking gutter bitch
I ain't talking about some real money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talking nothin' but big money bitch

Reporting live from the gutter
I'll buy these motherfuckers talking big money shit bitch
Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talking 10 mill just to get an asset
I know them tears did on my last bitch
The money made me hungry I'm a savage
I've seen stars lining up you can't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic count it up and started laughing, ha
