This is all God's doing man you can't plan it
But if the devils in the details then I'm satanic
Take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinking like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer man you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitching underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really when she get to talking I don't understand it
You ain't on it right away, you had to wait on it nigga
Man I'm only 29 have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
Face time with my shawty on tour
And she texting purple hearts cause she know we at war

Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Put me in all fucked up position
You gon make me call my bros, for assistance
