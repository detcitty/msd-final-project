What's the matter with your life?
Is the poverty bringin' you down?
Is the mailman jerkin' you 'round?
Did he put your million dollar check in someone else's box?

Tell me, what's the matter with your world?
Was it a boy when you wanted a girl?
(Was it a boy when you wanted a girl?)
Don't you know straight hair ain't got no curl (no curl)
Life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space to fill
Pop life
