Mama told me not to waste my life
She said spread your wings, my little butterfly
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And if they give you shh
Then they can walk on by
My feet, feet can't touch the ground
And I can't hear a sound
But you just keep on running up your mouth, yeah
Walk, walk on over there

'Cause I'm too fly to care, oh yeah

Your words don't mean a thing
I'm not listening
Keep talking, all I know is

Mama told me not to waste my life
She said spread your wings, my little butterfly
Don't let what they say keep you up at night
And they can't detain you
