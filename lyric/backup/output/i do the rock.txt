Edith Sitwell giving readings
14 Moscow Road
Osbert's giving champagne parties
Sachie's got a cold
Gertrude's hanging pictures
Alice making tea
Me, I do the only thing that still
Makes sense to me
I do the Rock
I do the Rock Rock

John and Yoko farming beef
Raising protein quota
Sometimes they make love and art
Inside their Dakota
Rodney's feeling sexy
Mick is really frightfully bold
Me, I do the only thing
That stops me growing old
I do the Rock
I do the Rock Rock
I do the Rock Rock Rock

Well, it's stimulating

Solzhenitzin feels exposed
Build a barbed-wired prison
Nietzsche's six feet under
