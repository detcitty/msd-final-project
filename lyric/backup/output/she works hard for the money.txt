She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money.
So you better treat her right.

She works hard for the money.
So hard for it, honey.
She works hard for the money.
So you better treat her right.

Onetta there in the corner stands
And she wonders where she is.
And the rain still hurts,
Some people seem to have everything.
Nine a.m. on the hour hand
And she's waiting for the bell.
And she's looking real pretty.
She's waiting for her clientele.

She works hard for the money.
