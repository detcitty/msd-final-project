I know I could lie, but I'm telling the truth
Wherever I go, there's a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

Some people lie, but they're looking for magic
Others are quietly going insane
I feel alive when I'm close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
