There's two things I know for sure
She was sent here from Heaven and she's Daddy's little girl
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes
And I thank God for all of the joy in my life
Oh but most of all
For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
Walk beside the pony, Daddy, it's my first ride
I know the cake looks funny, Daddy, but I sure tried
