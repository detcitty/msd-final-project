She was a-seaside sittin'
Just a-smokin' and a-drinkin' on ringside
On top of the world, oh yeah
She had her drink in her hand
She had her toes in the sand and whoa! Ha, ha
What a beautiful girl, ah yeah

What a sweet talkin' honey with a little bit o' money
She turn your head around
Creature from the sea with the looks to me
Like she like to fool around

What a snappy little mammy gonna keep a pappy happy
And accompany me, to the ends of the earth, ah yeah
Ah, that's why I said

Here I am, ain't no man of the world, no
All I need is a beautiful girl
