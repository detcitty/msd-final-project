I had a couple beers with one of my friends, told him just how our story ends.
I did all I could to try to make it work, but you drove my heart through the Alabama dirt.
I've been at your house, climbing them walls, checking that calendar, x-ing days off, hit another bar, call another friend, throw a few down tell the story again.
Hey hey what can I say, I just lie and say it's all okay.
