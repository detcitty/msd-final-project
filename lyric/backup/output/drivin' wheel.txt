Feelin' good, can't be real
Must be dreamin' 'bout my drivin' wheel
Rollin' on, drivin' on
Come to me and rock me all night long

We've got a roll goin', too good to stop
Flyin' high, we've got too far to drop
Everybody needs somebody to love
I've got you and that's love enough

You're my drivin' wheel
You're my drivin' wheel
