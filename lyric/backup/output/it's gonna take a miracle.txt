Loving you so
I was to blind to see
You letting me go
But now that you've set me free

It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
'Cause I'm crazy for you

Oh, didn't you know
It wouldn't be so easy
You letting me go
You can be sure that now

It's gonna take a miracle
Yes, it's gonna take a miracle
To make me love someone new
