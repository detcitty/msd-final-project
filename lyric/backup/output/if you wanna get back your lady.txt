If you wanna get back your lady
Your lady needs to know, oh yeah
Oh, if you really love her
You know you got to tell her so, yes, you do

If you wanna get back your lady
Communicate for real, hey baby
Or ain't no way your lady's gonna find out
How you really feel, ooh

I was a young shy girl
I thought I found my world in you the day we met
You were so cool and wise
One look into your eyes and my heart started gettin' upset
