We say goodbye, see you around
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up, we make up and we make love
We can't seem to let go girl so

I'm comin' over, running every red light
To hell with the closure, save it for another time
Try not to think about you but it ain't working
Why put out a fire when it's still burning
Just when I think moving On's getting closer
