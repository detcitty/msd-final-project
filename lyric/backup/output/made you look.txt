Bravehearts

Uh, uh, uh, now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step wit'
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas-Yo
Grey goose and a whole lotta hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well dressed with finesse
In a white tee lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness here's the Anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot wit'
Push the pool stick in your new crib, same hand that you hoop with
Swing around like you stupid, king o'the town, yeah I been that
You know I click-clack where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back
