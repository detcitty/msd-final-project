When I look back on everything I've done
I know you must have cried a river of tears
But you were there when I was feeling low
To walk me through my darkest fears

So when the sun goes down
And those nights grow colder
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder

And the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion
And the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion
