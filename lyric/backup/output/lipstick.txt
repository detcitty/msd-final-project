(ChapmanChinn)
You broke my heart when you came home with someone else's lipstick on
You shut the door and climb the stair, your attitude is you could care about me
When you pull the covers back and climb into the sack, bet you could do without me
It's me the fool who's always there, and you the fool who never cares
And then I hit it
And I nail my mouth to the evil taste of lipstick
Inhale the scent of someone else's lipstick
Someone else's lipstick
Someone else's lipstick
