It's the right kind of love
It's the right kind of night
You're the right kind of girl
Ooh
Oh, yeah
Hey, hey, ooh
It's the right kind of love
Kind of love

Daydreamin' about you baby
And it must be love
Girl you make my heart go crazy
High as the Heaven's above, oh yeah

I hope you're thinkin' about me girl
Because all of my thoughts are with you
My love
There's no reason to doubt me
Believe me it's true
Girl, I know that I can give you

The right kind of love
It's the right kind of night
You're the right kind of girl
And we're right on time
