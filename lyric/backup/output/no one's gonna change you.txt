From the day we met
I knew you were the one
who stole my heart and ran with love
Now here you are
making me cry inside
no longer will I be a prisoner of your love


You, listen to me
I'm speakng my mind
I'm not gonna let you keep waiting my time
As hard as it is
As much as I'll cry
I want you to know
That I'm saying goodbye
How long did you think we could go on?
While your treating me wrong and kept feeding me lies
I'm letting you know, so don't be surprised
When I let you go and start living my life
