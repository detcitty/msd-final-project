To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (mmm)

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time? And
It's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talking 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me, you must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
