Oh, c'mon
Oh, c'mon

I'm a menace to society baby
The police wanna relocate me
They running with gun up but they can't fade me
They wanted to come up but they ain't crazy

I ride one in the chamber, with gun on cock
Six train Chevrolet rollin' without no top
Got them hydraulics that's dumping, making it drop
California to Virginia, Timmy making it hot

Taking long rides in the G4 plane
X-Man to the stage, got 'em going insane
Yeah, got the world saying my name
I'm bout to make a little change, I'ma keep it the same, dig

X to the Z baby, run up on your hitting corners
Phantom platinum grill, c'mon
X be the life of the party
Don't be scared girl, reach out and touch somebody

Can you feel the speakers jumping?
Other guys surrounding but they don't say nuthin'
Muggin' in the club like they wanna do something
Feeling kinda rowdy huh? Hey now, hey now

All the girls mean muggin'
'Cause it musta seem what the girl pulled up in
In the club like they wanna do something
Feeling kinda rowdy huh? Hey now, hey now
