When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feeling
Then there ain't no room for you, this part of town
'Cause we're the party people, night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

So tonight
Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
An' just enjoy yourself
Groove
Let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall

Life ain't so bad at all
Live your life off the wall
You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin an' folks all gettin' loud
