Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put your body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything goes right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess
It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone

What you needs a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day
When your worlds falling apart
All you have to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's an answer in your heart
So let your light shine on my dear
And love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
Love will save the day
