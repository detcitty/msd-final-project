Woo

If you don't know how I feel for you
It's time I let all feelings show
I love you and I'll never
Let you go, no, baby

Right now we're just friends
But baby I pray some you'll surrender to love so tender
I won't push you
As long as you know that my love is true

Get closer to you, baby, hey
Closer than just friends
I want to get closer to you, baby, hey
Closer than just friends

How about you?
