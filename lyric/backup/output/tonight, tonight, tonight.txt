I'm coming down, coming down like a monkey, but it's alright
Like a load on your back that you can't see, ooh but it's alright
Try to shake it loose, cut it free, just let it go, get it away from me.

Cos tonight, tonight, tonight - oh, I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight - oh.

I'm going down, going down, like a monkey, ooh but it's alright
