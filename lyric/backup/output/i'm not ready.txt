You know what you wanna do
See, I'll never ever go nowhere yet
Think of all the times

Baby, we've been freakin' from dusk till dawn
And I'm still not ready to go on
That's the way it flows when it gets real good
Back to back flexin' my manhood

(Oh, baby) Why does it got to be so good
(Oh, baby) Girl, you know you got me hooked
(Oh, baby) Girl, you know you got me shook
(Oh, baby) And I ain't goin' nowhere

I'm not ready to end this freaky affair (Girl, I'm not ready)
I'm not ready to go nowhere
I'm not ready to get my clothes and go
