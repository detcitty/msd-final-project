Ever since the time that I was ten years old
I dream about the way it would be
Mama had me playing on that classical piano
But that was not the music for me
I had my very first introduction
By singing in a local band
I've got my rock and my roll instruction
Playing every club in the land

I made a deal with the angel of music
