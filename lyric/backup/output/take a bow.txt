Take a bow
The night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low the curtains down
There's no one here
(there's no one here)
(there's no one in the crowd)

Say your lines but do you feel them
Do you mean what you say?
When there's no one around
(no one around)
Watching you watching me
One lonely star
(one lonely star)
(you don't know who you are)

I've always been in love with you
(always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true
(you know it's true)
You took my love for granted
Why oh, why?
This show is over say goodbye
Say goodbye (bye-bye)
