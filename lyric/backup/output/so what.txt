Here we go

They say he do a little this, he do a little that
He always in trouble and I heard
He's nuttin' but a pimp, he's done a lot of chicks
He's always in the club and they say

He think he slick, he's got a lot of chips
He's sellin' them drugs and I heard
He's been locked up, find somebody else
He ain't nuttin' but a thug

So what, so what
So what, so what

Hey hey and they say I'm a slut, I'm a ho, I'm a freak
I got a different girl every day of the week
You're too smart, you'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard that they say about me

They say that I'm this, they say that I'm that
But all of it's fiction, none of it's fact
But you don't be hearin' it about your lover
You let it go in one ear and out the other

Now he say, she say, they say, I heard
If they fake we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her, misery needs company

So don't listen to that vine of grapes
They're nuttin' but liars hatin'
