It, it's you, it, it, it's you
It's you she's [Incomprehensible] about, yeah [Incomprehensible]

Yeah, let's [Incomprehensible], come on
Ooh, work it, baby
Give me that vibe, what is it?

Ya got that vibeology, that V I B E ology
Your body is pumped next to me
Ya got that sensuality

And oh I love what ya do, when ya do what ya do
Ya got me pumped in the groove when ya move
I'm in a funky way, I'm, I'm in a funky way, I'm
I'm in a funky way, horny horns, oh, come on

Ooh yeah, I'm in a funky way
Give me that, I'm in a funky way
Give me that vibe, I'm in a funky way
Give me that vibeology

Vibeology
Now you ask what does it mean?
Why, it's the study of the chemistry
Between you and me

Ya got that vibeology, that V I B E ology
