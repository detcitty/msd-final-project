Yeah, this right here
It's goin’ out to all dem girls out there
That did me and South wrong, ya know
Tell y'all a lil' story, it's da reason
(Uh, uh)

Love, hate, mistakes
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
Debates all day
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
Too late heart break
Tell me what you think is goin’ on
What's goin’ on, what's goin’ on

Hey yo, me and miss thang we were the perfect team
We had all the things all them other couples feign
Love, trust, good sex and security
If you ever felt weak Smilez was your energy

Trips across seas showed you the finer things
No more Burger King it was fine dine cuisine
And if we never had it, I don't think it mattered
We were a class A like Nas and Illmatic

I was so deceived, I thought we had a thing
Used to blow my two way up with one, four, three’s
The L O V had me blind I wouldn't of seen
I trusted my friends all they were yellin' at me

How could you do me so wrong, I don't wanna get gone
I invested three years ma plus this song
I’m so confused where to go, how do I choose
I guess to find real love I gotta pay my dues
