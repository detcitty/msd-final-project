I don't want a lover
I just need a friend
I don't want a lover
I just need a friend

You can't just leave me
To face life on my own
I know you don't love me no more
I knew this day it would come
Even when it cuts so deep
It's true I still want you
But the harder I try
The more I seem to lose

I don't want a lover
I just need a friend
I've had time to recover
