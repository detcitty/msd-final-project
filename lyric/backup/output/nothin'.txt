Homeboy, I came to party, 
your girl was lookin' at me
She's a haggler naw I'm not taggin' her
But you don't want them boys to come over and start askin' ya
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you trynna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you wanna do, nigga? (Nothin')
What you trynna do

Yo N-O-R papi say what, that nigga's the man
With his manager Chris and the label that Jams
Still flossin', showin' your rocks
Ain't you dudes heard "Grimey" man we stoled your watch
It goes Indian style, he's bent in dashiki
Strapped with the veritek baby tec B.T.
True she at the bar lookin' good in the brown dress
Four to six shots and them things ain't around yet
Persona all thugged out loud and clear
Sayin' fuck the straight Henny, just grab me a beer
You see I'm reppin' now, and my mami's I got a weapon now
Shoot at them clowns at they feet, they high steppin' now
Left that wack label cause I don't like pricks
I'm like a hammer that you hold on your hand, I make hits
At the white boy club whylin' buyin the bar
They like hey now, you're an all star, it go
