In a town near Albuquerque
Lived a most concerned young boy
He said lately I have noticed
Folks don't live with peace and joy

With frowns and worry on their faces
They're lost and don't know where to go
He said I'll get the people straightened
By putting on a puppet show

The young New Mexican puppeteer
He saw the people all lived in fear
He thought that maybe they'd listen to
A puppet telling them what to do

You know he got some string and he got some wood
He did some carving and he was good
