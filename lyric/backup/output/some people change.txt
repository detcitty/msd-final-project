His old man was a rebel yeller
Bad boy to the bone
He'd say, "Can't trust that other feller"
He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin

He was raised to think like his Dad
Narrow mind, full of hate
On the road to nowhere fast
Till the Grace of God got in the way

Then he saw the light and hit his knees
And cried and said a prayer
Rose up a brand new man
Left the old one right there

Here's to the strong
