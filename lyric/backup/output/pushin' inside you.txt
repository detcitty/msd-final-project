You know, I know it's gonna be good girl
I can feel your water streaming down all around
Here's my love, am I qualified in your eyes?
I can feel myself deeper, deeper inside (pushin' in yo body)
Ohhhhh... lay you by my sideI'll let you light my fireI can see it in your
Eyes

Sho' feels damn good to me
When I'm pushin' inside of you (pushin' inside you)
Can't explain the way it feels
All I wanna do is be wit' you (all I wanna do is be wit' you)
