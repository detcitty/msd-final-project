* this version features a Trina and Tamara rap
Ya say cats dancing up in here
Hey yo, ya'll cats wanna dance?
My jewelry say it all
Girls that pass, knee buckle
Ten G rings my as you knuckles
Why play me up close?
Man you slow like a tug boat
All my nigga's love pote
Bunch of OJ's cuz they cut throats
No scrubs, my man playin my ride
Hundred bottles you see right there
Ya'll wanna dance? I'll be right here
1 - Don't stop the beat movin'
