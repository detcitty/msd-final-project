i can't believe u had the nerve to say the things u said
they hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
i can't believe it .4 years gone down the drain
oh how i wish things would of happened so differently
i try'd to save it so many times but you still couldn't see
u kept insistin' and resistin' that u would not fall again
and now ur tryin' to tell me that ur sorry
and ur tryin' to come back home
ur tellin' me u really need me crying beggin both knees are on the floor
but baby i

don't wanna try don't wanna try don't wanna try no more
