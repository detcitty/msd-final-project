Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself paying the diamond above
But honestly I've never had much sympathy
Cuz those bad things always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run, run away, run run away, run away
Run away and never come back
Run run away, run run away, run away show em which color is black

She knows, she knows
Oh I, oh I-I-I
Alright
Oh I, oh I-I-I
Alright

Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man what you want, what you want
What these bitches want from a nigga
On some DMX shit
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit
