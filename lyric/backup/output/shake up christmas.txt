Ho, go, ho
Shake up the happiness
Wake up the happiness
Shake up the happiness

It's Christmas time
There's a story that I was told
and I wanna tell the world
before I get too old
and don't remember it
so let's December it

and reassemble it (oh yeah)
Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness

And be on Santa's magic list
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all

It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all

It's Christmas time

Ho, ho, ho
