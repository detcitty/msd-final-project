I can't wait until the sun goes down
I'm getting ready
See the moonlight on the town
I'm getting ready

I'm gonna put on my stepping shoes
'Cause I, I'm getting ready
Walk the streets and spread the news
I'm getting ready

I'm gonna call you on the telephone
Gonna tell somebody
There's a party going on

Shake it up tonight, ooh, ooh
Show you how to party right, yeah
Shake it up tonight, ooh, ooh
Show you how to party right, yeah

Gonna be a lot of people there
Don't you wanna be ready
There'll be coming from everywhere
I'm getting ready

Don't you know I wanna
Be with you tonight, oh, oh
Come on, baby
'Cause we're gonna do it right
I'm getting ready
