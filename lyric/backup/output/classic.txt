Hey, where's the drum?
Wooo oh
Let's go

Woo girl, you're shinin'
Like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never goin' out of style

Woo pretty baby
This world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me
When I just wanna make you smile

I wanna thrill ya like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinkin' I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, livin' in a world gone plastic
