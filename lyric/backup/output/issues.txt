I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down, I get real down
When I'm high, I don't come down
But I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I can leave you just as fast

But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
