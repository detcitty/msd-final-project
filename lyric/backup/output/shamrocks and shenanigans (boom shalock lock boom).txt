I kicks the flava like Steven King writes horror
If I was a Jew then I'd light a menorah, I got rhymes for ya
Excuse me senora, are you a whore or are you a lady
Is it Erica Boyare or Marcia Brady
Let me know hon, the deed'll get done
Just assume the position and I'll take my rod
And then I'll go fishin', I'll get your river flowin'
When it comes to givin' pleasure I'm every woman's treasure
I came to work your body, so let me do my job
I've never been laid off, my rhymin' skill paid off
'Cause now I'm makin' records, now I'm makin' tapes
Steady bustin' suckers in bunches like grapes
Makin' all the papes, scoopin' up the loot
Puttin' suckers on the run pull my gun and then I shoot
I never been a front, I never been a fraud
