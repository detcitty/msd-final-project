Where do we go from here?
What must we do to make that change?
It's time to understand, understand one another

In a world so cold a place of disbelief
Where will the people go without enough to eat
Let's not give up hope
We have to find a way
Search within our soul to make a better day

Chorus:
This house is our house
Let's do it for the people
