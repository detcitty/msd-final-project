Backfired
Your plan, your plan
Backfired

Backfired
My man, your plan
Backfired in your face

You came into my life to test me
Your diplomatic drag depressed me
And even your eyes undressed me

You were poly-slick, really thick
Wasting time, dropping lines
Like I could get you into movies
But we wound up at 'Hoy Joys' for hamburgers to go

Backfired
Your plan
Backfired

Backfired
My man, your plan
Backfired in your face
