She saw me walking down the streets
Of your fine city
It kinda turned me on when she looked at me
And said, "C'mere"
Now I don't usually talk to strangers
But she looked so pretty
What can I lose,
If I, uh, just give her a little ear?
"What's up little girl?"
"I ain't got time to play."
Baby didn't say too much
She said, "Are you gay?"
Kinda took me by suprise
I didn't know what to do
I just looked her in her eyes
And I said, "No, are u?"
Said to myself, said
"She's just a crazy, crazy, crazy
Little mixed up dame.
She's just a victim of society
And all it's games."
Now where I come from
We don't let society
Tell us how it's supposed to be
Our clothes, our hair
