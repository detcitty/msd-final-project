Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby, just say pretty please

I'll be back at 11, you just act like a peasant
Got a bow on my panties because my ass is a present
Yeah, it's gooder than Meagan, you look good when you're beggin'
I appreciate the gifts like the whips and them bezzles
Now it's bells and the whistles, now I'm makin' it sizzle
And it's ready, come and get it, it's takin' off like a missile
Let me see what you're workin' with, If I'm ridin', I'm murkin' it
Slow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah, I bagged him, I Birkin'd it

I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine, no
I don't need a pretty poet
