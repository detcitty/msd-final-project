No good, two timin', lies comin' outta your mouth
Cheatin', mistreatin' games that you play brought you down
Broke my heart, tore it apart, look who's got the last laugh now
Don't you come crawlin' begging please on your knees, baby if you're missin' me

Well, you can hear me on the radio
You wanna turn me on, turn on your stereo
You can sing along, while they're playin' our song. How you done me wrong...
Baby crank it up
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck
So listen Romeo, when you're feelin' kinda lonely, let me tell you where to go
