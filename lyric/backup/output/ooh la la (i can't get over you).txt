Ooh la la, ooh la la, I cant, can't get over you

I remember the day, it was oh so sad
She was the sweetest dearest friend I ever had
She could talk to me almost anytime
And at the end of my day I felt fine
Her mother broke the news to my heart
She said they're leaving and now I'm torn all apart
I think I'll never forget that day
And for you girl this is all I have to say
