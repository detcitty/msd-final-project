I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said I had it coming to me
But I wanted it that way

I think that any lovin's good lovin'
So I took what I could get, mmm ooh ooh
She looked at me with big brown eyes
And said

You ain't seen nothing yet
B-b-b-baby you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothin' yet
Here's somethin' that you're never gonna forget
B-b-b-baby you just ain't seen n-n-n-nothing yet

And now I'm feeling better
