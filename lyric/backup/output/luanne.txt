Luanne, Luanne
Why do you run and hide?
Luanne, Luanne
Don't keep your love inside

I wait around for you after school
You slip away and I don't see you
Don't know what I'm gonna do
If you can't see how much I need you
We met, one day, and then, you ran away
I've searched the whole town looking for you
I know you're there somewhere
