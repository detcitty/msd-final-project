I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene or sneak away to the Philippines
They still gon' put pictures of my derri√®re in the magazine
You want a piece of me? You want a piece of me?

I'm Miss Bad Media Karma
Another day, another drama
Guess I can't see the harm in working and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God, That Britney's Shameless! (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. Extra, Extra, This Just In (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin (You want a piece of me?)
