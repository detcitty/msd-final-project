How can I explain, I never meant to cause you pain?
I'm standin' out in the rain.
Maybe you're thinking,
Maybe it's a game, but I feel so all alone
I call but you're never home.
I feelin' like your heart is gone.

Tell me baby, tell me I'm wrong
Tryin' to make you understand
Just want to be your man.
