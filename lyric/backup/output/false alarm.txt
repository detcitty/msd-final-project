Bathroom stalls for the powder nose (She loves)
High heel shoes with the open toes (She loves)
She's got a good time wrapped in gold (She loves)
For you, for you
All red dress with the devil eyes (She loves)
So obsessed with the camera lights (She loves)
You love her, but you can't deny (She loves)
The truth, the truth

She loves everybody
Can't you tell by the signs?
She loves everybody
She gets off all the time
It's a dark philosophy
And it haunts her constantly
It's a false alarm to me
