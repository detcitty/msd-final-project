We've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
the hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange
he asks a man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes
get a job you fucking slob is all he replied.

God forbid you ever had to walk mile in his shoes
'cause then you really might know what its like to sing the blues
then you really might know what its like (what its like)
then you really might know what its like (what its like)
then you really might know what its like (what its like)
then you really might know what its like (what its like)
