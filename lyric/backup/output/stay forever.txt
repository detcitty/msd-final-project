Outside my window, rain is falling down
And I can see your face, mirrored in my mind
I have to wonder, is this just a dream?
Are you thinking of me looking through your window too?
And I'll make a wish and send it out to you
I've got all my heart and all my love to give
I didn't mean to make you hurt or make you cry
I still feel this love, girl, deep inside... 

I wanna stay forever with you
Feeling every heartbeat so close to mine
I wanna stay forever with you
Holding on to every breath
Stay forever with you
