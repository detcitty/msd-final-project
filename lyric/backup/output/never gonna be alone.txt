Time, is going by
So much faster than I
And I'm starting to regret not spending all of it with you
Now I'm wondering why, I've kept this bottled inside
So I'm starting to regret not telling all of it to you
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know

You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall
You're never gonna be alone
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone
