We're movin' on up
To the east side (We're movin' on up)
To a deluxe apartment in the sky
We're movin' on up (We're movin' on up)
To the east side (We're movin' on up)
We finally got a piece of the pie

Watch these grown men get it, know fo' sho'
Yo, get your back up off the wall and get your feet on the floor
You see the boy at the bar wit the glass so tall
When I'm done baby dogg I'ma show you Baltimore
Right now we gon' party, Bacardi give me some more
It's off the rack the club packed, I'm two-cut like two doors
Of course I do my two-step, I give 'em too much
I mustered up bad, I drop ashes in my cup
I had enough they throwin' bows, see they swingin and shit
I got my arm around this smut dame, puttin' in work
Before we merk I got to book somethin'
So baby stop frontin'
I got the drink and the smoke
Ain't got to buy nothin'
Not bluffin, it's goin' down understand me
I like my birds nasty, I burst in them cashmeres
Everything, and you know what I came for
Right now it's goin' down, let me on the dance floor

Whoa now, that's what the old heads say
