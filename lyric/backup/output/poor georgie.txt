I met him in a club hangin out one night
He said, hello I'm george. hi lyte!
How's everything goin, huh, how ya doin?
Hope everything's fine, ooh, and umm
Can I call you sometime? can I get the digits?
And the address, so I can come visit?
I gave him the digits, that wasn't a problem
Cause if he caused any, I would have to solve them
Cause george looked good, mmm damn good!
And if I didn't, some other girl would
In my mind, I hope for the best
Convincing myself that this was not a test
Cause I heard many things about georgie
Nothing kinky, like no orgies
I heard he knows how to make love
Like an angel from the heaven above
Who was I kidding I'd give him a try
Cause lyte needs love too and that ain't no lie
Keep your ears open, hope that you listenin
Cause I'm about to take you on a george porgie mission

Can it be I've stayed away too long (2x)

I gave him the number, I saw it in his eyes
She gave me the number? hmmm I'm surprised
Good conversation, over the phone
He began to come for me whenever I was alone
George was sweet, so nice and so neat
