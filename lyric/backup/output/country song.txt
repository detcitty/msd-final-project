Well I can't stand to look at you now, this revelation's out of my hands
Still I can't bear the thought of you now, this complication's leaving me scared
Stay when you think you want me, pray when you need advice
(Hey) keep your sickness off me, trying to get through
Blame all your weakness on me, shame that I'm so contrite
(Hey) keep your fingers off me, why can't I get through
You think you have the best of intentions
I cannot shake the taste of blood in my mouth

(Hey) I keep on thinking that it's (Hey) all done and all over now
