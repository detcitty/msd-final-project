And we don't stop no more, what's the problem?
Always complain when there's chicks that are starving
What type of game is this?
I used to support you, I thought you'd appreciate
Some of the things that I bought you

Shoes from Milan, Louis Vuitton
Animals on back and jewels in your arm
Money is nothing to make moves with at dawn
Roll in the big fish, leave them fools in the pond

Just when I made up my mind, I don't want you at all now
You had your chance, you owned me
What makes you wanna call now?
