What of the dollar you murdered for
Is that the one fighting for your soul
Or your brother's the one that you're running from
But if you got money, fuck it, because I want some

Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muthafuckin
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the

They want the, they want the, they want the

I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grande, from Friday, to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day
Yup, She trying get me that poo-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu Tang
I'm rolling with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr! I'm pulling up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fucking villain, man, they kneeling when I walking in the building
Freaky women I be feeling from the bank accounts I'm filling

What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D that's killing everything that he see

Ain't nobody fresher than my muthafuckin
