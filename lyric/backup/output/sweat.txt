Girl I wanna make you sweat
I love the way you do it like that
She a keeper, she keep that pussy wet
She a slurper til it ain't nothing left
The way she drop it on the floor
And baby I know what you want
Yeah girl I got what you need
I’m riding in the ‘gatti with the windows full of steam

Boom let it out now
You're a freak baby, gon’ let it out now

Boom let it out now
You're a freak baby, gon’ let it out now

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Yeah, tell me what you want, tell me what you want do
Way you spread it out girlfirend I want you
I-I-I’ma put it on you
Tell me when you’re coming baby, I’ma come too
You’re a pretty little thing, shawty I can’t even lie
You racking up them sky miles cause you stay fly
You do it so well, you don’t even gotta try
Got a nigga staring out the corner of my eye

And the way her body be banging
I swear you gotta be drinking every bottle in the club
Wake up with a story to tell
I’m just tryna have some fun, and I ain't looking for love

Girl I wanna make you sweat
I love the way you do it like that
She a keeper, she keep that pussy wet
