You're the sunlight that opened my eyes
When the world was tumbling down
You're the river that gave me a drink
When a drop of water couldn't be found

You give me what I want when I want it
And all I'll ever want is you, ooh, ooh

I was born to be loved by somebody
And I know that somebody is you
I'm gonna love you til the day that I die
And there ain't nothing that nobody can do

I love the way you
Make love when you make it
And I just wanna make it with you
