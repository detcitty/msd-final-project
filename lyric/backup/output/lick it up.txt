Yeah! Yeah!

Don't wanna wait till you know me better

Let's just be glad for the time together
Life's such a treat and it's time you taste it
There ain't a reason on earth to waste it
It ain't a crime to be good to yourself

Lick it up, lick it up, Oh! Oh!
It's only right now
Lick it up, lick it up, Oh! Oh! Oh!
Wooh yeah
Lick it up, lick it up, Oh! Oh! Oh!
Come on, come on
