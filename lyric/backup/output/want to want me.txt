Derulo

It's too hot to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor
Nothing on me
And I can't take it no more

It's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door
Where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave, yeah

In the back of the cab
I tip the driver 'head of time
Get me there fast
I got your body on my mind

I want it bad
Oh, just the thought of you
Gets me so high
So high
