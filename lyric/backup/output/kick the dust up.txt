Kick the dust up
All week long it's a farming town, they're making that money grow

Tractors, plows with flashing lights backing up a two lane road

They take one last lap around,

That sun up high goes down
and that song come on girl kick it on back, Z71 like a Cadillac
We go way out where there ain't nobody,
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard end up in a four door burning up a backroad song.
Park it and we pile out, baby watch your step now, better have your boots on.
