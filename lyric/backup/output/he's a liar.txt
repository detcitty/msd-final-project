I was stunned by the light as I looked through your window
With the greatest intention not meaning to see
I was there in the dark, and I saw you together
You were up in his arms, I was down on my knees

Get the cards on the table, no need to pretend
You've got to be cruel to be kind
He can sell you his love, and you know you will pay 'cause
