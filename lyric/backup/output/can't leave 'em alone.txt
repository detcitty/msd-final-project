Yes one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me I handle mah business
Any City any town, touch down I do my thing
I'm a hustler baby I provide by any means
I'm a bring conversation, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley Azure
Out the headache an stress you done been through before
It's only been three months an I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back

My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them baby bye fall back
He's so good an he knows how to love me
But so hood an he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say
That he does it with the best,
runs it in the west

Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
'cause I am what he wants
his girl and I love it
