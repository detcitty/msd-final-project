Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Listen

If this ur favorite song, turn ur radio on
Play it for ur man or ur lady all day long
If this ur favorite song, turn ur radio on
Play it for ur man or ur lady all night long

It's amazing babe, how we let it go
On and on, for this long
You blaming me, I'm blaming you
I can't say you’re right, but I sure ain't wrong
Girl lately I, I’ve been thinking
And my thoughts are telling me, I’m tripping
Used to say I didn’t care, found your bags packed upstairs
With all that talking tough, I’m about to lose you

If this is my last chance (come on) to love you
I’m gonna play it like a grown man ought to
If I only got one shot (yeah) to win you
Then call me Jordan 4th quarter in 92, yeah
I'm gonna do it
No matter what your girlfriend said
I'm gonna do it
