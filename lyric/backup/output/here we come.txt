Another one

Here we go so wave your hands
For Missy, Maganoo, and Timbaland
We gon' show you how to party right
So pass the uhh and get the hype
Alright, we gon' party tonight

If you're livin' for love, start livin' for life
If you're having a baby, then make her your wife
If you're up in the club where the dub
It's like a bank sell to the highest bid put the cash in your bank
Girl I'm lovin' your booty, you can hoo to my blow
Then fish but please honey child, don't kiss

All I want is a freak when I'm up in the club
Maybe after the dance, dinner sharp, then the tub
I'm a nigga wit' class, you're a girl with a job
Taste of my neck like corn on the cob
I'm second to none, I'm freaky as ever
Go downtown, well I never

Uh, uh, well I'm the man, that they call Timbaland
Now he the bir-ba-bir-ba-bird, understand?
We gon' party, until the sun comes up
Bartender, you forgot to fill up my cup
Ain't no stoppin' until your draws start floppin'
There won't be no beef unless the disc stop jockin'
(What?)

She said this, and he said that
And he said that Timbaland can't rap
