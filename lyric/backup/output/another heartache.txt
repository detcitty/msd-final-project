I told you once I'm a jealous man

But you never want to listen to who I am.
We're divided completely out of touch

I guess that's why we seem to fight so much.

Believe me darling
this ain't no game

If yov think I'll be your fool
You better think again.
I know you love me
it just ain't right

I'm sick and tired of fighting
With you every night.
You say you don't wanna hurt me
