No matter what you think you pulled
You find it's not enough
No matter who you think
You know you won't get through

It's a given L.A. law
Someone's faster on the draw
No matter where you hide
I'm coming after you, you

No matter how the race is run
It always ends the same
Another room without a view awaits downtown

You can shake me for a while
Live it up in style
No matter what you do
I'm going to take you down

Shakedown, breakdown, takedown
Everybody wants
Into the crowded line
Breakdown, takedown
You're busted
