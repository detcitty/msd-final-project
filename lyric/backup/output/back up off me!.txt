Awwwwwwwwwwwwww yeah!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Everybody one, two, three, four
Everybody c'mon, whatchu waitin for?
Five, six, seven, eight
We rock the rhymes that are truly great
Ah yes yes y'all (yes y'all) yes y'all (yes y'all)
Yes to yes to yes yes y'all
Ah yes yes y'all (yes y'all) yes y'all (yes y'all)
Yes to yes to yes yes y'all

Ah two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said the rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was def and then it went this way
Apple to a cherry to a cherry to a plum
Don't stop rockin 'til I get some
It's up my back around my beck
WOO-HAH! I got the girl in check
It's up my back around my spine
Dr. Dre c'mon, your turn to rhyme!

[Dr. Dre]
C'mon everybody let's all get down
What we got it's a brand new sound
So nobody out there be misled
My name is Dr. Dre (and my name is Ed!)
Look in the skies! Look in the trees!
Who do you see? (D-R-E!)
Look in the skies! Look in the trees!
Who do you see? (D-R-E!)
I'm not a preacher or a teacher or electrician
Biter or fighter or a politician
Some people say, I'm a turntable magician
And I got the key, to your ignition
Young ladies, rock the house
