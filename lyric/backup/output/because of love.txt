When the white flag sails, covered in streaks of blood
There'll be an endless sea, of us rising up
And the preacher man, and the preacher's son
Will stand arm in arm, just like everyone

Me longing to be free, I won't let you fade away
We shed so many dreams, I'll let them fade away

In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
