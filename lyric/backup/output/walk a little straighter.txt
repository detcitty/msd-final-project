Walk A Little Straighter
Billy Currington

I remember lookin' up to look up to him.
An' I remember, most the time he wasn't there.
I'd be waitin' at the door when he got home at night.
He'd pass me by to go pass out in his chair.

An' I'd say: "Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're swayin', side to side.
Your footsteps make me dizzy,
And no matter how I try,
