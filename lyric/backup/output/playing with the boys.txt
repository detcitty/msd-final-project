I'd say it was the right time
To walk away
When dreaming takes you nowhere
It's time to play

Bodies working overtime
Your money don't matter
The time keeps ticking
When someone's on your mind, on your mind

I'm moving in slow motion
Feels so good
It's a strange anticipation
Knock, knock, knockin' on wood

Bodies working overtime
It's man against man
