Eee, eee
Held me close, then turned away
Said you wasn't sure
By the phone I stayed all day
This I can't endure
This I can't endure, baby
Girl, you know I don't pretend
Why I wanna be yours
So give me some confidence
This I can't endure, baby
This I can't endure
Baby, call me up on the telephone
And babe I'll tell you something
Lover, turn me on
I just got to have ya
Come turn me on
Ooh, lover come turn me on
I've just got to have ya
Come turn me on
Lover, turn me on
You know I got to have ya
