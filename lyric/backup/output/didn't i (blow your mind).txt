I gave my heart and soul to you, girl
(Now didn't I do it, baby, didn't I do it, baby?)
Gave you the love you never knew, girl, oh
(Didn't I do it baby, didn't I do it baby?)
I've cried so many times and that's no lie
It seems to make you laugh each time I cry

[Chorus]
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time
