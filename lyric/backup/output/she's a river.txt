Shadow let go
There's something you should know
I just found my new direction
And I hope you like the key
Like the air that led me to it
She's like the wind that sucked me through it
She's a river, and she's turning
There in front of me

Stand back, get back
She'll paint your blue skies black
She gives bullet proof protection
She got a resurrection feel
When I'm scared, and 'bout to lose
She gives me travelling shoes
She's a river and she's turning
There in front of me

And I go blind
Wasting my time
While the rivers in front of me
That's where I'm going to be

Shine on, get on
Twilight from dusk to dawn
She's the spirit of creation
