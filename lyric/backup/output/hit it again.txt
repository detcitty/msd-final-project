I make you say ooh, ooh
I make you say ooh

I got the dirty old hands of a drummer in a band
But I never really hit the sticks
I got the sunburned tan of every working man
Who's spent a minute in the ditch

And I ain't gonna try to tell another lie
You never should've let me in
'Cause I'm the type of guy who's never let inside
To show you where my hands have been

This is now, that was then
You broke my heart, I let you in
This is now, that was then
I fucked around with all your friends
