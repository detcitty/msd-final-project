Funkytown, nasty
(Hey, listen to the man)
Yeah, I'm the Godfather (baby)

People, people
We got to get over
Before we go under
People, people
We got to get over

Hey, country

Thank you for using Top40db.com.

Didn't say what you meant
Just changed
Brand new funky President

Stock market going up
Jobs going down
And ain't no funking
Jobs to be found

Taxes keep going up
I changed from a glass
Now I drink out of a paper cup
It's getting bad

People, people
We got to get over
Before we go under
