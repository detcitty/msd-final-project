Driving past your house again
I feel the same way I did then
I get weak, just thinking about you
It all began so easily
A look from you a glance from me
Then our eyes met like thunder & lightning

You and I, strangers lost in a moment
Eye to eye
We were caught unaware of the passion inside us

Love at first sight
I know that this can't be happening
