Well, I read it in town in the melancholy news
The front page story is our love is through
The hand of time is cold, I can't stand to hear the truth
Somehow I won't believe it till I've heard it from you

There's no time for talk and there's no place for tears
There's no reason to wonder after all of these years
Sure we had some good times and so who's to blame
It's so hard to tell when you both feel the pain
