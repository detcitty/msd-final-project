I want you to take over control

I think it's time to let you know
The way I feel when you take hold
One single touch from you, I'm gone
Still got the rush when I'm alone
I think it is time I let you know
Take all of me, I will devote
You set me free, my body's yours
It feels the best when you're involved

I want you to take over control
Take over control
Take take take take over control
Oh oh oh, I want you to take over control
Plug it in and turn me on
