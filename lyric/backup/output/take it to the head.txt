Working all winter
Shining all summer
I ain't no beginner
You scared toâ€¦

Take it to the head, (yeah, yeah)
Don't think about it, be about it
Don't be scared to take it to the head (yeah, yeah)
Girl, you fly but if I tell you then you might take it to the head

I'm in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I'm gone
Take it to the head
I'm in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I'm gone
Now we gon' get fucked up, no excuses no apologies

Reputation for Gs; thats the role of a boss
So amazing to see, black baguettes in my watch
She say love is for free, just expensive to shop
But its nothing to me, that extends from my block
I got a lot of figures, I'm a father figure
She know a lot of niggas, don't know a hotter nigga
Come to the winners circle, a lot of men will hurt you
But I'm here to nurture, I wanna take you further
She got all them purses, I say in my verses
YSL and Hermes and barely scratch the surface
She know on purpose, as I peel the curtains
