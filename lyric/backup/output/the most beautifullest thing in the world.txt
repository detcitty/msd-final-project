Y'all mythological niggaz is comical
The astronomical is comin through like the flu bombin you
And embalmin in your crew too
With the musical mystical magical, you know how I do
With word attack skills and vocabulary too
My rendition of this Edition is all brand New
You're through, I'm inter-planetarian like Doctor Who (who who?)
So Who! (who?)
Born to get tripped on, word is bond
I'm kickin rhymes til the A.M. vultures swarm
Not Quincy but I'm Back on the Block and not sellin crack
I'm comin in with the fat funk flows and tracks
So what you sayin black, with all that yackedy yack
My artifacts can't be beat with bats
I'm sayin, I eat up everthing up on the menu
and bend you and send you swayin, to be continued...
The most beautifullest thing in this world, is just like that!
