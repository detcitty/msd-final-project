Been in pain and I've been in shame
But ain't love a bitch
I been in fights, locked away for nights
But ain't love a bitch
I been tailed, impaled, strung up
and nailed and left without a stitch
I been scratched 'n' taxed 'n' finally axed
But ain't love a bitch

Oh I didn't understand till I was seventeen
She took me way upstairs and she wiped me clean
Oh I didn't realize she made a first class fool out of me
Oh Maggie if you're still out there the rest is history
