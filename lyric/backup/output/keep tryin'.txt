You've been missin'
Out on all the chances you've been given
Is it something within
Holding you back instead of livin'

Your day is coming though it seems far
Things will be clear when you love who you are
Nothin' can stop you as long as you listen to your heart

Lift your head to the sky and keep tryin'
Believe in you and it will take you higher
