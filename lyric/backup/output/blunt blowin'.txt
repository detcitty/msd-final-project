Yeah
I put my shades on.

I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ughh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but f-ckin nevermind
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home
Yeah and I'm a blunt blowin'

Polo draws showin'
I don't give a lovely motherf-ck ass nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga
