Ok now ladies (Yeah)
If you know you bad (Yeah)
Don't need no man, got yo own bands, put up yo hands
If you a top notch bitch let me hear you holler
Bend it over (Yeah),
Touch ya toes, whip it out (Yeah)
show them hoes ya bank roll
Slang it out, hit a broke ho with it
Poke it out, Damn Shawty you can get it

If you got some good p-ssy say (YEAAAAH?)
If you got some good head on ya shouldeeeeers
If you got some good p-ssy say (YEAAAAH?)
If you never let a hoe f-ck you over
If you 'bout yo' check, drank Moet
Know the p-ssy stay wet, I need all dat
Tattoos on the back, I see all dat
You already got a man, I ain't tryna be all dat

I'm just tryna hit it by the end of the night
Lil' mama so bad and her booty so tight
When I hit it from the back, don't fuss, don't fight
