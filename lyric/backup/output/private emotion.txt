Every endless night has a dawning day
Every darkest sky has a shining ray
And it shines on you, baby, can't you see
You're the only one who can shine for me

It's a private emotion
That fills you tonight
And a silence falls between us
As the shadows steal the light

And wherever you may find it
Wherever it may lead
