To the left to the right
Step it up, step it up it’s alright
To the left and to the right
Check the new ride out it’s alright

Silence ain’t in season
'Cause there ain’t no good in grief
Can’t stop my mouth form breathin’
Or seein’ what I see

Curves with destinations
Poetic symmetry
Ya 'cause an inflammation
In my anatomy, don’t you see, oh

Yeah yeah yeah, you can’t send a forget-me-not
Yeah yeah yeah, but I’ll still reach up to the top
Yeah yeah yeah, until the last day that I drop
Yeah yeah yeah, this is something you can’t stop

From infancy I grown
The message that I’m givin’
You don’t have to be alone, no you don’t
Cos days may come and go come and go
