We were havin' such a good time, baby
Oh, yes, we were
Then you went and spoiled the whole thing, baby
In front of everyone

You're tellin' me I was wrong
And that all night long I was staring at someone else
Well, even if you were right
There's no need to fight, there's no need to get upset

Don't you get so mad about it (Do you have to get so mad)
Don't you get so mad about it (About it, about it)
Don't you get so mad about it (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't you get so mad about it, hey (Mad about it)
