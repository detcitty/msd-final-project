Didn't you ever want to climb
The highest mountain you could find?
Didn't you ever want to do it all?
Didn't you ever want to do it all?

Long ago I heard a voice
Telling me I had no choice
Take a chance 'cause even if you fall
At least you know you tried to do it all

Some changes are for good
And this I know for sure
Some things in life are meant to be
