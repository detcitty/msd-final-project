Dear Matthew,
I like you a lot.
I realize you're in a relationship with someone right now
and I respect that
I'd like you to know that if you're ever single in the future and you want to
Come visit me in California
I would be
Open to spending time with you and finding out how old you were
When you wrote your first song...

Dear Jonathan,
