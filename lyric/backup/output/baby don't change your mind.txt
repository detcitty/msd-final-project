Your ex is back in town
What you gonna do when she comes around
And she starts going through her act
Will she make you to you change your act
Will your love for me remain intact
Or will you run to her

Baby, my love is on the line
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it, don't you change it
