Shake your money maker
Like somebody boutta pay ya
I see you on my radar

Don't you act like you afraida
She...
You know I got it

If you want it, come get it
Stand next to this money
Like - ey ey ey

Shake your money maker
Like somebody boutta pay ya
Don't worry about them haters
Keep your nose up in the air

You know I got it
If you want it, come get it
Stand next to this money

Like - ey ey ey
Shake shake shake your money maker
Like you were shaking it for some paper
Took your mama 9 months to make ya

Might as well shake what ya mama gave ya
You ... you looking good in them jeans
I bet you look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind

But yous a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got * on my right side pouring some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't giving a fuck
So feel free to get lose and get carried away

So by tomorrow you forgot what you was saying today
But don't forget about this feeling that I'm making you get
