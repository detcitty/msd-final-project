If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
Don't want it

Think about it all the time
Thinking only makes me smile
And say, hey (hey, hey)

(Got a love hangover)
I don't wanna shake it
(Got a love hangover)
I love the love you're making

If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it
If there's a remedy
I'll run from it
Run from it

Think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you (love you)
(Love you, love you, love you, baby)
