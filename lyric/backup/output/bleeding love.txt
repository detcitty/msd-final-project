Oooh oooh heeey.
Closed off from love
I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass

Before you know it you're frozen
Oooh.
But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true

And everyone's looking around
Thinking I'm going crazy
Oooh heeey.
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away

But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
