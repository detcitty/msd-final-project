Give it to me, I'm worth it
Baby I'm worth it
Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it
Give it to me, I'm worth it

Uh huh, I'm worth it
Gimme gimme I'm worth it

Okay, I tell her bring it back like she left some
Bring it-bring it back like she left some
Uh, in the club with the lights off
What you actin' shy for, come and show me that you
Wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it
Stop playin', how you know that I
Wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it, wid it
What you actin' shy for?
Just gimme you, just give me you
Just gimme you, that's all I wanna do

And if what they say is true
If it's true, I might give me to you
