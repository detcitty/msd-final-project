You left your bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
'Cause I can't seem to talk to God
Without yelling anymore
And when I sit at your piano,
I can almost here those hymns
The keys are just collecting dust
But I can't close the lid.

You left my heaart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
