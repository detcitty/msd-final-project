Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, give it to me now

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now

I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, ahh ahh, you make it so good, I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, kn-kn-kn-know what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy

I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ahh ahh, you make it so good, I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, kn-kn-kn-know what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy

I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the fifty yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for tree
And if you like in the club we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.

Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked, don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand

Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park, to the Point, to the Flatlands
That man Ludacris, woo

In the public bathroom or in back of a classroom
However you want it lover, lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I past 'em, get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
