I'm taking you back
I'm taking you back
Here's another one

[Queen Pen]
Uh, yeah
I remember being on that nigga's chair, hard
Back in the day in the projects
Chasing after him, a lil' young chick
Seeing him made me go back in my lab
And write this lil' shit like this
Check it out

Here's how it goes
Used to see you when I went to the store
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs
With hopes to get close to you

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet
