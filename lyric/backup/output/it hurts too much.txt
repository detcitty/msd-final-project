(Eric Carmen)

A lot of empty words that I've already heard
Ain't gonna work tonight
Don't wanna talk about it anymore
'Cause that ain't gonna make things right
So now you're back again, you say it's not too late
To give it one more try
Well, I don't want to hear your lies
No, I don't want to hear your lies no more

I've got to find a way, I know, to let you go
'Cause it hurts too much
You say you'll never leave
And then, you're gone again
Oh, it hurts too much
It hurts too much, my love
I've heard it all before
I've got to tell you no, no, no
