Give me an inch, girl
Give me an inch, girl
Give me an inch, girl
Give me an inch, girl
My eyes show no more than I've seen
But unlike my poor heart they're not cautious
I get to thinking love was a dream
Misunderstanding my fortunes
I should have taken more heed of my heart
Telling me how to live
But give me an inch, girl
I'll give you a mile
give me an inch, girl,
Oh, come on girl, make me smile
