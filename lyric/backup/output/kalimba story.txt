Saw it in a store one day
Thought it might make me play
Future music all for you

Seen me through my hardest time
Thought it was 'bout time
To open up a new world just for you

Fills all my needs, gave me the key
Door was open for me to see
Playin' around the world
Touchin' all the boys and girls
With a new love to make them free
