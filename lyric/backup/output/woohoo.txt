You know you really wanna (hey), wanna taste my
You know you wanna get a peek wanna see my
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips are
Kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)
All the boys think it's cake when they taste my (woohoo)
You don't even need a plate, just your face Ha!
Licky-licky yum-yum what a great guy
Now kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)
Kiss on my, all over my

Kiss on my, all over my
Feel eyes on me everywhere I go
Like a little boy up in the candy store
Quit your craving and get your hands on
Give it up before momma says no
Imma let you get a little closer
Even though I ain't suppose to
I like it strong when it's long 'cause

I'm a little tipsy, play along with me
You know you really wanna (hey), wanna taste my
You know you wanna get a peek wanna see my
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips are
Kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)
All the boys think it's cake when they taste my (woohoo)
You don't even need a plate, just your face Ha!
Licky-licky yum-yum what a great guy
Now kiss on my (woohoo) all over my (woohoo)

Kiss on my, all over my
