There she was like a picture.
There she was, she was just the same.
There she was; he just had to know that she had forgot his name.
Ulay, Ulay, Oh.
Thinking back to the last time
On the wall as they turned away
Walking back; was it just a dream or did he hear her say:
Ulay, Ulay, Oh.
Tried his best to forget her.
Tried his best to just keep his stride.
