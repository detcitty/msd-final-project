I love it when you just don't care
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there
So when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what the people say
I love it when you don't take "no"
I love it when you do what you want cause you just said so
Let them all go home, we're out late
We don't care what the people say

We don't have to be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
â€˜Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So, baby, be the life of the party
I'm telling you, take your shot it might be scary
