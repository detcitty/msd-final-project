Ha

I've never seen you look like this without a reason
Another promise fallen through, another season passes by you

Shock

I never took the smile away from anybody's face
And that's a desperate way to look for someone who is still a child

In a big country, dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive
