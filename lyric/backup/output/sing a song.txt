When you feel down and out, sing a song
It'll make your day, yeah, yeah
You will come to shout, sing a song
It'll make a way

Sometimes it's hard to care, sing a song
It'll make your day
A smile so hard to bear, sing a song
It'll make a way

Sing a song
(Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it, sing a song)
