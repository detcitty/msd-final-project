There's trouble on the streets tonight
I can feel it in my bones, I had a premonition
That he should not go alone

I knew the gun was loaded
But I didn't think he'd kill
Everything exploded, and the blood began to spill

So baby, here's your ticket
Put the suitcase in your hand, here's a little money now
