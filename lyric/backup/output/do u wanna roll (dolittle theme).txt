feat. Lil' Kim, Snoop Dogg

[Snoop Dogg]
It's somethin about the West Coast
that makes these paper ends
Eastside! Eastside!
its somethin about the West Coast
that makes these paper ends
HELP ME SING IT!

[Chorus: R.L.]
Do You Wanna Ride? get high six-five
lets have some fun baby
lets have some fun
oh we'll get blowed and thats fa sho!
and hop on dubs baby and have some fun
now check this out!

[Verse One: R.L.]
Come on I'll hit you with the rolie ring
cotton candy with a shiesty drink
blazed with caress doin the right thing
and you kissed me once one on the cheek
I remember it like yesterday we'd hop on a bus
and just ride away I knew we would
run away someday and I'ma say if we do...

[Chorus: R.L.]
Do You Wanna Ride? get high six-five
lets have some fun baby
lets have some fun
oh we'll get blowed and thats fa sho!
