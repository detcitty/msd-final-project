Aye Yo... You don't have to love me...
you don't even have to like me...
but you will respect me...
You know why?
Cause I'm a boss!

Uh uh... watch the beat go...

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right i brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, i'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the bitch y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stakes
I told young stunna he should switch debate
I'm back with an 808 cause i'm bossy

Ooh lemme slow it down so ya can catch the flow
Screw it up make it go extra slow
Real girls get down on the flo
Ooh i gave you a taste you want some more
Touch down lemme do it up like a pro
I ride the beat like a bicycle, I'm icy cold
Ooh from the 6-4 hoppers up in crenshaw
The money makin playas up in harlem
Don't want no problems
We gon keep it pumpin while the 808 is jumpin
