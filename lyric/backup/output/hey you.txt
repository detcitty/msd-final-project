Hey you, you say you wanna change the world
It's alright, with me there's no regret
It's my turn, the circle game has brought me here
And I won't let down 'til every song is set

You realize now
You should have tried now, ooh
The music's gone now
You lost it somehow
Hey you, sha la la la
Hey you, sha la la la
