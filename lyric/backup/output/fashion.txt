There's a brand new dance
But I don't know its name
That people from bad homes
Do again and again
It's big and it's bland
Full of tension and fear
They do it over there
But we don't do it here

Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, turn to the right
Ooh fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep, beep-beep
