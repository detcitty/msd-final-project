WHAT AM I GONNA DO (I'm So In Love With You)

Can I tell you what you mean to mean
You're as central as the air I breathe
Almost impossible to believe that you're mine
You're like weekends all year long
under a hot Jamaican sun
You are a winner at a hundred to one
yes you are

Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees honey

What am I gonna do I'm so in love with you
