I knew when I first saw you on the showroom floor
You were made for me
I took you home and dressed you up in polyester
Princess of my dreams

Emotionless and cold as ice
All of the things I like
The way you look, the way you move
The sound you're makin'
In ultra-chrome, latex and steel

I plug you in
Dim the lights, electric Barbarella
Your perfect skin
Plastic kiss, electric Barbarella
