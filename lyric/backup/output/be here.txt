You should be here with me, babe
You should be here with me, babe
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
Girl, you know you drive me crazy
You should be here with me, babe
ohh... ohh... ouh girl I want you here
I just wanna drive you crazy
You should be here in the mornin' time when I'm makin' my breakfast
You should be here beneath me to feel me, to heal me
You should be here to ride me to trap me and climb me
You should be here, I'm a good man and I work hard on my night job
(You should be here)
Let me show you what you're missin' every day
(You should be here)
Once I get you, you ain't never gonna walk away
(You should be here)
Well, I got more than just a big stick and some money
(Girl, I wish you were here)
