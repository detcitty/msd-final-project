I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation under God
Real niggas getting money from the fucking start

I think I'm Big Meech, Larry Hoover
Getting work, hallelujah
One nation under God
Real niggas getting money from the fucking start

My Rolls-Royce triple black, I'm getcha ho
Balling in the club, bottles like I'm Ichiro
Ros√©, that's my nickname
Cocaine running in my big vein

Self-made, you just affiliated
I built it ground up, you bought it renovated
Talkin' plenty capers, nothing's been authenticated
Funny you claimin' the same bitch that I'm penetratin'

Hold the bottles up, where my comrades?
Where the fucking felons, where my dogs at?
Uh, I got that Archie Bunker
And it's so white I just might charge you double
