I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love on my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain

I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed so never mind
And it's worse but better times, seems further and beyond
The top gets higher, the more that I climb

The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga, it be on mo'fucker
'Cause all this bullshit, done made me strong mo'fucker

So I pick the world up, and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
Bitch I'ma pick the world up, and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head (Yeah)
