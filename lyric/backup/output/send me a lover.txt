I wasn't searching to end this hurting
But out of nowhere you made me feel
I cried about it, I lied about it
And tired to doubt this could be real

You've touched me far too much
I'm letting go of all the pain
I'm into you in every way

Send me a lover someone to believe in
Please send me someone that I can hold
Baby now
Send me a lover a new beginning
Someone to take away the cold
