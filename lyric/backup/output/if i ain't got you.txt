Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within

And I've been there before
I know that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
