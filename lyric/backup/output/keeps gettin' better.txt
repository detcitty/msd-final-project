Step back gonna come at ya fast
I'm drivin' out of control
and gettin' ready to crash
won't stop shakin' up what I can

I serve it up in a shot
so suck it down like a man
so baby yes I know what I am
and no I don't give a damn
and you'll be lovin'

Somedays I'm a super bitch
up to my old tricks
but it won't last forever
next day I'm your super girl
out to save the world
and it keeps gettin' better
