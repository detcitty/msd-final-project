Extra! Extra! I'm in love
I gotta thank my lucky stars above
Hurry, hurry, don't be late
I can't wait, I gotta celebrate
It's a fact, we got a first rate act
It's evident when we make love the main event
You're my every thought
You're my one attraction
You must be heavensent
You give me so much satisfaction
(You're the one)
You make life worth fighting for
You're the one
'Cause there's nobody quite like you
Honey, you're the one
Extra! Extra! I'm in love
