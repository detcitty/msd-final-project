Joanna, I love you
You're the one
The one for me

I'm in love
And I wouldn't lie
She's my girl
And always on my mind

She gives me her love
And a feeling that's right
Never lets me down
Especially at night

So I'm gonna do
The best that I can
To please that girl
And be her only man

You see, she picks me up
When I'm feeling low
And that's why, baby
I've got to let you know
