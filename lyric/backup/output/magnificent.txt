Justice League
It's Da Boss, it gets no better than this
Maybach music

Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with two M's in it
This living is so magnificent, stop dreaming it
I'm living it

Oh, I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you
I, I can show you, oh, I

I'm tha magnificent with tha sensational style
Far from bein' shallow 'cause she caught me wit a smile
Try to figure out my style, baby, that will take a minute
But if all we got is time, you can't be actin' timid

So we back to playin' tennis
We been goin' back and forth
She the one that I adore
So I tried it in aurar

Conscience intervened concentrating on my cream
I'm tha king, make a move, pawns all tha way to queens
I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a G
I'm a CEO which means that I profit off of me

All white T's still rockin' my Nike Airs
Fresh outta flight school 'cause I'm fly right here
Ain't nothin free, I'm chargin' to breathe air
