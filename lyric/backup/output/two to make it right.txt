It takes two, it takes two, me and you
It takes two, it takes two, me and you

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it out of sight

From the start it's plain to see
You're suffering from a serious broken heart,
You know that it's a shame
But I'm here to ease your pain
There's no need for you to feel so all alone
When you and I could seriously
Be a sure enough happening thing

Don't you know that
