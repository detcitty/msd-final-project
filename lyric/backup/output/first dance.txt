Fellas, it's the moment you've been waiting for
(Girl if you see something you like then let 'em know)
Ladies, I know you're ready
(Cuz you only got one chance for your first dance)
Yeah, yeah, you never forget your first dance
(So take advantage of the slow jam)
Tell 'em JB

When I close my eyes
I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here
Let's make it special (I'm here tonight)

So many thoughts in my mind
The DJ is playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Ain't no chaperons (chaperons)
This could be the night of your dreams
