Hold me like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee, you are my friend
Carry me like you are my brother
Love me like a mother, will you be there?

Weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost, will you find me?
But they told me, a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end but I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show to me
You'll be there for me and care enough to bear me?
