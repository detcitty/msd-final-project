Underneath the city lights
There is a world few know about
Where rules don't apply, no
And you can't keep a good girl down
She going through the club looking for a good time
Gonna make that
Shake that
Money on the dime
Don't need a sugga daddy
Shell be working it just fine
Up on the table
Shell be dancing all night (hee-eey)
Babydoll just come alive
Under the spotlight
All the girls wanna fall in line
We say

He-eh-eh-hey
Here come the ladies bout to give a little show
He-eh-eh-hey
Here comes the boozie gonna show a little more

Hit it up, get it up
Wont let you rest
Hit it up, get it up
This is not a test
Hit it up, get it up
Gotta give me your best
