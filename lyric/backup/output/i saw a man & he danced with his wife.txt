I Saw A Man And He Danced With His Wife
Cher

I was by myself drinkin' chilled lonely wine
Then he walked in with some woman
Who's place was once mine
And she wore his ring on her finger
And the band began a song, I'd heard before

I saw a man and he danced with his wife
How I wished he was dancing with me
