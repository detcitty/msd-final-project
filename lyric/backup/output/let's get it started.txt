- Let's get it started, in here...

And the bass keep runnin' runnin'...
And runnin', runnin'...
And runnin', runnin'...
And runnin', runnin'...
And runnin', runnin'...
And runnin', runnin'...
And runnin', runnin'...
And runnin', runnin' and...

In this context, there's no disrespect
So, when I bust my rhyme, you break your necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect collect the rhythm effect
To lose this inhibition, follow your intuition
Free your inner soul and break away from tradition
Coz when we beat out, girl it's pullin' without
You wouldn't believe how we wow shit out!
Burn it till it's burned out
Turn it till it's turned out
Act up from North, West, East and South!

Everybody, everybody, let's get into it (Yeah), get stupid (C'mon)
Get it started (C'mon), get it started (Yeah), get it started
Let's get it started... (Ha!)
Let's get it started... (In here!)
Let's get it started... (Ha!)
Let's get it started... (In here!)
