It's two tickets to a concert
It's a Daytona airbrush t-shirt
Wonderin' who's gonna kiss who first
You know what i'm talkin about
Hey baby what you doin' tonight?
It's butterflies and Bud Lights
Under the stars and on the stripes of a
Beach towel in a spring break town
It's playin' in the night air
Through the speakers all night long
Couple kids just livin' that American country love song
And every town and every place
