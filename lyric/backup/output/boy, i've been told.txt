Looking in your eyes
I see a memory
Of how it used to be
Before our world came tumbling down
I try, I did nothing else but try
To keep our love alive
Oh how I loved you so
And you just made me cry
Did you deceive me
Did you do me wrong
Boy, I can't take it
Can't take it anymore
I feel so helpless
Not knowing what to do
