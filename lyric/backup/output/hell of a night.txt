All we need is a July hot Saturday night
A couple cans all cool and the needle on full and a countryside
Yeah, a hot little playlist, every favorite songs
When I get you climbing up in the cab of this truck
Yeah you know it's on, know it's on

Show you a side of these two lanes you've never seen
Heating it up behind a high beam
