When will I be famous?

Yes you're suitably at one
With your body and the sun
Yes you are
Well you've read Karl Marx
And you've taught yourself to dance
You're the best by far
But you keep asking the question
One you're not supposed to mention

When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I see my picture in the paper?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
And I can't tell you when
You'll see your name up in lights
When will I, will I be famous?
You keep asking me, babe
