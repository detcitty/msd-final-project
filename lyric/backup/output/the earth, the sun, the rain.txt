When I was lost I could not see
All the beauty and wonder wrapping around me
I was alone dreaming of you
Oh, I could not imagine this dream coming true
So much joy now in all that I touch
You make me feel everything so much

I will love you for the earth at my feet
I will love you for the sun in the sky
I will love you for the falling rain, oh, oh
I will love you for the heart that could break
I will love you for the dreams that we share
I will love you for the falling rain, oh, oh

Face in the wind, tears from my eyes
