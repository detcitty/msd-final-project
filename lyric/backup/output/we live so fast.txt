Please don't ask me to stay
I'm leaving this town
Don't worry now
Believe me as I believe that
Luck is on my side
The future is mine
If I can find
A way through these strange days of my life

We live so fast
Motion, motion
No time to waste
Use it, use it
We live so fast
Motion, motion
Make the first step and reach out for tomorrow
We live so fast
Motion, motion
We can't stand still
Move it, move it
