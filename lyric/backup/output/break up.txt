When I kiss you so good
Why would you wanna break up?
When this lovin' is so good
Why would you wanna break up?

When I hit that so good
Why would you wanna break up?
When this feelin' is so good
Why would you wanna break up?

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up?

Do anythin' for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See, I been drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

Now baby girl had dumped me, she no longer wants me
I'm no longer hired, she said that I've been fired
On to the next one, more fish in the sea
Girls are like buses, miss one, next fifteen, one comin'

Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stuntin'
Swag so stupid still the bitch straight dumped me
Over, no more smokin' doja
Baby girl went AWOL, she used to be my soulja

Don't, don't I lace you with the Gucci?
Don't, don't I deck you in the Louis?
Don't, don't I make your earlobe freeze?
Don't, don't when I dive, I dive deep?

I know I be gone
I know I be gone
I know I be flirtin' with the girls
