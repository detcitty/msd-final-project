Climb on board
We'll go slow and high tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you

So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
