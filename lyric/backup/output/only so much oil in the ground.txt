There is only so much oil in the ground
Sooner or later there won't be much around
Tell that to your kids while you driving 'round downtown
That there's only so much oil in the ground

We can't cut loose without that juice
Can't cut loose without that juice
If we keep on like we doing
Things for sure will not be cool
It's a fact we just ain't got sufficient fuel

Cause there's only so much oil in the ground
Sooner or later there won't be none around
Alternate sources of power must be found
