Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

Shoppin' in Paris
We gon' go shoppin' in Paris, nigga
They can't even compare us
They can't even compare us, we're rarer than niggas
Rarer than niggas
I never'd 'magine this shit comin'
This shit comin'
We swimmin' in money, we drownin' in hundreds
I keep a duffle bag on me like Tity Boi and Dolla
Bruh we ain't takin' that weed, oh no
And if they don't love me, fuck whatcha talkin' 'bout
I'm in love with the cash, I put that on my mama and father
