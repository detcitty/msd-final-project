Oooooh, come on, ooh yeah

Well I tried to tell you so (yes I did),
But I guess you didn't know,
As the saddest story goes,
Baby, now I got the flow,
'Cause I know it from the start,
Baby, when you broke my heart,
That I had to come again,
And show you that I'm with.

You lied to me,
All those times I said that I loved you,
You lied to me,
Yes, I tried, yes, I tried,
You lied to me,
Even though you know I'd die for you,
You lied to me,
Yes, I cried, yes, I cried.

Return of the mack,
It is,
Return of the mack,
Come on,
