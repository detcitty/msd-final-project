Woh-u-woh
Woh-u-woh

Show me the colour of love
Somehow it seems like a sign from above
Get closer, love is all we need
The colour of love

I have been watching you all night
And I know you can feel it too
I'm trembling inside
I love you

Woh-u-woh
Back in time we met
Those days we had I'll never forget
Woh-u-woh
