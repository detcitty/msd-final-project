I know where I come from
How 'bout you?
I don't need baggy clothes
Or rings in my nose to be cool

The scars on my knuckles
Match these scuffs on these cowboy boots
An' there's a whole lot more like me
How 'bout you?

I punch the clock tryin' to make it to the top
How 'bout you?
I ain't got no blue-blood trust fund
I can dip in to
