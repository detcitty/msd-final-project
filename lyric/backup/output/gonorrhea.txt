Yeah
Sound like my mic is dry

Ugh, I am not a human
Shout to all my moon men
Yeah they call me Tune
Got them bitches tuned in
It’s a crazy world, so I stay in mine
And niggas don’t cross the line
Niggas stay in line
Like welfare, I’m St. Elsewhere
Hotter than a devil, nigga hell yeah
Roc-a-bye baby, homicide baby
That’s more tear drops, call me cry baby
What you talkin’ ’bout? Tell it to my nine
Cut your tongue out, mail it to your moms
I’m the young God, swagga un-flawed
Bitch I’m in the building, you in a front yard
Life’s a bitch, nahh better yet a dumb broad
And I bet I can fuck the world and make it cum hard
Yeah, you boys is washed up
And I’m shittin’ on ‘em like 2 Girls and 1 Cup
Weezy Baby aka bring the money home
Pull out a AK and pop ya in ya funny bone
Laugh now, die later motherfucker
