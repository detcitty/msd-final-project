If he loved you
Like I love you
I would walk away in shame
I'd move town
I'd change my name
When he watches you
When he counts to buy your soul
On your hand his golden rings
Like he owns a bird that sings

When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
The priest has said my soul's salvation

Is in the balance of the angels
And underneath the wheels of passion
I keep my faith in my fashion
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
I'm still in love with you
(I'm gonna find a place to live
