Song: Attack Of The Name Game

Attack of the name game
Attack of the name game

I was walkin' down the street keepin' time with my feet
When I heard the strangest sound
I saw a spaceship scene and a man in green
And a crowd was gathered 'round

Well, I stepped up close just to get a little dose
Of his rhymin' kind of game
Then he winked all three of eyes at me
And he said, "Did you catch my name"

It's Clack it back, I gotta Clack attack
I gotta Clee Cly Cloe the Clack a jack
Turn the Tyde, you gotta move the Myde
You gotta wham-bam funkify the Fyde with Clyde

I said, "Hey, Clyde, you're sure outside
Your rap is truly meaner
Now try some more," he said "For sure
Come on, let do Tina"

Tack it back, I gotta Tack attack
I gotta Tee Ty Toe the Tack a jack
Turn the Tina, gotta move the Mina
Gotta wham-bam funkify the Fina, Tina

Well, how 'bout Stevie
(That's easy)

Stack it back, I gotta Stack attack
I gotta Stee Sty Stoe the Stack a jack
Turn the Tevie, gotta move the Mevie
