Hot and dangerous
If you're one of us, then roll with us
'Cause we make the hipsters fall in love
And we've got hot pants on and up

And yes, of course we does, we're running this town just like a club
And no, you don't wanna mess with us
Got Jesus on my necklace
Got that glitter on my eyes

Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexyfied
So let's go-o-o
(Let's go!)
Tonight we're going hard

Hard, ha, ha, ha, hard
Just like the world is ours
Ours, ou-ou-ou-ours
We're tearin' it apart
Part, pa-pa-pa-part

You know we're superstars
We are who we are!
We're dancing like we're dumb
