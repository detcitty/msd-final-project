Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning

(Look)
We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She's up all night till the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night till the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

The present has no rhythm
