Should've seen it coming when roses died
Should've seen the end of summer in your eyes
Should've listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny how you never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are "know-it-alls" and I played that fool for you
I cried and I cried, there were nights that died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby
