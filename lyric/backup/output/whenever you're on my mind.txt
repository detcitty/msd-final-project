I think about you and forget what I've tried to be
Everything is foggy and hard to see
It seems to be, but can it be, a fantasy?

Whenever I think about you, strangers eyes in the crowd flash past
I go on and think of the fate you've cast
It seems to be a reverie, you're here with me

Whenever you're on my mind
Whenever you're on my mind
I leave the world behind
Whenever you're on my mind
