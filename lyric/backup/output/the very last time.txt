Sometimes I wonder if I'm still alive
How much abuse can someone stand and survive
How long I've waited for the day to arrive
When I won't be a fool no more

Nobody knows how you push me around
Nobody sees how you treat me like I'm your clown
I never made a sound

It's the very last time
You will get on my case
It's the very last time
'Cause I won't be a fool no more
