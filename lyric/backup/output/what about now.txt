The sign in the window said for sale or trade
on the last remaining dinosaur detroit made
seven hundred dollars was a heck of a deal
for a four hundred horsepower jukebox on wheels
and that road rolls out like a welcome mat
i don't know where it goes but it beats where we're at
we always said someday, somehow
we were gonna get away, gonna blow this town
what about now, how 'bout tonight
