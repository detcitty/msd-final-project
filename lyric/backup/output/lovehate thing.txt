Shout out to Marvin Gaye
Love you then they hate you
Then they love you again
Hate you then they love you
Then they hate you again

Hold me tight, let me go
Heal my heart, hurt my soul
Build me up, break me down
Make me smile, make me frown
Give me love, take it all away again
Give me love, take it all away again

Yeah, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me
Beef with over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me
Son of a mother studying at UDC
