It was late at night on the open road
Speeding like a man on the run
A lifetime spent preparing for the journey

He is closer now and the search is on
Reading from a map in the mind
Yes there's the ragged hill
And there's the boat on the river

And when the rain came down
He heard a wild dog howl
There were voices in the night, "Don't do it"
Voices out of sight, "Don't do it"
Too many men have failed before
