Lookin' back through time we are in debt to the leaders
Angels of mercy everyone
Good folks who believe there was no good and evil
Fought long and hard until the battles are were won

Heroes make the sun rise in the mornin'
Heroes make the moon shine bright at night
Heroes make our lives a little stronger
