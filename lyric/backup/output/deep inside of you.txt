When we met, light was shed
Thoughts free flow
You said you've got
something
Deep inside of you
A wind chime voice sounds
Sway of your hips 'round rings true
It goes
deep inside of you
These secret garden beams
Change my life so it seems
A fall breeze blows outside

I don't break stride
Thoughts are warm
And they go

deep inside of you

Oh yeah
Well I never felt alone
Alright
Oh oh uh, oh oh uh
Till I met you

Friends say I've changed
I don't listen
