Smooth up in ya

Mom
Whoa

I know you really want to move me
You know I like to see you try
I've said it before and I'll say it again
You're not my type if you don't give in

Looks like yours are hard to find
I ain't got that kind of time

Oh I send shivers

Smooth up in ya
Smooth up in ya
(In ya)

You say I'm never gonna break ya
