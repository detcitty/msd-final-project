I guess we're doing "Too Drunk to Fuck," right?

I hit the bottle in the morning in the summertime
I quit my job cause it gets in the way
I find a party by the ocean, buy the cheapest wine
Call up my friends to come and waste the day
I got a dimeback, corduroys, colored sleeves,
and a bindle, and some LSD
Now I'm just lookin for a girl to meet
to help me to forget my name

I could spend my lifetime gettin high
never wanna live in suit and tie
Most of us are just livin' a lie
Drunk, gettin' fucked up every night

I'm gettin' drunk all night
Oh, I'm gettin' drunk all day
Oh, I'm gettin' drunk all night
I'm sorry but I have to say,
I'm too drunk to fuck
