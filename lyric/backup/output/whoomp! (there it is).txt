Party people
yeah, Tag Team music in full effect
That's me DC the brain supreme
And my man Steve Roll'n
We're kicking the flow we're kickin' the flow
And it goes a little somethin' like this

Tag Team back again, check and direct and let's begin
Party on, party people, let me hear some noise
DC's in the house jump, jump, rejoice
There's a party over here, a party over there
Wave your hands in the air, shake your derier
These three words when you're gettin' busy

Whoomp there it is, hit me

Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is

Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is

Whoomp there it is
Whoomp there it is

Upside down and inside out
I'm about to show all you folks
What's it's all about
