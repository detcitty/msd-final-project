Used to live in the danger zone
Any day it could get too rough
Now I'm glad I kept holding on
Now I'm glad I had soul enough

You turned night into day
And showed me how my soul could sing
You took my hurt away
And showed me love conquers anything

When two hearts both feel the same
There's a way to beat the game

Holding on, now I'm standing in the light
Holding on, and this time I got it right
Holding on, every day and every night
Holding on, hold on

Fall asleep in your lover's arms
