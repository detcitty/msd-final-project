Let it snow
Let it snow
Let it snow

It's another Christmas holiday
It's a joyous thing, let the Angels sing
'Cause we're together

We got a thing, can't let it slip away
Go outside, it's raining sleet
When our bodies meet
I don't care about the weather

Let it snow, let it snow, outside it's cold
But the fire's blazin' so, baby, let it snow
