Alright
This one goes out to all the lovers in the house, knowI'msayin?
I'm gonna express my feelings right about now
On the way I like to do things
T-R, bring it in

Is it good to you - I like it
Is it good to you - Ooh I like it
Is it good to you - I like it
Is it good to you - Ooohooh boy

How would you feel if I worked you down?
Made your head spin like a merry-go-round
Take control like Charles In Charge
I really can't wait, let's stay in the garage
Oops, let me run as I get the whipped cream
Can't have ice cream without whipped cream
Plus an ice cube, to make you swing
My main man did it, eh do the right thing
C'mon let me tickle you in all the right places
Keep my eyes open while I watch ya make faces
Feelin quite dandy, comfortable and cozy
Let me draw the curtains cos my neighbours are nosey
So make a little room, here comes big daddy
Big like a truck, satisfyin like a Caddy
Many will call but the chosen are few
And all I wanna know, is it good to you?

Is it good to you - I like it
Is it good to you - Ooh I like it (Is it good to you)
