If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down
Let me down gently don't pretend
That you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

If you're gonna let me down
Let me down gently don't pretend
