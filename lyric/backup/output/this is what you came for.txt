Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh

You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh

You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
