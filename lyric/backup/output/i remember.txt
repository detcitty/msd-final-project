Krayzie Jackson
I wanna take this time out right now
Yo holla at my dogs
You know what im sayin?
My Bone thug niggas
I ain't holla'd at y'all niggas in a minute on some real
You know what I'm saying?
So what I wanna do right here is dedicate this to yall; my dawgs

Yo!

What up my nigga! Its been a minute since I saw ya
I hear your lawyer still tryin to get that appeal for ya,
Wanted to holla and tell you what's poppin' but you probably
Already know we been going through problems, anyway I
Hear you been exercising and getting strong in tha mind,
I hear you been searching for god inside the Quran,
Thats cool man I been prayed up myself;
I pray for my health and stress way less for wealth now
I'm still a soldier but I'm trying to be one for Johovah,
We in tha last days, and tha last days is almost over,
We all older now our minds much stronger now,
I can see in ya letters your vocabulary's broader now,
I wish we woulda been this smart before we let this game rip us apart
And we forgot that God was our heart,
But don't even sweat it, my nigga stay strong
And we gon' kick it when you come home, my nigga Flesh-N-Bone
