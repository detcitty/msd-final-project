You know life ain't tied with a bow but it's still a gift though
Yeah life ain't felt but it's still good though
It's a blessing just to be here
Everything 1K

I know you're money hungry
Can't wait â€˜cause you ain't eat all day
And you gon' lose your mind if you don't get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon' relate
It's a struggle man, I'm with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I got to thank god for everything
It's a miracle how you'll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K

I woke up in the morning on a cold slab
How the hell I'm in a damn cell
