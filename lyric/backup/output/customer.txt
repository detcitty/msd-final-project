(Intro)
Good morning
Good After noon
Good Evening
Welcome to love, can I take your order?
And you can have it your way

(Verse 1)
Welcome, can I help you?
Take a minute to read the menu
If your lookin for a man
If your lookin for a friend
If your lookin for someone to talk to
Take your time but fill your order
I can appetize you, or main course ya
Caution, caution, cuz your plate is hot(hot)
And I'm the catch of the day (ay ay ay ay ayyy)
You'll desert your meal and your drink (ay ay ay ay ayyy)
You can final order me I'll fill you up for free
If your heart is hungry you can place your order here with me

(Chorus)
Let me serve u up, let me, let me serve u up
See, u can have it your way, ur the customer
If u want it super size with some lovin on the side
Just ask for what u want cuz ur the customer
