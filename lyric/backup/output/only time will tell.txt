You're leaving now
it's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you planned it all along
I see it now
becomes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry eyed
You think that I would have known by now

Now - sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost - like the tears that used to tide
Me over
