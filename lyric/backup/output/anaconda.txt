My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Boy toy named Troy, used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish

Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them push daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill

And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
