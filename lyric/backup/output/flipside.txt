Who, now clap for me mami, oh
Just clap for me mami, just blaze
Okay, and Free, okay, yeah [unverified]
Que tu quieres mujeres, said she blow la-la
Flipside, and she my baby mama
Get wild, okay

Freeway got the hood on smash
Pop in tape, step on gas and get ghost nigga
Freeway got the club on lock, step on stage
Set it down leave with a broad, check for her age

Post up, fans suffer circle the block
Call the cops, it's the Roc' in your area
Post up, distribute to the block
Freeway move the rocks in your area

Yeah, Pop tried to shut me down
Cops tried to shut me down, haters wanna hit me up
What? My glock carry heavy rounds
Mack carry heavy rounds packed in the Chevy truck

What? You better ring the alarm
Before I cock back, dump on you and your boys
And have black suits, tucked on you and your mom
But back to the song, said she wanna suck on me and the boys

Her ass look good in a thong
And she want me to sneak in the building like Trojans in "Troy"
Best believe there's Trojans involved
Hats lift over the boy, oh boy

We rip crowds, whole lot of fire and a little bit of bass
