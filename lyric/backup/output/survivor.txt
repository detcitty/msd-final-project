Ooh, he left me
Didn't even say goodbye
Wrote me a letter
I found it by my bedside

As I read it
Tears swelled up in my eyes
He said, baby, baby

Don't you realize that you're a survivor
You'll work it out
And you'll carry on
You're a survivor, baby
Yeah, you're like a child
As the shades are drawn
As the shades are drawn

He wrote you can handle this life
Me, I'm not that strong
