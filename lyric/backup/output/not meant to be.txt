It's never enough to say I'm sorry
It's never enough to say I care
But I'm caught between what you wanted from me
And knowing if I give that to ya I might just disappear
Nobody wins when everyone's losing

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad, and I, I can't change your mind
It's like trying to turn around on a one way street
