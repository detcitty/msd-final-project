Okay, Coconut Man, Moonheads, and P.
You ready!

Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second

Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high

That you can't even have a good time
Everybody look to the left (yeah)
Everybody look to the right
Can you feel that (yeah)

We'll pay them with love tonight
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
Ain't about the (ha) cha-ching cha-ching
Ain't about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
