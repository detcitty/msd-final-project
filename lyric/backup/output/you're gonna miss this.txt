She was staring out the window, of that, SUV
Complaining saying I can't wait to turn 18
She said I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head, and said I was just like you

You're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
