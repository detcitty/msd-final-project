Why is my baby blue
Can't see the colors
Of a sunny day
Stuck in that point of view
What can I do to take your tears away

I'm not denying
There's a time for crying
Just tell me why you look so sad tonight
I know its crazy
Living in a world these days but
If you take me by the hand

Oh oh oh
There's nothing my love can't fix
For you baby
I'm positive of this
I tell you
Oh oh oh
There's nothing my love can't fix
For you baby

Aw girl
Please look in my caring eyes

I'll take you up so high
You'll start forgetting
You were ever down
Kisses will dry your eyes
This is the way to
