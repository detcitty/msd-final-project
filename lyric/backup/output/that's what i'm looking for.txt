Brat
Hey JD, why you be saying oh, oh
Is that like flossin' shit?
You just like walk in and so people say
"Oh shit, it's him"
Bounce to this, come on

Where my rag wearing soldiers that
Love to watch the dough stack
Never leave the house without their strap
That's what I'm looking for

They know just what a woman need
Keep a big bank roll and a bag of weed
When it's time to go down they ain't scared to freak, shit
That's what I'm looking for

Where my Rolley wearing thugs who
Claim they don't love you
But any time you want something done, they do it
That's what I'm looking for

The ball-all-night type
Frontin', screamin', thug life
That's the type of nigga I like
That's what I'm looking for

I get high, get mine
I like a thug in my life to get by
That's why I spit shine the pussy
'Til it get tight and fine
He push me over to the other side
If he act right he could hit it from behind
We can bump and grind all night 'till we reach a climax
Make sure you leave a phat sack for Brat
Till you come back for more

Six pack surrounding my belly hole, it's tight
You ain't gotta tell me so
So Def is the way that I flow
