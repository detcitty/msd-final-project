Well This heart of mine
Has been hardened like a stone
It might take some time
To get back what is gone

But I'm movin' on
And you don't hold my dreams
Like you did before
Oh, and I will curse your name, hey!

...
Well, I heard the news
That you were back in town
And just passin' through

To claim your lost and found
But I'm over you
