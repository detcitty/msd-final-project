I'm so confused and I think I'm gonna cry tonight
What must I do babe?
You don't know what you mean, oh
Tell me something
Tell me could this really be

You're so unpredictable
Why must you treat me this way
I want you to love me for who I am

Whatever happened to the dream we used to share
Where did our love go
