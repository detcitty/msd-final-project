No flex zone, No flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, No flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal
And a gold bezel
I treat it so special
Now your ho jealous
Freak Hoes, got several
They tens or better
I'm a trendsetter
I'm a go-getter

Swae Lee, Lee Swae, it's the same difference
H2O, Lean, same thing
Nigga's throwing sets saying gangbang
Free everybody in the chaingang
Been two days since I laid down
Kool Moe Dee five the chains on
Versace, them rings on it
Say my fucking name ho
Yea them diamonds so cool
Yea that old school mind fool
Never heard about you
All my hoes they so rude
