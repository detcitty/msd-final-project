Here they come yo, here they come(2x)
This or that, this or that(4x)
Yo!
Who's the Black Sheep, what's the Black Sheep?
Know not who I am, or when I'm coming so you sleep
Wasn't in my room, wasn't in your sphere
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-R-E-S, yes I get suckers start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here one apart
Back, Middle, to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey? (Hey)
Now get a yo! (Yo)
You gotta hay? (Huh)
It's for the hoes (Oh)
The styling is creative, Black Sheep of the Native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the Quest
Deaf retarded uncles, in parties were they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam NOW
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours

You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
