We are not the same I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And they're about to call the wrong attention
And I ain't got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessing
XO niggas ain't nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no we're destined

And everybody around you is so basic
I'm never rocking white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'
And money is the only thing I'm chasin'

And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Give me head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it

Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I did it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
