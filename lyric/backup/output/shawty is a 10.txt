Shawty
Do It
Rock To The Beat For Ya Boy
Radio Killa, Killa, Killa

[Verse 1:]
Shawty fine, Shawty Tight
Shoulda Stayed There All Night
With You (You) With You
I Missed Ya, Picked Ya
Now It's Time I
Get Back up With You(You)Girl With You
Oh Yeah
We Used To Kick Up At The Park
Now She's All Grown Up (up)
Rockin Them Stilettos
Jumpin up Outta That Mercedes Truck (truck)

[Bridge:]
It Was Kiesha
It Was Sonya
It Was Tonya
It Was Monique
It Was Nece
It Was Keke
Now I See You At 23
All I Can Say Is
