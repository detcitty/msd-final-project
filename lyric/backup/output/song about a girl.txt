This ain't about tailgates
Ain't about bonfires
Ain't about souped up cars, water towers
Drowning in a bottle of Jack
This ain't about Chevy's
Ain't about money
Ain't about blue suede shoes, coo-coo-ca-choos
Got nothin' to do with that

It's a song about a girl
It goes like this
Ah, little heartbreak queen
Rockin' the jeans
Baby, just read my lips
It's a song about a girl
The one you can't forget
Ah, blows your mind every time
You think it's gonna be a hit
It's a song about a girl

Ah, it's a song about you, oh, yeah
This ain't about hometowns
