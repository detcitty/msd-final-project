-verse 1-
This is how it started, rather how it all began, 
You see, I was an ugly duckling, only half a man, 
I didn't think I would find a girl, 
The kind that would rock my world, 
So I kept on searchin', always felt the hurtin', 

Temptation got the best of me, 
Temptation said, boy be who you want to be, 
So I started, chargin' by the hour, for my love power,
