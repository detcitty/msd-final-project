Button your lip, baby
Button your coat
Let's go out dancing
Go for the throat
Let's bury the hatchet
Wipe out the past
Make love together
Stay on the path

You're not the only one
With mixed emotions
And you're not the only ship
Adrift on this ocean

This coming and going
Is driving me nuts
This to-ing and fro-ing
