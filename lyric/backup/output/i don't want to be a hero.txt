Oh, send me off to war with a gun in my hand
But I won't pull the trigger
Out destiny is here 'neath the red, white and blue
So lead me to the slaughter

Now don't be afraid, come and join the parade
For the ultimate in sacrifice
It's an old-fashioned story of hope and of glory
A ticket for taking life

I, I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to die for you
