(Down to...)

I thought that there goes my honey, 
My happy shoes, 
Find someone, 
To help me lose these blues.

I'm takin' my body down, 
(To love town! )
(Love love love! )

[Long bridge disco music]

Goin' down... 
Goin' down... 

(Goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss you.

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I didn't miss you.

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
(Down to love town)

I'm goin' down... 
Goin' down... 

(I'm goin' down)
(Down to love town)
(I'm gonna take my body down)
