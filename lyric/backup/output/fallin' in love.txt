Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Baby, baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

I could never see what fate had planned for me
And then, you came and made my days this man's reality
Maybe you can see all the things you've been to me
But my simple fate is at the gate and girl, you've got the key
