The cold wind is blowing and the streets are getting dark
I'm writting you a letter and I don't know where to start
The bells will be ringing Saint John the Divine
I get a little lonely everyday around this time

The music plays all night in Little Italy
The lights will be going up on old Rockafella's tree
People window shoppin' on 5th avenue
All I want for Christmas is you
