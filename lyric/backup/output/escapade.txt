As I was walkin' by, saw you standin' there with a smile
Lookin' shy you caught my eye thought you'd want to hang for a while
Well, I'd like to be with you and you know it's Friday too
I hope you can find the time this weekend to relax and unwind

My mind's tired, I've worked so hard all week
Cashed my check, I'm ready to go
I promise you, I'll show you such a good time

Come on baby, let's get away
Let's save your troubles for another day
Come go with me, we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
Let's go

Escapade, we'll have a good time
