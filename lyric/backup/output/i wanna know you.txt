Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh Whoa oh
Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh Whoa oh
Whoa oh Whoa oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh Whoa oh

When I saw you over there
I didn't mean to stare
But my mind was everywhere

Gonna guess that you're the kind
To say what's on your mind
But you listen when
I have something to show you

There's a mark above your eye
You got it in July
Fighting for your sister's reputation

You remember people's names
And valentines are lame
So I bring you flowers just for no occasion
Oh oh oh

(Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh Whoa oh)
(Whoa oh Whoa oh Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh Whoa oh)
