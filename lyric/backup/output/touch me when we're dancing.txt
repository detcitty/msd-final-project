Play us a song we can slow dance on
We wanna hold each other
Play us a groove so we hardly move
Just let our hearts be together

Oh baby 'cause it feels so good
When we're close like this
Whisper in my ear
And let me steal a kiss

Come on touch me when we're dancing
You know you've got that lovin' touch
Oh touch me when we're dancing
