If i'm not over you
by the time
i get to georgia
then i guess
i'll be alabama bound
there was a time when
i'd do anything for you
but this time, baby
i won't turn around
I always wanted
to get married
and i thought
you were the one
but you never
ever asked me
and i was tired of
hangin' on
you know a girl
can only be let down
so many times
before she runs
and now this
little bitty town's
only got room for
one of us, yeah
You always said
i'd never leave
