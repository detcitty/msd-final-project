umm, yeah!

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Tonight I want to give it all to you
In the darkness
There's so much I want to do
And tonight I want to lay it at your feet
Cause girl, I was made for you
And girl, you were made for me

I was made for lovin' you baby
