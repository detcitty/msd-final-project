What's happening, baby
How the heck are you
My name is Tony
Would you care to dance

No, hey, calm down
Let me get you another Pina Colada
I mean what did we join this
Exclusive disco club for anyway

You know, I mean it costs
A hundred dollars to join
And we're supposed to dance

Don't you like my
White three piece suit
My gold coke spoon
Gold razor blade and
Gold Italian snaggletooth, you know

Come on, please dance with me

I wear tight pants
I always stuff a sock in
It always makes the ladies
Start to talking

My shirt is open
I never use the buttons
Though I look hip
I work for E.F.Hutton

Do you think I'm disco
Cause I spend so much time
Blow drying out my hair

Do you think I'm disco
Cause I know the dance steps
