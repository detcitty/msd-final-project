Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I got a good thing, I ain't gonna give it up
I got a mighty good thing, I ain't gonna give it up

Girl I got, just won't quit now
She won't stop lovin' for just a little bit

She's fine as wine, she's just my kind
That ever so fine, it wanna make me blow my mind

I got a good thing, ain't gonna give it up
I got a mighty good thing, ain't gonna give it up, ha

She knows how to love me when I'm feeling bad
