Day after day, I'm more confused
Yet I look for the light through the pourin' rain
You know that's a game that I hate to loose
And I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame

Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll and drift away
Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n' roll and drift away

Beginnin' to think that I'm wastin' time
