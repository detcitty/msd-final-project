Oh, darling, how strong is
Love supposed to be
Surrounded by fire and magic
We long to be free

Cheating, heating up
Down on the streets of shame
To be strong enough
To fly without love
Like a phoenix from the flame

You've gotta have faith
To work it out, faith and hope
Without a doubt, give us strength
To make a start
Put a song in our heart

Then we're gonna break down the walls
And build the prison with the stone

'Cause you and I know
What love is worth
We're gonna build
A Heaven on Earth

Running in the
Wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
Gonna make love the bottom line
Gonna find peace in our time
