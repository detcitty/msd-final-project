It was on a street so evil,
So bad that even Hell disowned it.
Every single step was trouble
For the fool who stumbled on it.

Eyes within the dark were watching;
I felt the sudden chill of danger.
Something told me, "Keep on walking,"
Told me I should not have gone there.

Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
