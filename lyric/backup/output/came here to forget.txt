Girl getting over him
and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company,
that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar, thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

Keep playing them songs,
keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
