Lucy Liu with my girl, Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
Charlie's Angels, come on

Question, tell me what you think about me?
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave

Question, tell me how you feel about this?
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh and I pay my own bills
Always 50/50 in relationships

The shoe on my feet, I've bought it
The clothes I'm wearing, I've bought it
The rock I'm rockin', I've bought it
'Cause I depend on me

If I wanted the watch you're wearin', I'll buy it
The house I live in, I've bought it
The car I'm driving, I've bought it
I depend on me, I depend on me

All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honey's who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me

All the mommas who profit dollas
