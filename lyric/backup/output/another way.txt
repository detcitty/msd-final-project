Early in the mornin' round 3 a.m.
Lying with a girl named Kim
With a glass of gin, sippin' on it
About to hit the skins
Now I'm all in

Telephone rang, was a girl named Jane
From around the way
How could I forget
Damn, am I caught?
Is it time to quit?
Runnin' through my head

I ain't tryin' to run around no more
Sick and tired of losing track of scores
Every time I turn around, the same old game
Another day
Thinkin' I just wanna settle down
Tired of living foul, it's over now
Said to myself there's gotta be another way, yeah

Later in the day, next case was a girl named Trace
Draped in lace, pink negligee
