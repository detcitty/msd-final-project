Let yo booty do that yoga

Party at the beach down in Copacabana
Sipping Killepitsch, got my black yoga pants on
Me and Brittany, we've been down in Atlanta
Sweating in the club, call me Dirty Diana
Flexing like a yogi, drop it down with your hands up
Do a handstand, bend it back, put your legs up
I ain't got no worries, I'm my own private dancer
My own private dancer

I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, wanna dance all night
I wanna last, wanna last forever
I wanna dance, dance, dance all night

Baby bend over, baby bend over
Baby bend over, let me see you do that yoga
Baby bend over, baby bend over
