The story is told of the
power of gold and it's
lure on the unsuspecting
it glitters and shines
it badgers and binds
and constantly needs protecting
balance the cost of the soul you lost
without dreams your life is sold
are you under the power of gold?
The letters are calls got you
climbing the walls
