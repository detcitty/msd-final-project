*Woman*
Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
Signed with love
forever true

*Man*
Joni was the girl who lived next door
I've known her I guess 10 years or more
Joni wrote me a note one day
And this is what she had to say

*Woman*
Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
