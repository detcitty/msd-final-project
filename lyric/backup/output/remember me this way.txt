Every now and then we find a special friend
Who never lets us down
Who understands it all, reaches out each time you fall
You're the best friend that I've found

I know you can't stay, a part of you will never ever go away
Your heart will stay
I'll make a wish for you and hope it will come true
That life would just be kind to such a gentle mind

If you lose your way
