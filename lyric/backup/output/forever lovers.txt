Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends

They checked into a small hotel
She blushed when he asked
For the bridal suite

Was the beginning of their lives together
Anxiously they'd waited for the moment
That their love would be complete

She reached inside
Her brand new traveling bag
And found her brand new negligee
And then she shyly slipped it on
