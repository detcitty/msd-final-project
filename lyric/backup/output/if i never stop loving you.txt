(Donny Kees/Skip Ewing)

If there ever was a perfect night,
This just might be the one.
For telling you the way i feel
And just how real we've become
If i'm anxious and a little uptight
It's because i wanna ask you this right

If i never stop loving you
Will you never start wanting me to?
Say you won't and that's what i'll do
