I've told you almost ev'ry bedtime story
And you've heard almost ev'ry nursery rhyme
So, tonight before you go to sleep
And pray the Lord your soul to keep
Here's mommy's favorite story one more time.

Once upon a time there was a castle
And in this castle lived a King and Queen
And it came to pass, they were both were blessed
By one little blue-eyed princess
