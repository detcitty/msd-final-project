The perfect storm is Twista and Chris Brown ya dig
I got a new one for ya
Lets make a movie baby

Twista got cars
Big swagger
I'm a rock star like Mick Jagger
And I got bars that I spit faster
You a hot star no bitch badder
So let me take you on a ride
On a journey with the one that you call daddy
Who gon make you get it wet
But this time we gon do something romantic and different
I'll tell you about it when we get on the movie set

I was thinking that we could just make a sex tape
Plus I think yo face cute when its a HD
Maybe I could tape you and you could tape me
When I pull my h2 up to your h3
You know that you want to be in this movie
So dont be acting like a trippin with a stranger mission
Recording you while you lovin me down below
