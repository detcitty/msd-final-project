I'm not gonna lay around and whine and moan
'cause somebody done, done me wrong
Don't think for a minute that I'm gonna sit around
And sing some old sad song
I believe it's half full, not a half empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last

I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
