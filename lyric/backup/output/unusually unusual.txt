She's unusually unusual!

She introduced herself as Amy, said call me Caroline for short
She said, I just moved in three doors down
so I wouldn't be the girl next door
And I knew the shoes she wasn't wearing fit her just right
And she said "Hey, man did you know that somebody
left your grass out in the yard all last night?"

Chorus
She's unusually unusual
