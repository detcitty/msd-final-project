Always be around

Don't you know I can see what you're doing?
Runnin' around with your cheap talk, cheap talk, yeah
What I need is a man who can do me right
Do me right

If you've got what I need I can guarantee
To return all the love that you've given to me
But I've got to be sure that you'll always will be around
Always be around, aww, yeah
