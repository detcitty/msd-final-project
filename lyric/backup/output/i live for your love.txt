Stand up, stand on your own
That's what they tell me
You can make it alone

Where does it say I have to move
Far away from you
To prove I'm strong?

Oh, when all it really proves
Is I'm lonely without you
And loneliness has to be wrong

I live for your love
(Everyday)
Every minute
I live for your love
(In my life)
Want you in it
I live for your love
I admit it
I live for your love
