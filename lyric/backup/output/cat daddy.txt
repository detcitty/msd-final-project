Check this out baby girl, I want you to check out a nigga,
Cattttt Dadddyyyyy!

Man I go to work, true winner
Jeans skinny, like Squidward
Lookin for your girl, just missed her
Did my cat daddy and I took her down, timber
When its cold, mamma calls it winter
Switch the feeling niggers, daddy calls it dimmer
Baby got ass chelsea calls its thinnest, UPS checks get it we deliver
Cat daddy when I dougie, cat daddy when I member
(when I member) Backwards skinnys, they for rejects only
I remember
Competition see decrease, they surrender
Smokin' Wyclef kush
Now I'm gone till november
Move your arms like your wheel chair stunt'n
Drop low grab your shoulder like you fuckin
Tell Power 106 to bang this shit
Big up to my bro Sam, he the king of this shit

Call me SpongeBob
Stackin Krabby Patties
