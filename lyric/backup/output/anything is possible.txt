Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
Anything is possible
Just put your mind to it
Anything is possible
If you put your mind to it
Anything...
Is possible

VERSE 1:
Thought I couldn't slow him down
Long enough to look my way
Thought he was out of my league
Wouldn't give me time of day
Thought he was like all the rest
Love her, leave her, no remorse
But I guess that I misjudged
And this thing just ran its course
He taught me

CHORUS:
