I was walkin' down the street
Concentratin' on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked round in a state of fright
I saw four faces, one mad.
A brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit,
And turned to each other

I say
I don't like cricket (Oh no!)
I love it
I don't like cricket (No no!)
I love it
Don't you walk thru' my words,
You got to show some respect.
Don't you walk thru' my words,
