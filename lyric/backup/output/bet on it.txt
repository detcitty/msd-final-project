Everybody's always
talkin' at me
Everybody's tryin' to get
in my head

I wanna listen to my
own heart talkin'
I need to count on
myself instead
(Did you ever)
Lose yourself to get

what you want

(Did you ever)
Get on a ride and
wanna get off
(Did you ever)

Push away the ones
you should've held close
Did you ever let go
Did you ever not know

I'm not gonna stop
that's who I am
I'll give it all I got
that is my plan

Will I find what I
lost
You know you can
Bet on it
Bet on it

Bet on it

Bet on it
Bet on me
I want to make it
right
that is the way
to turn my life around
today is the day
