I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass, it's Saturday
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
System on blast, cops just pass
Just seen a big ol' ass, it's Saturday
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky

Grease don't pop on the stove no more, moved on up
double shot Hennesey fill my cup
Luda choke smoke in a big black truck
Should I wild out, WHAT THE FUCK?!
Act like my rims ain't clean
How you gonna act like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like aftro-sheen
but they don't never really wanna pop them thangs
Cane, cane sugar man Luda don't go
and I stop at a light, pull off so slow
but I'm out for the night, so pass that dro
So, daddy come home in a Cadillac brome, cadillac brome
Now don't it sound absurd
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
Trick car alarms, then bend them curves
