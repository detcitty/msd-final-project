Cause you're the outside woman
Don't feel bad, don't cry

I lay next to another woman
But I call out your name
(Calling, calling, calling)
(Your name) yeah, babe

And I really want
To see you right now
But right now I can't
Change a thing
(Can't change a thing)
(Can't change a thing)

But just remember
Girl, I love you
And as soon as I can
I'll break away
And see you, baby
(Don't feel bad)
