Yeah, Ha ha ha ha ha
I think I see where you're goin' with this one E

Hey, hey, been around the world and back, yeah I did that
Still kick raps in cars and packs, so where's my kids at?
And everybody hatin' sounded funnier than Sinbad
I'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth ?
We the ass wholes that she warned you about
We just storm in your house open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of styles, just be sure that it's wild
6:30 in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down
Twin sisters gettin' wasted so they both are down
It's goin' down, I thought I told you man
If you tryna to party let me see you raise your hand

There's a party on 5th ave, hit me if you tryna go
I can be there in like 20
