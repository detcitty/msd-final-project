Temptations -laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalaaala la la
Richard- So you're through with love
Any you say
It's just a waste of time
Temptations- waste of time you blew my mind
Richard- There are two sides to love
And if you will
I'd like to show you mine
Girl love has it's ups and downs
sometimes like a merry go round, going round and around and around and around
Never knowing where you're bound
