1, 2, ooh yeah
Oo-ooh, yeah
Oo-ooh, yeah

Hey, hey
Did you ever think there might be another way
To just feel better, baby, just feel better about today
Oh no, if you never wanna have to turn and go away
Babe, you might feel better, might feel better if you stay

Yeah, yeah
I bet you haven't heard a word I've said
And yeah, yeah
If you've had enough of all your tryin'
Just give up the state of mind you're in

If you wanna be somebody else
If you're tired of fighting battles, baby, with yourself
If you wanna be somebody else
Change your mind, yeah
