I used to go out to parties, and stand around
'Cause I was too nervous, to really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor, somebody could choose me

No more standin' there beside the walls
Finally got myself together, baby, and I'm havin' a ball
Long as you're groovin', there's always a chance
Somebody watchin' might wanna make romance
