Woo!
I'm on my way to an island
And I'm popping shit at the pilot (fly shit only)
Niggas be broke and still shopping
But still talking shit like they violent (niggas is broke)
They said they honest, talk money
These niggas gonna say that they got it
Get it now boy, the key to success
And these niggas gon' blame it on Khaled
They don't want to see you win (they don't)
They don't want to see the Wraith (no)
You don't want to see your bitch caught up in the stars
Like she's outer space
Mansion at the condo, condo at the mansion and I'm running out of space
K.O. on me, keep 'em coming out his mouth, I'm sending somethin' round his way
Niggas barely getting lawyer money
Better get some 6 oil money
Running around like you're superman
Don't be selfish, get your mom insurance money (hah!)
Cause I'm the one to put it on your money
I'm the one that make it happen it to you
Niggas with you fuck around and do it for me

Hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out the piff and the tropic, it's litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
Pourin' the fours on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't want to see the squad
They don't want to see the Wraith
They don't want to see your bitch up in the stars like she going outer space
Litty again, litty again
I got it we litty again
Litty again, ltty again
I got it, we did it, we litty again
