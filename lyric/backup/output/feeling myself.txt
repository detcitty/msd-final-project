Yo, B
They ready?
Let's go!

Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my

I'm with some hood girls lookin' back at it
And a good girl in my tax bracket
Got a black card that'll let Saks have it
These Chanel bags is a bad habit

I-I do balls, Dal Mavericks
My Maybach, black matted
Bitch, never left but I'm back at it
And I'm feelin' myself, jack rabbit

Feelin' myself, back off
'Cause I'm feelin' myself, jack off
He be thinking about me when he whacks off
Wax on? (Wax off)

National anthem, hats off
Then I curve that nigga, like a bad toss
Lemme get a number two, with some Mac sauce
"On The Run Tour" With my mask off

I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
