Oooooooooh-oh-oooooooooh

I'll keep working my way back to you, babe
With a burning love inside
Hey, I'm working my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died

I let it get away
Do-do, do-da, do
(Been paying every day)
Do-do, do-da, do

When you were so in love with me
I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too
But how I cried over losing you

See, I'm down and out
But I ain't about to go living my life without you
Hey, every day
I made you cry
I'll pay and, girl
'Til the day I die
