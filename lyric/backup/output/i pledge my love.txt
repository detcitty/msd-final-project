Always together, together forever
Always together forever
I will love you
till the day I die
I know this now and my love won't run dry
You came along my life has begun
Two hearts are now beating as though they were one
Like the stars that make the night so bright
You shine on me with a love that's so right
A love that is lasting
A love that's so pure
Each time I feel it
It makes me more sure
Like a flower in a fairy tale I blossomed out
From a source that won't fall, love that is lasting
