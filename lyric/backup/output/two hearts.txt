Came into my life, a stranger
You captured my heart
Now I've got to face the danger
I'm ready to start

Thought that I could make it on my own, all alone
I've tried so hard to fake it
Now the truth must be known

Two hearts are always better
Together forever
Two hearts are always better
True romance we'll treasure

You've given me so much of yourself
Till I don't need nobody else
And with each passing day
My love for you grows strong in every way
