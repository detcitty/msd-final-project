I want it all I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming
With no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say
Gotta find me a future move out of my way
I want it all
I want it all

I want it all and I want it now
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all and I want it now
