I can't hear a single word
Just know you're talking â€˜cause your lips keep moving
Everything I thought I learned
Goes out the window
All I want is one thing

You can promise castles, treasures, babies
I don't care
Cause for now you're just enough for me
I want you near
Like a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck
You remember what I love so baby take me back

Turn the lights down low and kiss me in the dark
Cause when you're touching me baby I see sparks
