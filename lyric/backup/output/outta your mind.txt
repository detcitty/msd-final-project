Yeah, everybody in the club right now
(What's up?)
If you standing around
(What?)
You need to get the fuck up out of here
(Get out!)
'Cause when we get come in the club
(What's up?)
We like to get fucking crazy
(Crazy!)
You know what? Let's fucking lose it!

Get outta your mind, get outta your mind
Get outta your mind, what? Fuck that shit, get outta your mind
Get outta your mind, get outta your mind
Get outta your mind, what? Fuck that shit, get outta your mind

I'm a semi-truck, no fucking brakes
Outta control like a bull at the gates
Get drunk or get the fuck out the way
We get bananas like a room full of apes

I done lost it, you flossin'
I'm over here with my niggas in the mosh pit
Throwin' elbows, steppin' Sheryl toes
Is that nigga dead? Who the fuck knows?

Shake them dreads like a motherfucking Rasta
