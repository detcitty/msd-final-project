Leaving home, out on the road
I've been down before
Riding along on this big old jet plane
I've been thinking about my home
But my love light seems so far away
And I feel like it's all been done
Somebody's trying to make me stay
You know I got to be moving on

Oh, big ol' jet airliner
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay

Goodbye to all my friends at home
