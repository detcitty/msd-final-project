First, you take my heart
In the palm of your hands
And you squeeze it
Then you take my mind
And play with it all night

You take my pride and you
Throw it up against the wall
You take me in your arms, baby
And bounce me like a rubber ball

I'm not complaining
What you're doing, you see
Cause this hurting feeling
Is, ooh, so good to me

Don't you know that it
Hurts so good
Don't you know that it
Hurts so good
