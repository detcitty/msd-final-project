I don't know too much but I know love the way I've been touched
It's your love that heats me up
And there's no such thing as too much

'Cause I don't know any better
No, I don't know when it's time to stop, no

All night you give me what I like
Intense, high explosive dynamite
Pure dynamite

All night you supply the spark I like
Intense, heavy dose of dynamite
Pure dynamite

Wild things can't be tamed under my skin and it's just the same
I'm wading, ignited
And there's no way I'll ever fight it

'Cause I don't know any better
No, no I don't know when it's time, time for me to stop, no, no

All night you give me what I like
Intense, high explosive dynamite
Pure dynamite
