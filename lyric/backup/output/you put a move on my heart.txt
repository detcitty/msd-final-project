Baby I just want you to understand

Just exactly how you make me feel

Oooh yeah

I wanna feel you next to me

Ooooh... time after time, when I'm feelin low

Somethin inside of me let's me know it's alright

Loves on my side

When the world... seems a lonely place

I've got a dream that won't leave a trace of the blues

I just think of you baby I know

I've got a real thing here by my side

Someone who needs me holding me tight
