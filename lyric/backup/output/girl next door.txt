If I would've knew the girl next door, would've been you
I would've been nice to you, a little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you

If I would've knew the girl next door, would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub, depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

Girl I'm so surprised to see
The young, fine woman that you grew up to be
Your body's banging like a 400 SE
Even your attitude flows pleasantly

I remember when you was just Tonya Hall
A girl that likes to play basketball
As far as I was concern, you were one of my boys
I never cared about my sex or yours but

If I would've knew the girl next door, would've been you
I would've been nice to you, a little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
