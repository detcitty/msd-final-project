Lately, I? ve been tryna fight whatever? s pulling us under
It? s got a hold and really making me wonder
What it takes to get through, I gotta stick with you, my baby

Baby tell me, maybe I? m foolishly overreacting
But being without you I can? t imagine
It? s just too close to the heart
And I won? t stand it, if we're broken apart

Do you hear me?
Baby ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don? t you throw in the towel
I? m keeping my promise to you, I got ya back now

When the chips are down
And it seems like it? s so hard for you to move ahead
