It's going down around town what? Likwit Likwit 'No Doubt'
'Knock 'Em Out The Box' Slick Rick 'Children's Story'
Don't underestimate the reach
Here comes that city brother who lives by the beach
Defari, work for Likwit organize
Dodger hats and snowboard shades
Camouflage my eyes, hustle to survive
The Less mican man stands grand
And work with two twenty five
This here's the second smash
The album, the third
The trilogy will be heard from Toronto to Pittsburgh
Yo Ev, do we got retail in Afghanistan
(Man I don't know but I know we got Japan)
Uh ha, word up we all over the states man
Doin' this for the MC's and the DJ's
The vertebrae without the B-boys
Hip hop wouldn't be here to this very day
And that's my word, we tryin' to blow like the Hiddenburg
Swerve legalize dope in the form of vinyl
This ain't the final or the last blast kid
