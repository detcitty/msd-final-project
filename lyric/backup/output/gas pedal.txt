Holy shit!

Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick, I wanna smash 'em all, now
Speed up, gas pedal , now
(You already know me, S-A-G-E)
Speed up, gas pedal (Look, ah)

Black money, let them ho's say amen
I'm just tryna make it clear boy Ray-Bans
I'm a great man, whoa, say it friend
I play a whole late night DJ amen
Room full of boppers, tell them give me topper
Beat it, beat it up, now no one hit the coppers
I'm S-A-G-E, who would like to know?
Fe-fi-fo-fum, large me in yo throat
West-side, baby, do what you do
And you gotta tell what that shit do
It's, pretty nigga mobbing, just the way that I grew
I'd be steppin' up in the club, then make 'em drop to my shoe
And you mad cause I spoon, but I don't give a fork
