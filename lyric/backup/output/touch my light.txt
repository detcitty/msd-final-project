Ooh, yeah
Li-da-di-da-di-da-di-da

Sometimes it's so hard to see
The things that we dread so much come about so easily
And in my distress I often pray
Whoa, Jah Jah, please, when will things start to come my way

You know that better days will come
Seems like it's been so long
We seem to forget so easily
Love needs its share of energy

Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light
Come on closer to me, girl
