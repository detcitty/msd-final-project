Please help me 'cause I'm breaking down, this pictures frozen and I can't get out
Please help me 'cause I'm breaking down, this pictures frozen and I can't get out of here
Believe me, I'm just as lost as you

an every time I think I've finally made it
I learn I'm farther away than I have ever been before
I see the clock and its ticking away, and the hourglass empty
What the F*** do I have to say
