I spend my time
Thinkin' 'bout you constantly
It's true that I want you
You're the meaning of success to me
Cause anything you want
You can get from me
Don't try to work it out
Just let it be
Emotion has no price
And love is free
I've been going round in circles
You're always on my mind
I need you so bad
It's driving me out of my mind
Reflected in your eyes
Can't you see
You and I against the world
