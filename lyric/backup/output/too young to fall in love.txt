You say our love
Is like dynamite
Open your eyes
It's like fire and ice
Well you're killing me
Your love's a guillotine
Why don't you just set me free

Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love

I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
