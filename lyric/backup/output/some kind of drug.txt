Wake up this morning I'm shaking I can't be still girl
too many images running through my mind
as soon as I hit it I kick it out of my system
even my brother he ask me "What you on?"
I'm on some kinda drug
can't explain
all the ways you get me high
I'm on some kinda drug
can't explain
don't keep me waiting all night
girl come through
and that's why I'm running
fire be brurning in my hotel room
come through
campaign be poppin'
system be knocking in my hotel room
yeah uh

Ever since I met you, you got me changing my schedule
If you ain't know, that shits eventful
