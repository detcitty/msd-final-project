Baby, you've got a sexy body
I think I ought to tell you so
You look so deep and se delicious
I kiss you from your head to toe

If there's a chance I could romance you
I'd make you scream in sheer delight
I'd give you so much love and pleasure
You'd want to make love every night

You know I could
[Ooh, ooh, ooh, wrap my arms around you]
You know I would
[Ooh, ooh, ooh, squeeze and hold your body tight]

I'll tell the world
[Ooh, ooh, ooh, I'm so glad I found you]
Don't you know, baby
[Ooh, ooh, ooh, now tonight's the night for love]

I'm gonna give my all to you
[Wild and crazy love]
I'm gonna have a ball with you
[Wild and crazy love]

I'm gonna give my all to you
[Wild and crazy love]
I'm gonna give it to you, give it to you, give it you, give it to you, baby]
[Wild and crazy love]

Baby, there's no one who can move me
