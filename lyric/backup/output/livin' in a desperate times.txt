Never thought it would be so rough
And I wonder if I have enough
To keep from breaking down
No mercy in this town

Every day is just another test
Seems I'm always second best
But you learn along the way
That's the price you have to pay

I try to stay defiant
Be tough and self-reliant
Though I get tired to the bone
Love is just a wish you keep inside
How's it gonna help me to survive?
Looks like I'm in this fight alone

And I'm livin' in desperate times
Being alive's my only crime
