Girl, I've been waitin' on this day
Better thought you never hear me say
You been creeping around, all over town
Been laying it down, been messin' around
What goes around, always comes around
Baby girl, I thought we was down

Girl, I hope you change your freaky ways
'Cause I really wanna stay
Tell me is he the best since I been there
That I should share your underwear
Do you really think he cares

All this time I been sleeping with you
You been sleeping with me
You been stroking him and loving him
And kissing him and hugging him

Oh, why you been creeping with him
He's been sexing your friends
And I got you thinking about it
Thinking about it, thinking about it
Thinking about it

Girl, I think that I should let you know
That I'm gonna have to up and go
