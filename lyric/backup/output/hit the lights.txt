Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights

Baby hold it,
and let me holla at you baby for a moment
And if you with it, I'm with it, keep it rollin'
And we'll be dancing and drinking until the morning
Until the morning

Starters going off
It's so hot there's girls just taking all there clothes off
So take a picture of this moment with your iPhone
Cause I don't wanna forget tonight, night, night, night

Put your lighters in the air
Let em burn into the night
And let everybody know
that your with it and your ready to go

So hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Tonight, tonight

So Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the light
hit the light
Hit the lights
