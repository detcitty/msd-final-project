Well he used to be mine
Not so very long ago
I was crazy to ever let him get away
But girl you should know better
Then to go braggin' in my face
So forgive me, for what I'm 'bout to say

Big deal, so what, who cares
You just got lucky
That's all, it was, shut up
Don't want to hear another word about
Candlelight and long-stem roses
And how you're fallin' head-over-heels
In love, so what, big deal
