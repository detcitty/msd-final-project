You, you are the one, you're all I've been thinking about
And I, I'd give it all away if only you were here beside me
For one moment you're so close, I can feel you breathe
For one moment, now you're all I know that I need

Just when I thought you were there to depend on
Don't you know that I've tried everything I know to do
I would lie or die for you
I just want to know why, 'cause
