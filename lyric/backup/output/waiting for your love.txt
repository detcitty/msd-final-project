Hands, don't let her go, 'cause then the midnight icy winds will blow
Eyes, give every drop, this ain't the way that should have made her stop
Arms, just let her know, no one fills the place she used to go
Smile, don't leave me now, 'cause you're the reason she's here anyhow
Words be gentle when you speak into her heart
'Cause if it breaks, she may not come again
