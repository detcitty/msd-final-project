Everybody's talking to computers,
they're all dancing to a drum machine
I know I'm living on the outside
Scared of getting caught between
I'm so cool calculated alone in a modern world-uh huh

But Sally has a hard time holding back
The alley to her heart is a beaten track
She's got the love monkey riding on her back

You want love I got it, come on girl

CHORUS:
