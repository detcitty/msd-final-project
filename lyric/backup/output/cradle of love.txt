Well rock the cradle of love
Rock the cradle of love
Yes the cradle of love don't rock easily It's true
Well rock the cradle of love
I rocked the cradle of love
Yes the cradle of love don't rock easily It's true
Well now
It burned like a ball of fire
When the rebel took a little child bride
To tease yeah so go easy yeah

Cause love cutts a million ways
Shakes the devil when he missbehaves
I ain't nobody's fool
Come on shake it up
Whatever I do

Rock the cradle of love
Rock the cradle of love
Yes the cradle of love don't rock easily It's true
