I just can't believe this man
This is another night of these thoughts
Can't get this outta my head, yeah

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cuz my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show

Oh baby, I don't wanna know
