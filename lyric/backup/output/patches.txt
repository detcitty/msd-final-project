(Spoken:)
I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it 'Course deep down inside
He was hurt 'cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
He said "Patches, I'm depending on you son,
To pull the family through,
