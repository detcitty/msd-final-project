So much for my happy ending
(Oh, oh)

So much for my happy ending
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

Lets talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything
That I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be
But we lost it
All of our memories so close to me
