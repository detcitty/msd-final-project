Let's kick it ese

Comin' out da slums
It's da hoodlums
I'm pullin' my gatt out on all you bums
So bring it on when you wanna come fight this
Outlaw, kick ya like Billy Ray Cypress
Hill
Kill
I'll bust that grill
Grab my gatt, and load up the steel
And if you wanna get drastic
I'll pull out my plastic
Glock automatic
Synthetic material, bury your blocks 'n' mortar
Headed down to da Mexican border
Smokin' that smelly
Northern Cali'
Gonna put a slug in Captain O'Malley
Ho, hum
Hear the gatt come
Boooooommmmmm!
Let me see what you'll do
It's a sin to kill a man
But I'll be damned if I don't take a stand

We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out
We ain't goin' out like that
We ain't goin' out like that
