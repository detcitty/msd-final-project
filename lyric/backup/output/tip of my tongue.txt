You somehow knew we'd meet again
Now I understand
If I look surprised don't be alarmed
I've got you, in my arms

I can almost taste it, and when I can
I won't waste the chance
Just a lick away
Oh, so close
And baby there's one thing I know

My heart speaks but the words play
On the tip of my tongue
And no matter what my lips say
