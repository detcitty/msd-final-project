The Midas touch, touch, touch, touch

You say you? re going through changes
Every day it seems your life is up and down
And you say that you? re lookin? for an answer
Everywhere you look it seems you can? t be found

Like searchin?, tryin? to find the rainbow
No one? s ever found it, yet it? s told to be
But if you? re lookin? for a lover
Everything you need, you can find right here with me

I? ve got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I? ve got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Now you? ve been trapped by love
Someone takes your heart and then says goodbye
So you say that you? ll never love another
Tired of playin? games and that? s the reason why

But now whenever we? re together
