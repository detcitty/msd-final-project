Doin' well dog
Yeah, me and all my
Yeah, me
Yeah

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself dog

Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here dog

How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
