(Shoes, you keep walking up to her door)
(Shoes, you wanna go back for more)

Shoes, now we've been here before
Every time I put you on my feet
You keep walking up to her door

You been turned out in the rain
She puts you out in the cold
You been treated so bad
I think you got a hole in your sole

Now watch yourself, shoes
You've worn out your welcome there
