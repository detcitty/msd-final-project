Electric lights
Blow my mind
But I feel alright

And never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

You catch my eye
Bitch you wanna fly
I'm so alive

And never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
