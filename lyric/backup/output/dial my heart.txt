When I think about you, baby
I want you here
I wanna put my arms around you
And feel you, dear

You have touched my heart
I'm so in love
You're the only girl
I'm thinking of, ooh

[CHORUS]
I call my baby on the phone
Got to leave a message
Just to let her know
That if she ever feels alone
To dial my heart
And if by chance
You're not at home
You can reach me, baby
By the nearest pay phone
I gotta cross my fingers
And pray you'll know
