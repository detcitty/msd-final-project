Ya git up
ya git down
Ya git lost
And then ya get found

Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Ya git a laugh
Ya git a cry
Get 'em all before you die

Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

Come on, sit down, git down
A-come on, sit down, git down

Sure as I'm sittin' here
Sure as I'm sittin' here

All the ladies
(Fine ladies)
Hypnotize you
And all your friends
Well, they just patronize you

Don't gotta look for God
He's just sittin' here
And I think He's got a plan
