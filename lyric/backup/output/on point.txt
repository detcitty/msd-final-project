I'm sick, demented, I came unrepresented
I rose from the grave, I had a close shave
The cops tried to lock me down
'Cause the Glock they found
Was stolen that's how I'm rollin'

Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
So I don't like Marky or the monarchy
Don't start me up like a Rollin' Stone
I leave you sulkin' like Macaulay Culkin
In 'Home Alone'

So 'Get A Grip' like Stephen Tyler
I used to trip with the Divine Styler
Back in the days there were Irish ways
And Irish laws to stand up for the cause

When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man

When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man

When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man
