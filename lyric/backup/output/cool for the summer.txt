Tell me what you want, what you like, it's okay
I'm a little curious too
Tell me if it's wrong, if it's right, I don't care
I can keep a secret, can you?

Got my mind on your body and your body on my mind
Got a taste for the cherry, I just need to take a bite

Don't tell your mother, kiss one another
Die for each other, we're cool for the summer

Take me down into your paradise
Don't be scared, 'cause I'm your body type
