I was your hero, strong and fearless in your eyes
You were softer than the summer sky
Young lovers we were so unwise

But time is a teacher and this time I've hurt you so
Left you crying but don't you let go
There's so much the years have left to show

Don't count the rainy days
They blow hard and then they're gone
Don't throw our love away, away, away
