When I'm with you, I shake inside
My heart's all tangled up
My tongue is tied
It's crazy
Can't walk; can't talk
Can't eat; can't sleep
Oh I'm in love
Oh I'm in deep
'Cause baby

With a kiss you can strip me defenseless
With a touch I completely lose control
All that's left of my strength is a memory
Whoa...

I get weak when I look at you
