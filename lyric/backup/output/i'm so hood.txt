DJ Khaled
We the best
Who
We nigga
We the best
This the remix
The I'm so hood remix
I'm making movies

I'm so Hood
Remix
Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist (we always gonna be the best)
And I never dance when I'm in this place
Because you and your man is planning to hate (I run this man)
I'm so hood
And I got these gold up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house
Then you'll know what I'm talking about (I make hit records this is what I do)
(I'm of the) hood (This the remix)
And if you feel me put your hands up Hood (put em up, put em up, put em up)
My hood niggas can you feel me (I gave you we taking over)
I'm so hood
And It you're not from here you can walk it out
And you not Hood if you don't know what I'm talking about
I'm so Hood (hey young jeezy)
(you got me we run this man we run this)

I'm so h to the double-o d
Got all this god damn money on me
Pockets so fat it don't make no sense
Whips so clean don't need no tints
Watch so bright I don't need no light
And no where word don't need no mic
Niggas like Young what you get for show?
Tell em same shit I used to get for the blow
Send 'em on the road nigga what I got to lose
Put em in the vans i ain't talkin' about the shoes
Do the speed limit nigga watch out for the lights
Pussy ass niggas gotta watch out for the dikes
Seventeen five yeah nigga I said it
Seventeen five yeah nigga yeah I meant it
And when we do it bad and when we do it good
I'm so I'm so I'm so mother fucking hood

Everybody come equipped with bangas
Throwing up our middle fangas
And you know I don't slip so I gotta keep 10 in the clip and 1 the chambers
Better be walking with angels
And never take candy from strangers
Luda's dressed in stripes had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals
I'm in the zone homes going for the two point conversion
I'm so hood that Ludacris should have been on the original version
But this is the remix
With the cheap tricks
Hitting sweet licks
And I cut the braids off with the waves and the fade that will make you sea sick
See this is the way that we ball
And this is the way we roll
So put a fist in the air if you care
United we stand and divided we fall
When the south is in the house you better watch your mouth
