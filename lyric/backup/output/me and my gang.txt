Way on down to southern Alabama
With the guitars jammin' that's where we're headed
Straight up to Butte, Montana
Singin' "Lord, I Was Born a Ramblin' Man"
California to Oregon
Even New York City got one or two hill billies
Ready to hit the road
It's a brother and a sister kind of thang
Raise up your hands if you all wanna hang
With me and my gang
We live to ride, we ride to live
