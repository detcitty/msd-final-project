(Pam Sawyer, Marilyn McLeod)

Darling, when you're next to me
I melt, I feel so weak
It's getting hard to go to sleep
This feeling on my mind
It needs you, baby, to satisfy

You can't turn me off
Not in the middle of turning me on
I can't suddenly stop now
You changed me from cold to hot
Ooh, now I'm ready to give you
All the love I've got
Please, don't leave me now
Can't you read in my eyes?
This need I have to love

So don't tease me now
(Don't tease me)
Please, please me now
You can't turn me off, no
Not in the middle of turning me on
(In the middle, in the middle)
I can't suddenly stop now
Each and every time we touch
Ooh, this feeling too much
Take me to that special place
You've gone too far
