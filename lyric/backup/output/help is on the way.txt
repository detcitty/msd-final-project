Why are you in so such hurry?
Is it really worth the worry?
Look around, then slow down

What's it like inside the bubble?
Does your head ever give you trouble?
It's no sin, trade it in

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
"Hang on", a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man
