Baby grind on me
Relax your mind take your time on me
I love you deeper if you cry for me
Now come and kiss me till yo body gets weak
Just grind on me baby
Grind on me
Relax your mind take your time on me
I love you deeper if you cry for me
Now come and kiss me till yo body gets weak
Just grind on me baby

When I grind I make'em say (ahh)
Slow grind be my day (job)
I grind in the back of my (car)
Keep it movin like a see (saw)
I make'em laugh and giggle
Cuddle a little
Kiss on ya neck
Like girl let me see that thing jiggle
Girlfriend your body's so raw
I could tell you a superstar
B.l.u.e.s.t.a.r.
I could tell around the block how sexy you are
I drink red bull so I keep stamina
What's my name
What's my name
What's my name
Prettie rickie pretty boy
Doing pretty good thangs
Makng pretty good change
Getting pretty good
From these pretty pretty chicks

Getting pretty damn rich

Prettie rickie rickie rickie and the maverix
