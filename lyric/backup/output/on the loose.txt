One day you feel quite stable
The next you're coming off the wall
But I think that you should warn me
If you start heading for a fall
I see the problem start
I watch the tension grow
I see you keeping it to yourself
And then instead of reaching conclusions
I see you reaching for something else

No one can stop you now
Tonight you're on the loose
No one to tell you how
Tonight you're on the loose

No one can stop you now
Tonight you're on the loose
