There's something that I want to say
But words sometimes get in the way
I just want to show my feelings for you
There's nothing that I'd rather do than spend every moment with you
I guess you should know I love you so
You are my lady
You're everything I need and more
You are my lady

You're all I'm living for
There's no way that I can resist your precious kiss
Girl you've got me so hypnotized
Just say that you'll stay with me
(you'll stay)

'Cause our love was meant to be
I promise to love you more each day
