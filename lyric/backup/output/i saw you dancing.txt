The Album is called "Pride"

I saw you dancing,
And I'll never be the same again, for sure;
I saw you dancing;
Say Yaki-Da, my love.
I saw you dancing,
And I'll never be the same again, for sure;
I saw you dancing;
Say Yaki-Da.

I'm waiting for a chance,
To get to know you;
To ask for a dance,
Just look into my eyes,
