He sat up on the bed and he watched me packing
He already knew why I was leavin'
I took what I needed but I sure left a lot still hanging
But I figured I'd get it come the weekend
He said Daddy when you get there
Are you gonna have a refridgerator
I kinda laughed and said I guess I will
Then he handed me a tracing of his hand
On the back of a piece of paper
And a magnet and my heart stood still (when he said)

Put your hand in mine
