I don't know what this world's gonna do
But I know one thing that this is the life for me
Baby cause I'm a thug
All day every day
Baby cause I'm a thug
Wouldn't change for the world
Uh huh cause I'm a thug
That's right you heard
Baby cause I'm a thug
Uh huh oh yeah

(Check it out)
Could it be my baggy jeans
Or my gold teeth
That make me different from ya'll
Ain't trippin dog
But listen dog
I've been raised a little different dog
I'm just doing my thang
These are my ghetto slangs
And I'm representing thug shit
This who I roll with
Watch them niggas that's gonna love this
Niggas who out on bond
On the run
Got 10 years on parole
Since you can't say it dog I'ma say it for ya'll
Motherfuck the po-po's
Fuck the judge and ceo's
Fuck the da and po's
Fuck the family of the victim
Witness that's snitchin ass hoes nigga

I don't know what this world's gonna do
But I know one thing that this is the life for me
