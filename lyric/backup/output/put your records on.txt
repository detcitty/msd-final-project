Three little birds, sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete.
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same.
Ooh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
