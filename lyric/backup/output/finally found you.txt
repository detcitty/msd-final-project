Sube la botella al aire
Se armo la dura en esta

Come on!

You know I'm gon get ya, yeah,
Whatever it takes, get there,
No, I won't drop you,
Like everybody else does.

Forget about your friends they don't care where we go,
If they do, look like lost, stand in a crowd of people,
I've been looking for you,
Forever, baby, we go,
Together baby we go, we go...

In this crazy world of choices I've only got a few,
Either you're coming with me, or I'm coming with you,
Cause I finally found, I finally found you...
You never have don't worry if I what I say is true,
Girl I've been looking for you,
