Have you ever been ambushed?

[Chorus]
Every time I write a rhyme
You know it's tight
People say B-L-A-Q you out of sight
Yo chiki chiki high chiko
Comin' through 'bout to do the impossible
[Repeat]

[Verse 1]
Never test B-L-A-Q the six footer
You tried to call my bluff How could ya?
Frontin' when you ain't got straps
Why would ya?
Cuttin' hard core & ya tank's full of sugar
You can never compare to rhymes I write
My style is ferocious & I'm gettin'? for tonight
Groupies in my hotel lobby I'm hittin' on 'em
Niggas try to take my reign I'm shittin' on 'em
