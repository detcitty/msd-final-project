I haven't had a good night's sleep in weeks, now thanks to you
The ghost of broken promises you made, haunts every room
A hurtin' heart can't get no rest 'round here
I lie awake and wonder how your conscience could be clear

How do you sleep at night?
Do you toss and turn till the morning light?
Does the darkness help when you lie down with the truth?
