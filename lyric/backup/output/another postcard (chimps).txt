You can't imagine so many monkeys in the daily mail
An' all of them coming anonymously so they leave no trail
I never thought I'd have an admirer from overseas
But someone is sending me stationary filled with chimpanzees

Some chimps in swimsuits, some chimps are swinging from a vine
Some chimps in jackboots, some chimps that wish they could be mine
Star sky and hutch chimps, a chimp who's sitting on the can
A pair of dutch chimps who send their love from Amsterdam
Another postcard with chimpanzees and everyone is addressed to me
