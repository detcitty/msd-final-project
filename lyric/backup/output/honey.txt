Oh honey, you can have me when you want me
Yea
You simply ask me to be there
(Aha)
And you're the only one who makes me come running
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare, ohh

And its just like honey
(Yea)
When your love comes over me
(When your love, comes over me)
(That's right)
Oh baby, I've got a dependancy

Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
(Cryin' hoo)
One hit of your love addicted me
(Yeah)
Now I'm strung out on you darlin'
Don't you see every night and day
I can't hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey can't describe
(Woh)
How good it feels inside?
(Haa)
