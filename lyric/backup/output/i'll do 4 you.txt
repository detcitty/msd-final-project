Sweetheart, I'm talkin' to you and no one else
I just want you to know
That I'll do 4 U
If you do for me, I will do 4 U
If you do for me, I will do 4 U
If you do for me, I will do 4 U
If you do for me, I will do 4 U
Well excuse me, let me let you know the time
On how I feel and what's on my mind
It's you that I want to be in my life
And if it's possible you will be my wife
I lead you in the right direction, of course
Never play you out, so there's no laws
I'll be your love daddy just wait and see
That me and you, we were ment to be
If you do for me, I will do 4 U
If you do for me, I will do 4 U
If you do for me, I will do 4 U
If you do for me, I will do 4 U
I wanna treat ya like a queen, cook and clean
Get yo bubble bath ready so I can rub you where not seen
And watch how gentle I'll be when I rub your back
