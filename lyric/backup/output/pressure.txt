You have to learn to pace yourself
(Pressure)
You're just like everybody else
(Pressure)

You've only had to run so far, so good
But you will come to a place
Where the only thing you feel
Are loaded guns in your face
And you'll have to deal with pressure

You used to call me paranoid
(Pressure)
But even you cannot avoid
(Pressure)
