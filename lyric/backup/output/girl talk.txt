You see I had this brother who was mad at me
'Coz I told my home girl that he wasn't packin'
Told the truth so I really don't give a damn
That I spilled the beans on his little short stem man

Some of y'all be foolin' us
Big feet big hands just plain big, the sex ain't worth a damn
We women wanna know these things
If y'all got the bat but not the swang

Put in work if you don't want the girl to talk
And you don't want your feelings hurt
Put in work 'coz if you don't
That girl's just gon' go spreadin' the word

Girls talkin' got ya all caught out there
Why you thinkin' that it's all about ya?
Forget she told me everything about ya
But the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'
Girls talk about the booty too
About the way a brother is hangin' too
When you didn't think that nobody knew
You see the girls are talkin', the girls are talkin'

Listen y'all need to know this
