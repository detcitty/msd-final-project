Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy trying to find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I sweat too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let her go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag a blow
I'm like goddamn bitch I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn bitch I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these RnB niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick she go low mane

You know me, you know me, you know me
