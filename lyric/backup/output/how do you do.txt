Once I said I wanted you
I don't remember why
I often wonder if it's true
That you could make me cry

I only know it's long ago
You said "I love you" too
But I got one solution left
We're gonna start anew

How do you do, mm-hmm
I thought, why not, na-na, na-na
Just me and you
And then we can na-na, na-na

Just like before
And you will say na-na, na-na
Please give me more
And you will think na-na, na-na
Hey, that's what I'm livin' for

How do you do, ooh-hoo
