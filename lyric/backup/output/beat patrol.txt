Chorus:
Heaven move me, move my soul
Here comes the beat
Here comes the beat patrol
We will dance...

I will help you if I can
I can change the way you feel today
When your world turns upside down
It's time to make the break and dance into another day

And as the music starts to move you
Then it's time to go
Into the streets you dance
And then you lose control
