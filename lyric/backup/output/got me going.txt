(Verse 1: Brian)
There's no other love
There's nobody else I'm thinking of
Only you baby you're special
How could I ever forget you
And let the moment slip away
We've been here for a while ha!
And I just wanna take you away

(Pre-Chorus: Willie)
You got me doing things I never do
I can't stop feenin' and dreamin' about you oh
And about your love it feels so real to me
You know what to say
And you know just what to do (come get me)

(Chorus: Brian)
What you got for me (oooh)
I wanna see (you know what I wanna see)
I've been waitin' way too long
(Got me losin' my cool)
Don't know what I'm gon' do (hey listen)
You got me going
You got me going

(Verse 2: Brian)
