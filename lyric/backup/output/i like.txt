It makes you wonder just who they really are
They say money is no object and we've got a car
They kidnapped tony where did they go
They went to get it done before he got too old
Theyre incognito, they're into fame

Isn't it funny, isn't it sad
You come up empty thinking 'bout the good times that you had
But:
