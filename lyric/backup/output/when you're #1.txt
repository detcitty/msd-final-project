On the Southside of Chicago
Bobby boogie as the people
Watch him dance step on the floor

Ain't no match, you can
Catch him some night dancing
And the people in the disco
Cheer for more

And the music's fine
He's the greatest dance star
He'll blow your mind

Well, it's hard to stay on top
When you can't stop, no
You're number one, yeah

You're number one, yeah
You know, yeah
You're number one, yeah

Now Jimmy's dressed in satin
Laced with diamonds
And he has moves just like
A tiger in the night
