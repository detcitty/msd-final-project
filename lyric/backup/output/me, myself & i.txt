Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
Cause I, got me for life
yeah
Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
Cause this hunger is driving me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speaking on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
Cause I, got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul
