I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
When I'm with you Baby
All my worries disappear
Troubles that surround me
Disappear when you are near
When you need my loving
I'll be there
You know
When you need my loving
You know
Where to go

I believe there is nothing stronger than our love
I believe it
