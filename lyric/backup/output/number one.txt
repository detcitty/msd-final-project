R. Kelly:
N-N-Number one, sex that we're having here girl (Ooh)
This is number one, sex that we're having here girl (Ooh)

Girl I know you've been waiting for me, yeah yeah yeah.
And I know you been feening for me, yeah yeah yeah.
But you aint gotta wait no more girl I'm coming over.
Just leave the back door open and ooh ooh girl I'm hoping it's tight.
Cause what I'm about to do to you tonight.
Ooh girl, what I'm about to do to you gonna make your toes curl.
