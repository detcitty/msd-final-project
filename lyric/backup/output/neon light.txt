Ever since you left me
I've been ridin' 'round, cranking up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears
I don't know how much more missin' you I can take

I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
