January
sick and tired you´ve been hanging on me
You make me sad with your eyes
you´re telling me lies
Don´t go, don´t go
January
don´t be cold, don´t be angry to me
You make me sad come to see
Oh, January
Don´t go, don´t go
Life gets me higher
I can show, I can go
I can wake up the world, little world
