Pretty little girl
Standing on the corner
Waiting for the bus to come

Driving in my car
I waved, winked, and smiled
Boy, I bet she thinks I'm dumb

I've been around this block
About fifteen times
I really don't know what to do

'Cause you're so lovely
And I'm so lonely
I wish that I could talk to you

Hey, little girl
Waiting at the bus stop
You really know you're looking fine
Hey, little girl
You're looking kind of pretty
