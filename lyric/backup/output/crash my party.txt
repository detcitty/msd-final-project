It don't matter what plans I got, I can break 'em
Yeah I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don't mind tellin' all the guys I can't meet 'em
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night
Girl I don't care, oh I just gotta see what you're wearin'
Your hair, is it pulled up or fallin' down
Oh I just have to see it now

If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don't have to worry 'bout it baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
