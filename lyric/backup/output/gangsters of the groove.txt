We're the gangsters of the groove
Got a contact out on you
We're the syndicate of soul
Gonna take control

Check out the stiff that sits in the corner
Don't you know that could be you
Jump on the riff, we're givin' the orders
Watchin' everything you do

Don't try to squeal
We'll be gunnin' you down
Got the deal
Spread the message around
That the mob is hitting town tonight

We're the gangsters of the groove
Got a contact out on you (There ain't a chance that you'll survive)
We're the syndicate of soul
Gonna take control (You've got to join the winning side)
