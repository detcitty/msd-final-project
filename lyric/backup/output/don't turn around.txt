I will survive without you

Don't tell me that you wanna leave

If you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go darling
Maybe it's better that way

I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna do fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine

Just walk out that door
Yeah, see if i care
Go on and go now but

Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
