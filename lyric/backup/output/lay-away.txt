That's what I told a girl one time
I'm coming back to getcha one day
I want you to put it in a lay away

Come on, put your loving in the lay away
Coming back to get it on another day
I don't have to worry about getting away
Hey, your love is safe in the lay away

Hey, hey, hey, hey, lay away
Evetybody's got someone
They wanna keep safe away
Everybody needs someone to
Love on a rainy day
Put your love in the lay away
