Seems my life is finally coming together
Feel so good, don't think I've ever been better
It's clear to me my future will bring
The peace I've been longing for is mine forever more

It's a new day
Open my eyes and my path is clearer
New day
Pushing ahead till my goal gets nearer
New day
Spread my wings
I'm doin' things my way
It's a new day

Wasn't sure where I should begin
Couldn't tell my beginning from the end
For every door that closed a window opened
Been 'round the world and back again, it starts from within, yes
