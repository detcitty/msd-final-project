Oh, there's good 'n bad things
About the South, boy
Oh, and some leave a bitter taste
In my mouth, now

Yeah!
Like the black man livin' across the track
White man were on the other side
Holdin' him back
Way back home, now

Oh, but we won't talk about that
'Cause it's understood
Ev'rybody sees the bad
But what about the good?

Ooh, I'd give anything
Just to smell that scent
Of honeysuckle growin'
