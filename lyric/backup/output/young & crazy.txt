One day, I'll slow and lay down,
Spend my weekends in a swing out on the wraparound.
Oh but these days, I'm on a mission
To get these wild oats out of my system.
Yeah I might stay out all night,
I've gotta do a little wrong so I know what's right.

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty.
