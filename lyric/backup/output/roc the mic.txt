Roc the Mic
[B Sigel] Holla!
[Freeway] Bounce, bounce, bounce

[Beanie Sigel]
It's B Sig in the place with Young Free
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right
Still watch what you say out your mouth
Cause 50 shots still will burn the club out

[Verse 1: Freeway]
I miss the hood when I'm travelin, get neck when I'm travelin
Chicks peck wood when I'm travelin
Fuck a Lex cause the click fit good in the Caravan
Slide through your hood like a avalanche
Take a flick if you get a chance get that close
Fuck an advance, cause I get that dough
Beef with me, enemies come sleep with me for breakfast
Guaranteed to eat this toast
I'm reckless, firestarter heat your folks
A starvin artist that a eat y'all tracks, so don't bring 'em around
I be around ricans vida loca
They got all the toasters don't need no gats
I got a six stashed leave 'em around
So I don't get left around haters around when I leave
In the winter rock short sleaves reason the pound
With the heat blastin, keep actin the heat blastin
Techno Marine shinin, marine fashion backin 'em down
Niggas 'gone keep hatin and my click 'gone keep grindin
Keep movin, lockin the town

Chorus:
[Freeway]
It's Freeway in the place with B Sig
