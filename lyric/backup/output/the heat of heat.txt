In the heat of heat
The heat is so hot
My body takes control
In the heat of heat
The heat gets so hot
My passion overloads

A lonely room until you walked in
Too positive to ignore
This sensual curiosity
Affecting me like no other has before

I see your face and chills run up and down my legs
I hear your voice, my passion's pumpin' through my veins
I feel your touch, the heat is driving me insane
I lose control, I think I wanna love you
And I don't think I'll ever stop
No, I don't

In the heat of heat
The heat is so hot
