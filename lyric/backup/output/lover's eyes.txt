Love was kind, for a time
Now just aches and it makes me blind

This mirror holds my eyes too bright
But I can't see the others in my life

Were we too young? Our heads too strong?
To bear the weight of these lover's eyes.
'Cause I feel numb, beneath your tongue
'Neath the curse of these lover's eyes.
