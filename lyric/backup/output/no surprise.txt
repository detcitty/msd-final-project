And I hope...
And I hope...

I've practiced this for hours, gone 'round and 'round
And now I think that I've got it all down
And as I say it louder I love how it sounds
'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise, I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed till today
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise

(And I hope...)
It came out like a river once I let it out
