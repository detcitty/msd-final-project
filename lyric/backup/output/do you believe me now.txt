Do you remember
The day I turned to you and said
I didn't like the way he was looking at you
Yeah
How he made you laugh
You just couldn't get what I was saying
It was my imagination

So do you believe me now?
I guess I really wasn't that crazy
And I knew what I was talking about
Every time the sun goes down
He's the one that's holding you baby
