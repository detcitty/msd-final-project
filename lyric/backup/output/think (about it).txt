Hey, fellas
I'm talking to you, you and you too
Do you guys know who I'm talking to?

Those of you who go out and stay
Out all night and half the next day
And expect us to be home
When you get there

But let me tell you something
The sisters aren't going for that no more
'Cause we realize two things
That you aren't doing anything for us
We can do better by ourselves

So from now on, we gonna use
What we got to get what we want
