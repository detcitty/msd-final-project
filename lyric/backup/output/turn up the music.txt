Turn up the music, cause this song just came on
Turn up the music, if they try to turn us down
Turn up the music, can I hear it til the speakers blow
Turn up the music, fill your cup and drink it down
If you're sexy and you know it put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air, girl, put your hands up
If you're sexy and you know it put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air, girl, put your hands up

Turn up the music (just turn it up louder)
Turn up the music (I need it in my life, yeah)
Turn up the music (just turn it up louder)
Turn up the music (I need it in my life, yeah)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh (turn up the music)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh (turn up the music)
