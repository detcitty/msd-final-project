Your love is so precious and rare-iful.
I realize that when you're not around.

I've seen many guys, 
Taking advantage of you, love.
They misuse your kindness, 
As a weakness too.

No longer can I stand back, 
And watch your life fill with pain.
I seen it too many times, 
Tryin' to smile and keep the tears?

[Chorus:]
I can't stand to see you cry.
