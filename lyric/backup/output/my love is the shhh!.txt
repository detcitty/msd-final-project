[Chorus:]
Boy You'll Never Find Another Love
As Good As This
So Ya Better Represent
'cause My Love Is Tha Shhh (Tha Bomb Baby)
Girl You'll Never Find Another Love
As Good As This
So Ya Better Represent
Cause My Love Is Tha Shhh (Tha Bomb Baby)

[Verse 1:]
You Keep Telling Me On The Telephone
How Ya Got It Going On
And How You Keep Me Satisfied Oh Yea
But Actions Speak Louder Than Words
I Must See What I've Heard
Is It True Or Do You Lie
'cause I Need Somebody
Givin Nothin'but Good Lovin
All Through Tha Night Oh Yeah
Someone To Break Me Off A Little Somethin
When I Need To Be Satisfied
And I Got One Thing In Mind
