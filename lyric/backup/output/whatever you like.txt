Hey, Jim
You know the old suga daddy
They be tripin when they tell them girls
I said you can have whatever you like (you like)
I said you can have whatever you like (you like)
Yeah

Stacks on deck
Patrone on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
Baby you can have whatever you like (you like)
I said you can have whatever you like (you like)
Yeah
Late night sex so wet it's so tight
A gas of a jet for you tonight
Baby, you can go where ever you like (you like)
I said you can go where ever you like (you like)
Yeah

Anytime you want to pick up the telephone
You know it ain't nothin to drop a couple stacks on you
Wanted you could get it my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentley's, I swear
Yeah I want'cho body, I need yo body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it I got it, go get it I buy it
Tell'em other broke niggas be quiet
