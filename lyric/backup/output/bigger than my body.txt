This is a call to the colorblind
This is an IOU
Stranded behind a horizon line
Try to be something true

Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by
All this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting
For my fears to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be
Something much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body
