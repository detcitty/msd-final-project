Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

I need some help, I get beside myself
And I got so many things in life to do
Like, reach for a star or maybe shoot ten under par
I'd like to do it all before I'm through

Fly into space or maybe save the human race
All these things seem so appealing
But I'll never get the chance, 'cause all I do is dance
My mama said my brains are in my feet

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
