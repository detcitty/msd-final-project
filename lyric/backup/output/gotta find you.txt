Everytime I think I'm closer to the heart
Of What it means to know just who I am
I think I've finally found a better place to start
But no one ever seems to understand

I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be you're not that far?

You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
I gotta find you
YouÂ´re the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find
I gotta find you
Oh yeah... yeah yeah
