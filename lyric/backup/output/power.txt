My hands are clean, my heart is so pure
The world is sick, I am the cure
I don't want no money, or golden gifts
Give me your mind and souls to lift

Put your faith and trust in me
I'll move your mountains, part your seas.

All you poor, all you needy
All you're doing, is giving to the greedy
All you poor, all you needy
All you're doing, is giving to the greedy

Get off your knees, belive in me, I'll set you free
All I need is a little
Power
Power
Power
Power

I have for you, a master plan, (tell it)
I'll lead you to the promised land
I'll give you peace (peace)
I'll give you pride (pride)
I'll save you from the suicide

I'm your hope
One salvation
One man united nation
