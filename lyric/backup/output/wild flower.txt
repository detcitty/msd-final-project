She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears, Lord, Lord
And when her youthful world was about to fall in

Each time her slender shoulders
Fought the weight of all her fears
And a silent no one hears
Still rings in midnight silence in her ear

Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream 'cause she is a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growin' wild

And if by chance I should hold her
Let me hold her for all time
And if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from the garden to be mine, hey, baby

Mmm...
Ey... hey... hey... hey... yeah
