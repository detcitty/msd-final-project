I kn-kn-know a girl
She gets what she wants all the time
Cause she's fine
But for an angel, she's a hot, hot mess
Make you so blind
But you don't mind

Cause she's an uptown, get-around, anything-goes girl, girl
She's a hardcore, candy-store, give-me-some-more girl, girl

She'll make you take her to the club, but then she leaves with her friends
She likes to stay late at the party cause the fun never ends
And all her clothes are on the floor, and all your records are scratched
She's like a one-way ticket cause you can't come back

Sayin' yeah, and you want her
But she's so mean
