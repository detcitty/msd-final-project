I think I've already lost you
I think you're already gone
I think I'm finally scared now
You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong
I think you're already leaving
Feels like your hand is on the door
I thought this place was an empire
Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure

And I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life and
I think I'm scared
I think too much
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing
