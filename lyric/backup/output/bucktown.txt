I walk around town with my pound strapped down to my side
No frontin', just in case I gotta smoke some
Around here headz don't act their age
Ya might be another dead boy on the front page

Enter the cipher withcha lighter
El's are ready prepare to run another all nighter
But keep watch for the cops 'cuz they rock glocks
Comin' on the block tryin' to rock knots

Pigs be actin' like they bigga than us niggaz from da streets
'Cuz we stalk mad deep when they walk beats
I guess they hold a grudge 'cuz I won't budge
Playin' tough, starin' down da judge with my hands cuffed

Standing there with my nappy hair and my dirty gear, aw yeah
Now, I'm up outta here
Pigs look me up and down with a frown
Is it 'cuz I'm brown or is it I'm from Bucktown?
