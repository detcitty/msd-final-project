Ready to go
Ready to go
Ready to go

You're weird in tears too near and too far away
He said saw Red went home stayed in bed all day
Your T'shirt dish dirt
Always love the one you hurt

It's a crack I'm back yeah I'm standing
On the rooftops shouting out
Baby I'm ready to go
I'm back and ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out

It's a crack I'm back yeah I'm standing
On the rooftops shouting out
Baby I'm ready to go
