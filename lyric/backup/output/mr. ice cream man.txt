Before you jump in the game, let's get one thing understood
If you sellin' that ice cream, ya has to make sure it's good

Mr. Ice Cream Man
 (Mr. Ice Cream Man)

 (Mr. Ice Cream Man)

Hit the blocks dressed in white with some baggy girbaud's
A pocket full of stones, 3 G's and tryin' to lose these hoes
And the task coming sick 'cause it's the first of the month
Fiends on my pager like I'm tryin' to take these fools to lunch

Going crazy in the getto, try to kill me
My little homies lost life, y'all fools feel me
I pack a D 'cause I'm paranoid at night time
Brother be pullin' jack, I'm in the hood bustin' gangsta rhyme

And still gotta watch my back in the hood G
Like Spice-1 said,? Those fools living like movie?
Little kids get 'bout it, I mean my hood is rowdy
I'm try to make a dollar, 50 cent before I'm up and out it
