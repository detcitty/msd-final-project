(Yuh huh)
(Hey hey)

Okay, this is what I say
About when I was a young man
Back in the day
I see a young lady
Thinking she was fine
Then I try to step to her
Just to make her mine
Bet, I proceed with a plan
Tellin' her how I could be her man

Lookin' in her eyes
While I tossed the bait
But she threw it right back in my face
Now I wanted this girl just to talk to me
But she wouldn't even take the time to walk to me
I got dissed
And that made me made
So I ran home just to tell my dad
I had a question, for my dear father
If girls treat you this bad, why bother?

He said you're learnin' somethin' everyone else knows
Just listen close son
'Cause that's the way love goes
(Ah hah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
That's the way love goes
(Oh yeah yeah, that's the way love goes)
