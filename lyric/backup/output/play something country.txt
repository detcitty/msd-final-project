Yes, she blew through the door like TNT,
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me.
Said I'm a whiskey drinkin', cowboy chasin', helluva time.
I like Kenny, Keith, Alan and Patsy Cline.
I'm a full grown Queen Bee lookin' for honey.
Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' country,

Yeah, the band took a break,
The DJ played P Diddy.
She said I didn't come here to hear,
