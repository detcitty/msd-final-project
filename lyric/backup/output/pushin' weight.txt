Yeah, yeah
Blaze one for the nation
Brrrrr
Brrrrr
Brrrrr

I got lyrics that wake up spirits
They told me how to make big hits and spend digits
Can you dig it?
You fed, you dead, see red
My lead, yo head, I fed
Like you shit
I got rhymes push that shit like weight
My nigga Lincoln help me navigate
Thru this hate retaliate, it's official
I got that bomb, bomb, diddy, diddy, diddy, bomb, bomb
When I hit you
Push the issue
My ghetto dope is amazin
The bitch that's with you already know that I'm blazin
That's by the number, we can slumber, on the under
Girl no wonder, you got a ass full of thunder
The frozen Tundra ain't cold enough
And baby ain't old enough
For this game I'm rollin up
De-zamn it feels good to be the don
Straight legit, while niggas like Gotti just sit

A yeah yeah
I push rhymes like weight
I push rhymes like weight
