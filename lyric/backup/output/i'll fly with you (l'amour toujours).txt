I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you have done in your life
Baby, I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long, please come by

I, I, I, I still believe in your eyes
There is no choice, I belong to your life
Because I will live to love you someday
You'll be my baby and we'll fly away

And I'll fly with you, I'll fly with you, I'll fly with you
