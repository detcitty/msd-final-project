Somebody lied to me
It just can't be
You can't be gone forever

Somebody got it wrong
You were gonna love me
All my life

Weren't we good together
Now I'm on my own
And I don't think I'll ever
Learn to live one day alone

So I'm never gonna say goodbye
Say goodbye is something
I can't bring myself to do
