Let's talk it over now
We both have a lot to say
Let's get it over now
We can't let it go this way

We've shed our tears, we've played our parts
We've had our fears and broken hearts
But now it's time to stop this game
This foolish masquerade

It's just a game we play
We look at love through eyes so blind
