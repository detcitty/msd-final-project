Hah!

There's a time and place for everything, for everyone
We can push with all our might, but nothin's gonna come
Oh no, nothin's gonna change
And if I asked you not to try
Oh, could you let be?

I wanna hold you and say
We can't throw this all away
Tell me you won't go, you won't go
You have to hear me say
