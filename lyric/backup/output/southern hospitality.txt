(Intro 2x)
We drop bones on em
Drop bones on em
When we (throw dem 'bows)

Uh, Cadillac grills Cadillac mills
Check out the oil my Cadillac spills
Matter fact candy paint Cadillac's kill
So check out the hoe's my Cadillac fills
20 Inch wide 20 inch high
Oh don't you like my 20 inch ride
20 Inch thighs make 20 inch eyes
Hoping for American 20 inch pies
Pretty ass clothes pretty ass toes
Oh how I love these pretty ass hoe's
Pretty ass high class anything goes
Catch em in the club throwing pretty ass bows
Long jime jaws long jime stalls
Any stank puss make my long jime pause
Women on they cells making long time calls
