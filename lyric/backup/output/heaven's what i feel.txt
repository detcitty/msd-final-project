oooouoooohoooo... mmmm... mmm
love sometimes
can be like destiny...
there's no way to say forever
may not realize your dreams
and love sometimes
is like the blowin' wind
it can take us to wherever
sending us on silent wings
but i have broken
all the rules of love...
i never dreamed that
i could come this far...
and now i'm lost in my emotions
you're becoming my devotion
there's nothing i can do
to stop this love for you...

i was not supposed to fall in love with you
i have someone else...
someone else is loving you
