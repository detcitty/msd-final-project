This is it, this is what I've waited for so long
Startin' now, gotta trust these feelings comin' on
Take a chance even though I feel like I should run

Stayin' with it, let my heart take me there
Got a feelin', ooh, I'm goin' somewhere
I'm deep in it and I really do care
Wait a minute now, boy don't walk out now
