I know that winning
It doesn't come easy
I know that winning
It's what's on your mind
It's what's on your mind

I know you want it
A gift from the angels
Colors of the rainbow
You're hoping to find
You're hoping to find

Someone's gonna take it
And I'm the one

And I got just one more
Chance for Heaven
One more mountain to climb
And I got just one more
Chance for Heaven
