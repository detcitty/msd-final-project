Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Me plus you (I'ma tell you one time)
Me plus you (One time, I'ma tell you one time)
Me plus you (One time, I'ma tell you one time)
One time (one time) one time
When I met you girl my heart went knock knock

Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we gonna keep keep climbin' to the mountain top
Your world is my world

And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
When you're hurt and now you're my...
One love, my one heart, my one life for sure

Let me tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
I'ma tell you one time
(girl I love, girl I love you)
