Let me show you
Let me show you the way to go

I don't know everything
But there's something I do know
(I know, I know)
I've read and heard a lot
And now I'm ready to show
That we can come together
And think like one

Come together now
Live together underneath the sun
Please, please let me show you
Let me show you
Let me show you the way to go

Follow me, my friend
Let me show you, come on
Let me show you the way to go

Just put your trust in me
I'll try not to let you down
(Let you down, let you down)
