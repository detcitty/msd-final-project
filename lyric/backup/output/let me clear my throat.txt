At the count of three
I want everybody in the place to be
To make some noise if ya down with me
One, two, three

Hit me with the horns Tony
Keep makin' noise, keep makin' noise, yeah, oh...
Here we go now, here we go now, here we go now...
Here we go, here we go, now listen

Some of y'all might know this
And some of y'all don't (jam jam)
Some of y'all might be with this, and some of y'all won't
But listen, let me clear my throat
Oh, have mercy babe, Ha!
I hope ya don't mind, let me clear my throat

Special dedication going out to everybody here
In Bahama Bay in Philadelphia here we go now
Check it out, ah huh, ah huh, ah (God Damn)

Yeah, rock to the rhythm of the funky rhyme
So I can get this in just one more time
To the beat and ya don't quit
It's that ol' skool rap with that new skool hit
Peter Piper picked a pepper but Kool got the Run
And I can still rip up the house
Every God damn time I get on the mic, I go crazy
Peace out to Celo, Flex, and Doug Lazy
