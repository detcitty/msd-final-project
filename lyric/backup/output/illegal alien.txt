Got out of bed, wasn't feeling too good
With my wallet and my passport, a new pair of shoes
The sun is shining so I head for the park,
With a bottle of Tequila, and a new pack of cigarettes

I got a cousin and she got a friend,
Who thought that her aunt knew a man who could help
At his apartment I knocked on the door,
he wouldn't come out until he got paid.

Now don't tell anybody what I wanna do
if they find out you know that they'll never let me through.

It's no fun being an illegal alien, no
