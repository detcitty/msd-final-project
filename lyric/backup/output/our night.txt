Bet you've got a lot of lovers
Bet I'm not the only one
I've heard talk of all the others
And I know where
You're coming from

I know where you're
Coming from and going to
I even know exactly
What you're gonna do

Bet you've got a lot of hearts
Breaking up on you all the time
Well, I got my eyes wide open
And I'm telling you
You won't break mine
