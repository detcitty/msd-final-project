(girl since you been gone, just let me say, listen...)

Last night I said somethings I didn't mean to say
Somehow I let my pride get in the way
And I'm so sorrie (sorrie for hurtin you girl)
I know I was wrong, but if you just give meeh one chance
I'll make it up to you, do anything you ask meeH to

1-Cuz I don't wanna go on
With out you in my life
