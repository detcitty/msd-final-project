Somebody, please, if somebody will
Let them take a letter to my girl, Lucille
Let them tell her, Lord, how I'm missing
her still
I think about her constantly

Somebody, please, if somebody can
Let them take a letter from this
lonely man
All I ask is Lord, make her understand
I'll die if she don't wait for me

I heard a rumor from the guys in Cell A
You've served your time and you are
leaving today
