Written by Stevie Nicks.

To be the last to leave
The last to be gone
Stolen from the ones
Who held onto it
To be the last in line
Oh the ones that live on
Silhouette of a dream
Treasured by the ones
Who hung on to it

Almost a breakdown
Of our love affair
The stiletto cuts quick
Like a whip through the air
Long distance winners
