Make that move right now, baby
Make that move right now, baby

So many times
By holding back I let the good things pass me by
And then one day I asked myself the reason why
And like an answer from above you came into my life

And showed me one thing for sure
With love nothing is certain
You got to go for it when you feel it
Everybody, everybody needs somebody to love
And I choose you, baby, so let's

Make that move right now, baby
You only go out once in a lifetime
Make that move right now, baby

So natural to
Give in to feelings deep inside when love is due
And I knew something was missing 'cause I feel brand new
And motivation's in my heart whenever I'm with you

So girl whatever you do
