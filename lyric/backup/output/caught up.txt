I'm the kind of brotha
Who been doin' it my way
Gettin' my bread for years
In my career
(And every lover
In and out my life
I hear love and left the tears
Without a care
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I cant figure it out why

I'm so
(Caught up)
Got me feelin' it
(Caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems shes got me twisted
I'm so
(Caught up)
Got me feelin' it
(Caught up)
I'm losin' control

This girls got a hold on me

(Let me go baby)
(Now listen)
My momma told me
Be careful who you do cuz karma comes back around
Same ol' song
