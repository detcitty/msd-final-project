I get my kicks from watching people
Running too and fro
And if you ask them where they're going
Half of they don't know
They're the ones who think I'm crazy
'Cause they don't realize

That I'm just Groovin', oh, Groovin'
Grooving out on life
I'm just Groovin' and I can't stop Groovin'
Groovin' till I die
