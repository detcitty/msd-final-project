Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh woah) What do I stand for?
(Oh woah) What do I stand for?
Most nights I don't know anymore
(Oh, oh woah, oh whoah, oh)
(Oh, oh woah, oh whoah, oh)
This is it, boys, this is war
what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
