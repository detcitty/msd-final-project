Charlie drives a brand new Mercedes Benz.
He's got another one just like it, just like all his friends.
His wife is playin' tennis and his kids are off at school.
He drives home to his empty house and sits by his empty swimming pool.

But, he's got power windows. He's got power brakes.
He's got a power bed. Push a button and it shakes.
He's got no one to talk to and tears rolling down his face.
He's ain't got the power of love...
