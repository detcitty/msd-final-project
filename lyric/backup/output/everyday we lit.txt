I came up from nothing nigga you can't tell me shit
Did it on my own, check out my neck check out my wrist
I swear I ain't never expected it to be like this
Now a nigga gettin' rich I swear everyday we lit
Everyday we lit, you can't tell me shit
'Member I was broke, now I'm gettin' rich
Yeah when yo' diamonds colder than a bitch, then you know you lit
When you quick to take a nigga bitch, then you know you lit
Everyday we lit, everyday we lit
Everyday we lit, everyday we lit
Everyday we lit, everyday we lit
Everyday we lit yeah, everyday we lit


Can't wait to get that Vacheron
Put it on my arm
Just counted a 50 with my mom, yo' boy a don
All my cars came foreign, my chain glowin'
I ain't goin' man look where we came from
Uh all yo' bangers got my name on it
