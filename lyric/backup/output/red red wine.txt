Red, red wine
Goes to my head
Makes me forget that I

Still need her so
Red, red wine

It's up to you

All I can do I've done
Memories won't go
Memories won't go

I'd have sworn

That with time

Thoughts of you

Would leave my head
I was wrong
Now I find

Just one thing makes me forget
Red, red wine

Stay close to me

Don't let me be alone

It's tearin' apart
My blue, blue heart
I'd have sworn
That with time
Thoughts of you
Would leave my head
I was wrong
