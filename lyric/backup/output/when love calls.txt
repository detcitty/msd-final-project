Mmm... mmm...
Hey... hoo... yeah...
Ooh, ooh, yeah, whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Here I stand with open arms
I'm offerin' my love to you
I want to do for you
All the things that you want me to

There's so much more
That I could do for you, yeah
But you just won't let me give you love, boy
What is wrong with you

Don't you know when love calls, yeah
You'd better answer (You'd better answer)
If you decide to hesitate

Oh, when love calls, yeah
You'd better answer (You'd better answer)
Don't let it slip away too many times
'Cause love may not ever come again
