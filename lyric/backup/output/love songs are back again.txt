Is that our song they're playin', baby (Yeah... yeah...)
Seems like so long ago (Ooh)

Love songs are back again
Let them touch your soul
Love songs are back again
Memories carved in gold

Love songs are back again
If you still feel romance
Love songs are back again
Cause tonight we've got a chance

So let's put it all together
Let's put it all together
Let's put it all together

There's a spark of magic in your eyes
Candy Land appears each you smile
Never thought that fairy tales came true
