I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at
Let me see that ass

Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards to her
Now I'm fucking leaning on that
Bring your love baby I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain

I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here

Bring the cups baby I could bring the drank
Bring your body baby I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too
Just let me motherfucking love you
