(Verse 1: L.A.D.)
Here we go again as I proceed to get my cruise on
You and I alone, on our own
As we gon' to the top of the mountain by the water fountain gettin it on
And we aint leaving to early break of dawn
Because it's all about my baby doll and me
From the bottom of the barrel and to the top and it don't stop
Because a true G never runs outta gas
Cause if he does let him through till I let him pass
She don't get mad if I get down and heat the super stach
cause a brother like me known to make that secret blast
And I'ma make you right and ready, yo to cruise with me
But save the drama, cause can't nobody feel my lady
She never shady, she's never been that kinda flirt
And as we cruise, kick the flavor so this can work
