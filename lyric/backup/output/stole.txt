He was always such a nice Boy
The quiet one
With good intentions
He was down for his brother
Respectful to his mother
A good boy
but good don't get attention
One kid with a promise
The brightest kid in school
He's not a fool
Reading books about science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
Cause smart dont make you cool, whoa

He's not invisible anymore
With his Father's 9 and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over primetime news

Mary's got the same size hands
As Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
at Mann's Chinese Theatre show
She coulda been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole
Now we'll never know
