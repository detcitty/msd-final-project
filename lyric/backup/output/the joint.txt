Verse one: erick sermon

I make a million buck
Every six months and y'all
Hating my game, saying my name, they call
Me the e, wrong things
Knowing I'm fly without wings
While some of y'all have to pull strings.
In this era I maintain the freak upon the beats
Master basslines of raphael saadiq
Lyrical mastermind, a genius so don't snooze
No missions impossible, ask tom cruise
I keep a joint lit, when I have to spit
I rough paragraph, laugh when I'm busting yo' ass, who want it?
Come and see me, like 112
And I'll rock that bell with fox and l
E-dub, mr excitement, right
The poltergeist of rap so come to the light.
Yes, the recipient of this award goes to moi,
The best qualified superstar.

Chorus: epmd

Erick: my squad stays on point like
Den en den den de den, it's the joint
