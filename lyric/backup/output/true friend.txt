We sign our cards and letters BFF
You've got a million ways to make me laugh
You're lookin' out for me, you've got my back
It's so good to have you around

You know the secrets I could never tell
And when I'm quiet you break through my she-ee-ll
Don't feel the need to do a revel-yeah
'Cos you keep my feet on the ground

A Tr-uu-e friend
You're here 'till the end
