I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I really wanna to drive you, crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you, crazy

I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes
Swingin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizin' my name tattooed on that ass, baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi, then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feelin' like, 'maybe she the wrong woman'
Think I'ma be chasin' the chicken head, you on somethin'
Your toes painted, half fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Make the decision, Shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home, I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on
Holla at yo boy

I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your lovin'
