I'm in love all right
With my crazy beautiful life
With the parties, the disasters
With my friends all pretty and plastered
Every night we're down to go out
Wakin' up on a different couch
'Til the next night, on the next flight
Yeah, I guess we're doing alright

Oh oh oh
We're fallin' in love
Oh oh oh
'Til the sun's comin' up
Oh oh oh
Just livin' the life
Oh oh oh

Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right
