How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough to know?
When it's time, time to let go
Sing

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

I ask for a sign from the sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me
But when you think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you and you for me

Oh I cannot hide the way I feel inside
