Do you want me to slow it down?
Do you want me to speed it up?
Do you want me to slow it down?
Do you want me to speed it up?

You ain't never heard a slow jam like this
You ain't never had a remix like this
You ain't never been freaky like this
Rollin' on 24's like this
Never had a pool party like this
Never sipped on Cris much as this
Never been to an island like this
Make one wish and I'll give you all of this

Girl you remind me of my jeep and my S5
First I was on top of you now you sayin' lets ride
Freakin' yo body so good I give you wet thighs
When we get together you know we make the sex live
Take you to paradise while massaging you down
Feeling betta with twins managin' you down
Make you explode and now I'm calming you down
So good that you don't want me to bother you now

Now listen here come and kick it with the players
Ghetto majors and the thumpa sprayers and we never
Got no room for no haters when we pull up on them 24 omegas
While I'm smoking on a gar seeing Vega you by my side
We be on one when we hangin', what earthquake say is wrong
