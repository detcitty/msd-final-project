Get your money, whip ya hair
Executive branch blow my smoke like a player
Yeah in the club, yes it cracks
Cute little mama, but they stack with backs
I’m smokin’ great purple urple
You and Doggie world come and join my circle
I’ll break down herbal til I move like a turtle
My money is green and my Porsche is turbo
In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop
Maybe it’s the lawyer, her body’s the truth

I’m in the game for real, it pay’s to chill
I walk in the club and they front the bill
I’m the big dogg, best beware
You’re coming with me, if you stop the stare
She’ll be on my team in my car on the way to the spot
Yes you are, toasting up, posting up
And when we’re done, we west coasting love
For shendo blowin’ endo,
How much for the Dog in the window

Oh. what?
Boom!
Boom!
Say what? say what?
Boom!

Talk to ‘em T-pain

Baby I’m a Dogg! (I’m a Dogg!), beware! (beware!)
I’ll do whatever, however I want! (I want!)
If you call me out! (call me out!), oh yeah! (oh yeah!)
Now put your hand in the air, whip your hair and go
