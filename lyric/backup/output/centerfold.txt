Come on

Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat

She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by I'm lookin' through
A girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in between

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)

(My blood runs cold)
Ooh My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
(Angel is the centerfold)

Slipped me notes under the desk
