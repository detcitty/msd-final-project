I don't think they know the truth - say it ain't so
A-A to the L-I-Y-A-H
I don't think they know, how could they know?
I don't think they know the truth - say it ain't so

It's Breezy
I don't think they know, how could they know?
Don't let them tell you any different
(yeah-yeah, yeah, they don't know about us, they don't know about it)
I owe it all to you
(yeah-yeah, yeah, they don't know about us, they don't know about it)
And as much as I messed up, always give me your best love
(yeah-yeah, yeah, they don't know about us, they don't know about it
Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you
(yeah-yeah, yeah, they don't know about us, they don't know about it)
They gon' talk about it (gon' talk about it), gon' try to change your mind about
it
Gon' tell you things you don't wanna hear but we good (don't worry 'bout it)

So when they talk about (they talk about it), just let 'em know we already got it
Just tell 'em that we gon' work at it, we good (don't worry 'bout it)
I don't think they know the truth - say it ain't so
