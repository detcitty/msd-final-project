Bass

Like 007 I'm on a mission
Makin' people dance, droppin' suckas who dissin'
Keep the crowd movin' 'cause the beat is kinda soothin' yo the ear
Yo', I give you what you wanna hear
I could make you dance and make you shout
'Cause I'm all about the M-O-N-E-Y, without a doubt
And I won't stop until I make you rock
So understand that I can make you dance, dance, dance, dance

The beat is on, you know it's hittin'
Get on the floor, don't wanna see nobody sittin'
'Cause I go in slow when I'm on the mic
