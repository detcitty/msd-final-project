Tenemos tremendo lio
Last night you didn't go
A la casa de tu tio (Huh?)
Resulta ser hey you were at a party
Higher than the sky
Emborrachada de Bacardi (no i wasn't)
I bet you didn't know
que conocia al cantinero (what?)
He told me you were drinking
and wasting my dinero
talking about
come in and enjoy
what a women gives an hombre
(but first of all see, I have to know your nombre)
But I really wanna ask ya que si es verdad (would I lie?)
and please por favor tell me la verdad
cause I really need to know, yeah
necesito entender if you're gonna be a player
or be my mujer
cause right now you're just a liar
a straight mentirosa (who me?)
