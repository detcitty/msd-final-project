She turned away
What was she looking at?
She was a sour girl
The day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl
The day that she left me
She turned away
What was she looking at?
She was a sour girl
The day that she met me
Hey! What are you looking at?
She was a happy girl
When she left me
What would you do?
What would you do
If I followed you?
What would you do
If I follow?
