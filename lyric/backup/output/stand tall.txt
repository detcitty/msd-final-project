Never been this blue
Never knew the meaning of a heartache
But then again, I never lost at love before

Somewhere down the road
Maybe all those years will find some meaning
I just can't think about them now or live 'em out anymore

Never lasted so long, no
Through so much or through so many
I just can't believe I could throw it all away
