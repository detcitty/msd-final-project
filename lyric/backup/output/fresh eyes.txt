I got these fresh eyes, never seen you before like this
My God, you're beautiful
It's like the first time when we open the door
Before we got used to usual

It might seem superficial, stereotypical, man
You dress up just a little and I'm like, "Ohhh, damn"

So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
