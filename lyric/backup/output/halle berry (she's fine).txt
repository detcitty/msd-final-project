She finer den a B, ass and her T
Thick in tha hips, every nigga wanna call her
Miss Berry, Miss Berry
(Miss Berry)
Miss Berry, Miss Berry
(Miss Berry)

She walkin' like a model, hands on your knees
Scrub the ground, she ain't nothin' but a tease
Miss Berry, Miss Berry
(Miss Berry)
Miss Berry, Miss Berry
(Miss Berry)

Well, let's get ratchet, let's get ratchet
Look at her prettier than Halle and thicker than Janet
She say she like all of my club bangers I be jammin'
I told her to bust it open let me see what's really happenin'

She the ship and I'm the captain, I'm the captain
Booty bigger and the pussy be poaching that make me happy
And I'm all the way in your city, I'm from Louisiana
So you gotta show me how your city do it for tha camera

Make it drop and bring it back to the top, I'm no amateur, girl
You could give it to me, it ain't nothin' I can't handle
She just got out of the shower smellin' like a scented candle
And I'll bend her, bend her backwards, I'll have her slidin' off the mattress

No movin', no actin', baby this real action
Beat it up so bad you be scared to walk past me
I know you're Halle Berry, baby this no actin'
I beat it up so bad you be scared to walk past me for real
