You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soir√©e
If you're in the mood to sit tight right where you are, babe

Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'm a bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
