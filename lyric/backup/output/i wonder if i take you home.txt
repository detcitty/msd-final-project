Take me home
Take me home

Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
'Cause I'm not too sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace

And I know and you know that if we get together
Emotions will go to work
And I may do something I might regret the next day
And end the hurt

Oh, I don't know
The way that I feel
I'm so afraid of a one night deal

I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby
Because I need you tonight

I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby
Because I need you tonight
Home

Your love is
(Take me home)

Lately, you've been expressing to me
Just how much you want to make love
I want it just as much as you do
But will you still keep in touch?

You say I'm teasin' but I do have a reason
Don't let your feelings fade
'Cause you will have me and sooner than you know it
