You know I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die
Check it, I grew up a fucking screw up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fucking blew up

Chopping rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
