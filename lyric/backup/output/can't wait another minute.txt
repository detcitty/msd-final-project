I've been holding out on you
I've been taking it slow and tough
Cause you've got a reputation
For leaving when the loving gets rough

But my heart is reaching for you
And my love is getting stronger
There's an urgency, a need in me
I can't take it any longer

No, I can't wait
I can't wait another minute
For it all to begin
No, I can't wait
I can't wait another minute
So let your love come rushing in

I can't wait
I can't wait
