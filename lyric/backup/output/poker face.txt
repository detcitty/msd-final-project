I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it; baby, stay with me (I love it)
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
Mum mum mum mah
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
