Atlanta lady, I'm losing my mind
Girl, I want my arms around you now
For the thrill of you one more time
There's just something about your love
There's just something about you

You make me laugh, you take me away
Girl, I miss your sweet caress right now
And the thrill of you one more time
There's just something about your love
