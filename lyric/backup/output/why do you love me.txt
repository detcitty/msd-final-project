I'm no Barbie doll
I'm not your baby girl
I've done ugly things
And I have made mistakes
And I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines
I am rotten to my core if they're to be believed

So what if I'm no baby bird hanging upon your every word
Nothing ever smells of roses that rises out of mud

Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy

Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy

Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy

Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
