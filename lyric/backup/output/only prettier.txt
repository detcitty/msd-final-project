Well, I've been saved by the grace of southern charm
I got a mouth like a sailor and yours is more like a Hallmark card
If you wanna pick a fight, well, I'm gonna have to say good night
I don't have to be hateful, I can just say, "Bless your heart"

And even though I don't belong with your high life friends
Doesn't mean we don't get together and try to make amends
It's easier can't you see? Let's agree to just disagree
