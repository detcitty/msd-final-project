You've got this new head
Filled up with smoke
I've got my veins all tangled close
To those jukebox bars you frequent
They're the safest place to hide

A long night spent with your most obvious weaknesses
You start shaking at the thought
You are everything I want
Because you are everything I'm not

And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
