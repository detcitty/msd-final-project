I'm your joystick
I'm your joystick
I'm your joystick
Take control

Come turn me on, get it on
Baby, I'm your joystick
Your joystick, baby
I can do anything
That you want me to do
Ooh, ooh, yeah

I can prove that love
Is just like a video game
Just take control of the stick
Of the stick, of the stick
I'll let you play your game

I know what you're looking for
And all I want to do is score, yeah
I just want you to be mine
Just take control
I'll let you play me all the time
Take control of the stick
Of the stick, of the stick
Of the stick, of the joystick, baby

Oh, baby don't you know
That I'm your

Turn me on, let's get it on
