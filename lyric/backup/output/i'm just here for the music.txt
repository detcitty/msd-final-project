Spinning to the sound
Like a record going 'round
Must be the music

We could be making out
But all I really want right now
Is just the music

I'm only here to dance
I'm not looking for romance
So watch me work it

I've gotta get a fix
Of my daily mega mix
So keep it grooving

I'm just here for the music
I really didn't mean to turn you on
(On)
