And it feels right this time
On his crash course with the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
New day fills his head with wonder, boy

Says it feels right this time
Turned it 'round and found the right line
Good day to be alive, Sir
Good day to be alive he says.

Then it comes to be
that the soothing light
