Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow

One night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco
I was cruisin' with my favorite gang
The place was so borin' filled with out-of-towners tourin'
I knew that it wasn't my thing

I really wasn't carin', but I felt my eyes starin'
At a guy who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

Oh, what, wow
