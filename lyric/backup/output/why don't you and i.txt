Since the moment I spotted you
Walkin' round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies oh and it's alright

Bouncin' 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feelin' like I'm never gonna come down
If I said, I didn't like it then you know I'd lied, ooh

But every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
(Tongue-tied)
Everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

So I'll say why don't you and I get together?
And take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will and tails we'll try again
