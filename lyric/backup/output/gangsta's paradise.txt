As i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
i take a look at my life and realise there's none left
'cause i've been brassing and laughing so long that
even my mamma thinks that my mind is gone
but i aint never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
you better watch how you talking, and where you walking
or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
i really hate to trip but i gotta lope
as they croak i see myself in the pistal smoke ... fool
i'm the kinda g that little homies want to be like
on my knees in the night, saying prayers in the street light
They been spending most their lives living in the gangsta's paradise
