We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on top of the car
He drank beer out of a mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed

A wide frame house in a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown
But we tried our best anyway

We went to class just to pass the time
