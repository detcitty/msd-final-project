Bang, my shit bang, it bang bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang bang

I guess I went commercial
Just shot a commercial
When I flew to the set though
I ain't fly commercial
And the ad is global, yep

Your ad was local
Where we shot it was a lot of different agriculturals
So I laugh at hopefuls
Nicki pop, only thing that's pop is my endorsement op
Fuck around I have to go and reinforce the glock

Bang, my shit bang, it bang bang
Bang, my shit bang, it bang bang

Is it me or did I just put these rap bitches on the map again?
You mad 'cause I'm at the Grammy's with the Vatican
You in the booth, but I'm who you be channeling
Why they never bring your name up at the panel then?

Hottest MC's, top five!
You need money, I got mine
More knots than Eric from (ya dig?)
