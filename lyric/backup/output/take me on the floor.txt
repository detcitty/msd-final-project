You say that I'm the one
So why the need to run
When all I want from you
Is to hit me with the truth
Wanna take take take it all i just want you tonight
Wait wait don't you see that it doesn't feel right
And leave me hanging on

I don't wanna always take it slow
I just want someone to take me home
You say that you love me
Well don't let me down
I don't wanna hear you say goodbye
I just wanna hear you'll stay the night
You say that you love me
Well show me right now

Don't wanna let this go
Don't wanna take it slow
