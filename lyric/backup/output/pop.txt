Dirty pop

I'm sick and tired of hearing
All these people talk about
What's the deal with this pop life
And when is gonna fade out
The thing you got to realize
What we doing is not a trend
We got the gift of melody
We're gonna bring it till the end
(Come on now)

(It doesn't matter)
'Bout the car I drive or
What I wear around my neck
(All that matters)
Is that you recognize
That it's just about respect
(It doesn't matter)
About the clothes I wear
And where I go and why
(All that matters)
Is that you get hype and
We'll do it to you every time
Come on now

Do you ever wonder why
This music gets you high?
It takes you on a ride

FEEL IT WHEN YOUR

Body starts to rock
(Your body starts to rock)
And baby you can't stop
(You can't stop)
And the music's all you got
This must be,

POP!

Dirty pop
Baby, baby you can't stop
I know you
Like this dirty pop
(This must be)
