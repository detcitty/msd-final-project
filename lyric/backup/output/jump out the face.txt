I just took a perc now I'm on another level
Tasting on the molly got me dancing with the devil
Poured 8th for Kobe Bryant mixing purple with the yellow
Got these racks on demand hard to keep this shit together
Jump out the Rari then jump out the Wraith
Then I hop in Margiela then hop in some Bape
Then jump out the face
Then jump out the face
Money gon stack and this money gon fall

Came from the hood now we jump out of states
Peep all these diamonds they jump out the face
Ducking them diamonds and selling this white
Got to watch for these niggas they'll jump on your case
(watch all these niggas, these niggas ain't playing)
And none of this money don't come out the safe
Fuck with my dawg knock a chunk out ya face

Nigga I be so high I could jump out to space
