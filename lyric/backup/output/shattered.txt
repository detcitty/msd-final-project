Shattered, shattered
Love and hope and sex and dreams are still surviving on the streets
And look at me, I'm in tatters
I'm shattered
Shattered

Friends are so alarming, my lover's never charming
Life's just a cocktail party on the street, Big Apple
People dressed in plastic bags (Shadoobie, shattered)
Directing traffic, some kind of fashion
Shattered

Laughter, joy, and loneliness and sex and sex and sex and sex
And look at me, I'm in tatters
I'm shattered
Shattered
