You lied to me

You lied to me

Lies

You lied to me

Lies

Lies

You lied to me

You lied to me

You lied to me

Every time you said goodbye to me
Another girl you'd hurry off to see
But I'll get over you
I will get over you

You're my life I still cannot believe
Another love would lead you to deceive
But I'll get over you
I will get over you

You got another lover
You lied to me
You got another lover
So now I'm free

You got another lover
You lied to me
You got another lover
So now I'm free

In between the nights alone with me
You gave your love to someone elses needs
But I'll get ovr you
I will get over you

So now I'm gone you stripped me to the bone
I should have guessed the way my seed was sown
But I'll get over you
I will get over you
