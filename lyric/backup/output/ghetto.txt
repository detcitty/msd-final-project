Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto we livin'

These streets remind me of quicksand
When your on it you'll keep goin' down
And there's no one to hold on too
And there's no one to pull you out you keep on fallin'
And no one can here you callin'
So you end up self destructing

On the corner with the tuli on the waist line
Just got outta the bing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
'Cause they said that I wouldn't make it I remember like yesterday
Holdin' on to what God gave me

'Cause that's the life when your
Living in the
(Ghetto)
And eating in the
(Ghetto)
Or sleeping in the
(Ghetto, ghetto)
That's the life when your
Living in the
(Ghetto)
And eating in the
