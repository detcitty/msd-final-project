You're a song written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
Right under your clothes
Is where I find them

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
