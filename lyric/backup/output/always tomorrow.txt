Always Tomorrow
 ---------------
 
 (Gloria Estefan)
 
 
 I've been alone inside myself for far too long
 Never really wanted it that way but I let it happen
 If I could do it all again my life would be 
 Infinitely better than before I wouldn't waste a moment
 (I'd) Make time for laughing with my friend
 Make love, make music, make amends
 Try to make a difference try to love, try to understand
 Instead of just giving up I'd use the power at my command
 
 Chorus
 ------
 'Cause there's Always Tomorrow to start over again
 Things will never stay the same the only one sure thing
 	is change
 That's why there's Always Tomorrow
 
 I guess it took a little time, for me to see
 The reason I was born into this world and what I'd have
 	to go through.
 For I've finally realized that I could be
 Infinitely better than before definitely stronger
 I'll face whatever comes my way
 Savor each moment of the day
 Love as many people as I can along the way.
 Help somone who's giving up if it's just to raise
 	my eyes and pray.
 
 Chorus

 Bridge

 Before your last setting sun
 And everything your heart has longed for
 Has yet to be (one)
 Yes there's Always Tomorrow though people come and they go
 But if you've brought some love to their lives
 Then you've got something to show
