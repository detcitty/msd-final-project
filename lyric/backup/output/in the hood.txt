This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day

As I step on the scene, yo I'm steady maxin'
And I call up my boys 'cause I'm looking for some action
We need to kick it like we use to
Back in the days when we were known as the crazy crew
It's good to reminisce on the old days
