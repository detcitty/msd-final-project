As it grooves, your body moves
Your body starts to get the feeling
And what you're feeling is happiness

Let your body go as you listen
Let it flow to your system
It'll take control of your mind
And make you move your behind

As it grooves
You feel the tension
In the air and now you're hype
You're getting down 'cause
The sound is just your type

GN and D-o-s-e
Sticking it to you right
So come on, come on and
Party hearty all night and

[CHORUS]
Wiggle it just a little bit
I wanna see you
Wiggle it just a little bit
As it grooves
Wiggle it just a little bit
I wanna see you
Wiggle it just a little bit
As it grooves

Once the DJ lets it spin
