Oh Yeah

I can't find myself
When you go away
Makes me wonder where you are
Is there someone else
I just need to know
This charade has gone too far

For the first time in my life
Feel I'm losing control
I can't keep pretending
It's my soul that you own
I need you

My heart's in your world tonight
(Possession)
And you hold the key to my life
(Possession)
