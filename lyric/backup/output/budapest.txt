My house in Budapest, my
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful Castillo

You
You
I'd leave it all


My acres of a land
I have achieved
It may be hard for you to
Stop and believe


But for you
You
I'd leave it all


Oh, for you
You
I'd leave it all

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
