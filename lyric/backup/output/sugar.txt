Da, double dee, double di
Double dee, double da, double dee, double di
Double dee, double da, double dee, double di
Double dee, double da, double dee, double di

My lips like sugar, my lips like sugar
This candy got you sprung, this candy got you sprung
So call me your sugar, so call me your sugar
You love you some, you love you some

(I'm sweet like)
Da, double dee, double di
Double dee, double da, double dee, double di
(I'm sweet like)
Double dee, double da, double dee, double di
(I'm sweet like)
Double dee, double da, double dee, double di
Sugar

Hey, I've got a mouth full of cavities
Sweet tooth, full of mama, like sugar to me
So my love with the lips, put a bug in the ear tone
Shawty gotta kiss, it's an emergency

Spit sprung for the taste, addicted to her gloss
One smile this way, baby, I rub it off
Put my tongue in your face
A little mistletoe, sippin' Gran Marnier, I'm a fan all day

Do me that favor, 'cause I like your flavor
My manage behavior; I'm into your major
Sweeter so flavor, that's good for this player
