Eww, yeah...
need a helping hand,
of all the people in the world,
i hoped you`d understand.
you and me
have grown so far apart.
don`t show me faded photographs,
just tell it from the heart.
And after all that we`ve been through,
don`t you know i feel for you,
we`ve got nothing in common,
so much to lose, yeah yeah yeah.
