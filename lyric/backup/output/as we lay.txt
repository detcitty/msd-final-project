It's morning,
and we slept the night away~
It happened,
now we can't turn back the hands of time
(oh no)

Yes we've stolen this moment,
We forgot to face, one simple fact
We both belong~ to someone else
As we slept, the night away

It's morning,
sunlight shines across your sleeping face (uh huh)
A new~ day,
brings reality that we must go our
Se~parate way
What a lovely night, we had (yeah yeah)
