I'm on my grind, grand hustle
Got the mind and the muscle
50 carrats in the crown just to shine on you suckas
I still tote the Glock 40 for the haters and the bustas
Fuck probation, if a nigga try to play me I'ma bust him
Ion't need no security, reaching for my jewlery
Get you niggaz popped quick, filled full of hot shit
Fresh out the box Tip hot than a drop 6
Made a quarter mil' in the penn givin' stock tips
Haters wanna stop Tip, mad 'cus they not Tip
Ball every summer so your baby mama jock Tip
You don't no drama pimp, I promise I do not slip
Chrome 4-5th, hid well if the cops trip
Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of dat
5 carrat stones with the platinum all up under dat
Rap beef I ain't gonna participate in none of dat
