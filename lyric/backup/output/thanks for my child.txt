You came into my life, you just made everything right.
and even though my man has left me behind,
i don't regret a thing for having you.
Thanks for my child,
i'm really thanking you, the man above
thanks for my child
you brought me so much joy
this bundle of love
thanks for my child
and though your father, he ran away free.
the love i have for you baby, is the love i have in me
I'll stay and watch you grow, yes i will!
