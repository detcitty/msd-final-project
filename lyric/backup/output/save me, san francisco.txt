I used to love the tenderloin
Till I made some tender coin
Then I met some ladies from Marin
We took the highway to the One
Up the coast to catch some sun
They left me with these blisters on my skin
Don't know what I was on but I think it grows in Oregon
So, I kept on going, going, gone right through
I drove into Seattle rain, fell in love then missed the train
That coulda took me right back home to you

I've been high
I've been low
I've been yes
And I been oh hell no
I been rock 'n roll and disco
Won't you save me San Francisco
Ooo ooo ooo, oh oh
