Up every evening 'bout
Half eight or nine
I give my complete attention
To a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a
He's got more channels
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
I brought my baby home, she, she sat around forlorn
She saw my TVC one five, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my, she crawled right in my
So hologramic, oh my TVC one five
Oh, so demonic, oh my TVC one five
