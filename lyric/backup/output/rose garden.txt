I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Aolong with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain some time

When you take you gotta give so live and let live or let go
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
