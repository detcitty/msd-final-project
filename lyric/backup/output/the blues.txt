Randy Newman
Miscellaneous
The Blues
He's gonna tell you 'bout his dear old mother
Burned up in a factory in Springfield, Mass.
He's gonna tell you 'bout his baby brother
Hustlin' down the city streets
And selling his ass for a dollar bag
He's gonna tell you 'bout his uncle Neddy
Locked up in a prison out in Oregon
He's gonna tell you 'bout his best friend Eddie
Killed in a bar fight with a pair of Marines
