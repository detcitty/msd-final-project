He finally gave into his friend's girlfriend when she said
"There's someone you should meet."
At a crowded restaurant way 'cross town
He waited impatiently

She walked in, their eyes met, and they both stared
And right there and then, everyone else disappeared

But one boy, one girl
Two hearts beating wildly
