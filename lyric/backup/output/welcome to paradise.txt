Sour milk in the saucer
And the cat won't come home
And sometimes New York City
Feels like burnin' Rome

I'm lost and I'm crazy
Too much time on my own
I'd give anything to find a heart
That can't be sold

Welcome to paradise
Here is my brave new world
And in my paradise
I'm waiting for a certain girl

Dead flowers in the darkness
Red rose wrapped in lace
Ice-cold vodka tears
Stainin' my face
