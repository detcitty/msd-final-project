When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of
The things that I don'tknow
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes

And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
And in the dark I found, I stop and I won't fly
And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along

I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see a sweet life
