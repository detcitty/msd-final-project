I wanna let you know
That you don't have to go
Don't wonder no more
What I think about you

If it's loving that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's loving that you need
Baby, come and share my world, share my world
If it's loving that you want
Come and take a walk with me, walk with me
'Cause everything that you need, I got it right here, baby, baby

Now it's obvious you need a friend to come hold you down
Be that one you share your everything when no one's around
Baby, come tell me your secrets and tell me all your dreams
'Cause I can see you need someone to trust
You can trust in me

Di di di di di di di di di da di dey
So just call me whenever you're lonely
Di di di di di di di di di da di dey
I'll be your friend, I can be your homie
