Hey baby won't you tell me what you've got going on
Just a little later on tonight
How about you and me get together have a couple drinks
Well don't you think that sounds like, a good time

You start stridin' over
We can't get no closer
Ain't no room in the middle
Girl watcha' doin' a little later

Let's go start a fire
How about you and I get this thing movin' shakin' grovin'
Baby tell me what your doin'
