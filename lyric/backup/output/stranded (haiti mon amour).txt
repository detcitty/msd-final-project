Yeah, yeah, yeah
The sky falls and the earth quakes
We gonna put this back together
We won't break
The sky falls and the earth quakes
We gonna put this back together
We won't break
A port of princes, a Haitian goddess
And all of my princesses, our condolences
As we fight against this, we're right by your side
While we trying to make sense of this
Heavenly father, help us see through these problems
And put those that left, accept them into your garden
So, here's my theory, the country's already starving
So we sacrifice many to shed light on all of them
Y'all please, I speak from my heart
The only way I can see this tragedy befalling
So let's get involved with it, hand to hand, arm to arm with it
To make it strong again when the sky falls
