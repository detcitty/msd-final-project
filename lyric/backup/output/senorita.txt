Ladies and gentlemen
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine

Yes, yes I am

And he goes by the name...
Justin
Wowoowoooo

All the way
from Memphis, Tennessee
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all
About this girl

Come in right here?

Yea, come on

On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now
Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...

Running fast in my mind
Girl won't you slow it down
