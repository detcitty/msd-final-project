Been fourteen days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know, know what I mean?

I just saw her yesterday
I just saw her, asked her to stay
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean?

Her and Bobby were steppin out
Her and Bobby didn't know I found out
Do you know what I mean?
