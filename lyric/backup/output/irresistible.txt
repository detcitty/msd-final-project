Irresistible baby you are
Irresistible baby you are

I lay awake at night, you're on my mind
I know the things I said were far from being kind
Sometimes the hurt inside can cloud the dream
And now I've hurt you saying things I didn't mean
The downright power of emotion
Will not threaten my devotion
I'm forever waiting for you
Irresistible baby you are
You are you are
You're so adorable baby you are
You are you are

You got a part of me inside your soul
I need you here with me in order to be whole
