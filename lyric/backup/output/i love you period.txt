Hey, back when I was going to school
I never learned a thing
All I did was daydream
A-waitin' for the bell to ring
I had a certain teacher
I always tried to impress her
When she stood up in the classroom
I would mentally undress her
Then one day I decided
That I would write a little letter
She said the spelling was a masterpiece
The punctuation could be better
I understood what she was saying
