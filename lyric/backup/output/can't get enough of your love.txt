I've heard people say that
Too much of anything
Is not good for you baby
But I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved
Shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me
Like it's ever, ever enough
It's just not enough

My darling, I, can't get enough of your love babe
I don't know I don't know I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love babe

Oh some things I can't get used to
