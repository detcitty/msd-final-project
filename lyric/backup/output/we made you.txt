Guess who?
Did you miss me?

Jessica Simpson, sing the When you walked through the door
It was clear to me(clear to me)
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see (who theycame to see)
You're a rockstar (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wantsyou)

Playa, Who could really blame you?
We're the ones who made you
Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac forantacid if you can
Get ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How doesit feel? Is it fantastic? Is it Grand?
Well look at all the massive masses inthe stands
Shady, man, no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back, as nasty as he can?
Yes he can-can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend

But Lindsay, please come back to seein' men

Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see you grin
When you walked through the door
