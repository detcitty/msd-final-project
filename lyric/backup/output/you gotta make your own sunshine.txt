Whenever the day is bringing you down
And nothing's going your way
Just turn it around
Don't let the world upset you
Get depressed and what doesn't get you
You've got a chance to make it
Reach right out and take it
Leave your worries behind
You gotta make your own sunshine
You gotta make your own sunshine

If nothing in life is turning you on
