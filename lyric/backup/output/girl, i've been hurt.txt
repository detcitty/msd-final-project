Girl i've been hurt
Girl i've been hurt
You said there will be no other love
But me but girl i know much better
I'm no fool; you've been playing games on me
Come here tell me what you're thinking of (of)
Is he real, have you found another love?
How long must we play this masquerade?

Chorus
Girl i've been hurt now i need another lover
You are no?
