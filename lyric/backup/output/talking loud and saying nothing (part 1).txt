Like a dull knife
Just ain't cutting
Just talking loud
Then saying nothing
Just saying nothing
Just saying nothing
You can't tell me
How to run my life down
You can't tell me
How to keep my business sound
You can't tell me
What I'm doing wrong
When you keep driving and
Singing that same old money song
You can't tell me
Which way to go
Cause three times seven
And then some more
