Day by day
And night by night
I see you in my mind
It happens all the time

You know my daydreams stop
My heart beats on
I can't take it anymore
It's you I live for, ho, baby

You are in my system
I just want you to know that, oh
You're in my system
Got me burnin', burnin', baby, oh
You're in my system, oh
You're in my system
Don't you, don't you, don't you know that, baby

I will keep on pushin', pusin'
Until I get through
My main objective, baby
