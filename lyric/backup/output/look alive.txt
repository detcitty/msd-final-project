I'm so far out of sight
Sounds about right

I'm so far out of sight
Yeah that sounds about right
Sounds about right
Kill this club, not my vibe
Be the highlight of my night
Look alive, look alive
We can start with something light
Look alive
I can get you so right

I just need an invite

I'm a smooth criminal
Michael Jackson moonwalkin'
Like I'm on a pill or somethin'
Five bitches 'round me, mane
