Call me, were the last words I remember
Then the spring became December
And I still got no reply

Politely, I would ask whoever knew ya
What it was that I did to ya
But they all knew less than I

If this letter doesn't make it clear
Its been a cold and lonely year
In my empty bed, in my head I can feel you near
