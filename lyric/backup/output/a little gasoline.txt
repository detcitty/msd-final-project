Throwing pictures out the window
Scattered by the way the wind blows
Bye bye baby, that's the last I'll see of you
Shoebox full of old love letters
I'll tear each one till I feel better
And I won't look back, 'cause I don't like the view

What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
