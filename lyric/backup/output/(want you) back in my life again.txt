You know it doesn't seem that long ago
That I had your love and let it go
And I really let you down I know
I'm losing your love

I guess it took a while for me to see
What it is you really mean to me
I've been as big a fool as I can be
For losing your love

I want you back in my life again
I don't want to be your remember when
I want you back in my life again
