Well we grew up down by the railroad tracks
shootin' b.b.'s at old beer cans
chokin' on the smoke from a lucky strike
somebody lifted off of his old man
we were football flunkies
Southern rock junkies
crackin' up the stereos
singin' loud and proud to "Gimme Three Steps"
"Simple Man" and "Curtis Low", we were good yuh know

we got some discount knowledge at the junior college
where we majored in beer and girls
