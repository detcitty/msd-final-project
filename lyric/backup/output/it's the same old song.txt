You're sweet as a honey bee, but like a honey bee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain
All you've left is our favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories
Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
 (Don't you hear it now, oh)
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
Now it's the same old song
 (Don't you hear it now, oh)
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

A sentimental fool am I
To hear a old love song and wanna cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
I keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart
Saying together forever, breaking up never

Now it's the same old song
 (Don't you hear it now, oh)
But with a different meaning
