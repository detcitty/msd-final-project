I heard it on the radio
Somebody reaching out tonight
Another soul that never sleeps
Until the shadows
Touch the morning lights

I know you well
I've been holding on,
Weak and strong,
But right or wrong

I had to call your number
I had to know for sure
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Do you really wanna fall in love?
Take the chance again.
Do you feel inside?
The fire never dies
And it burns until the end
Do you really wanna give enough?
Talk all night,
Make love in the rain.
