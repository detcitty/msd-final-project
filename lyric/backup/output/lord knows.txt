All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom
Lord know, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows
Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows
Nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows, nigga lord knows

Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like 50 bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad she one my Christmas list
Remember I prayed I really wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that remembered we took some risks for this
I'm talking risky business, flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows that if I get penned for this I prolly won't get home until I'm 56
They said I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars
They spit my new verse at your wake while your lying
The middle the Church, at your wake, no I'm lying
I just came from jail, ain't do no crime
They put me through hell sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and rode with the lion
Like hold up
From balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble I'm cocky as hell
Shout my bitches that answered my calls when I called to collect cause it got me through hell
