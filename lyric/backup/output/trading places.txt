I know what you're used to
We're gonna do something different tonight

Now we're gonna do this thing a lil' different tonight
You gonna come over and pick me up in your ride
You gonna knock, then you gonna wait
Ooh, you gonna take me on a date
You're gonna open my door and I'ma reach over and open yours
Gonna pay for dinner, take me to see a movie
And whisper in my ear how bad you really wanna do me
Girl, now take me home and get up in my pants
Pour me up a shot and force me to the bed

I'm always on the top, tonight I'm on the bottom
'Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
'Cause we trading places

No, put it on me, baby, till I say, ooh, wee
And tell to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
