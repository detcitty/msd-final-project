I heard she sang a good song
I heard she had a style
And so I came to see her
To listen for a while

And there she was
This young girl
A stranger to my eyes

[CHORUS:]
Strumming my pain
With her fingers
She was singing
My life with her words
Killing me softly
With her song
Killing me softly
With her song
