I apologize I don’t recollect your name
(Oooh, baby I don’t know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame
(look at your body baby)
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl how could we get that way?

Look, another day another dollar
She hate me when I leave cuz when I leave I never call her
That’s life shit, alright, shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call you gone be like “Boo why we haven’t skyped yet?”
And I skype, bet you say “Lay where my flight at”
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer my life is quite deceptive
