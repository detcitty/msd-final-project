Don't you know I saw you, baby
As I passed you by
Don't you know I caught it
With a gleam in your eye, yeah

I know that you want me, baby
This you can't deny
You know that I want you, baby
Please don't say goodbye

I'm the one that needs you, baby
Tell me that's no lie
You know that I want to, baby
Why can't we give it a try
Good, good times for you and I

Just let it come now, baby
Let your colors show
