Wake up feeling blessed up

Pistol on that dresser

Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up

Riding in that Testa... rossa, nigga catch up,
Sipping on that syrup till I'm messed up like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
You walk around with lasers, you probably own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimpin hoes
You could tell by my paystubs
My niggas getting right, smoking weed with dirty sprite
Going wild for the night Fuck being polite
Finna wild out for the weekend
Me, myself, and I my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, ASAP niggas finnna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
