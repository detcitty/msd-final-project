If dis one of my hoes, two-way me

Ay, ay, Snoop whattup? This your nigga Dre
Ay man, I was thinkin', I ain't said shit on
Your whole motherfuckin' album
So check it out, put this on there
All you motherfuckin' haters out there, can suck my motherfuckin' dick
And we still smokin', what?

For the nigga who be talkin' loud and holdin' his dick
Talkin' shit, he better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick
Now she sick, she better lay low

For the niggaz who be claimin' my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinkin', I'm just talkin'
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

Hmm, lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rollin' deep like the President
See, I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse

We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg and ain't no stoppin' this
Whatever the case, I ain't tryin' to catch it
