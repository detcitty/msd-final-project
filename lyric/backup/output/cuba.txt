Cuba, quiero bailar la salsa
Cuba, quiero bailar la salsa

You dance to the music
Like nobody does
The first time I saw you
I knew it was love

Cuba, quiero bailar la salsa
Cuba, quiero bailar la salsa

My heart is on fire
The night is divine
My only desire
Is making you mine

Your the one that I want
Heart of fire
Your the one
Yes you are
