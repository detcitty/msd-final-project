As the sun is rising we'd come back to earth
I'm gonna leave your lovin' and it's gonna hurt
So glad I got you I don't wanna let you go
These precious moments are what life's about
If you didn't know that already one kiss will ease your doubt
No need to hurry 'cos I'm right here next to you
And whatever we do
