(Gary Nicholson/Allen Shamblin)

I'm gonna live, laugh, love just for today
Gonna take all the trouble that tomorrow might bring and put it away
Gonna drink every drop of happiness
'Til they cover me up
I'm gonna live, gonna laugh, gonna love

I got a buddy that wakes up worrin' about stocks and bonds
He's up and he's down and he only smiles
When the markets strong
I spend my whole week wages
At the dance on Saturday night
