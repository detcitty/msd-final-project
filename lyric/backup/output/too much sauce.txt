That's too much sauce
That's too much sauce

Patek Philippe, the plain one
That's too much sauce
Hermes in the A
That's too much sauce
They let me know before I was famous
I had too much sauce
Audemars, Hublot now
That's too much sauce
That's too much sauce
Got too much sauce
That's too much sauce
I got too much sauce
Patek Philippe, the plain one
That's too much sauce
Got diamonds on all on my fingers
That's too much sauce

Yeah, all of my diamonds they shine
Haters like "knock that off"
