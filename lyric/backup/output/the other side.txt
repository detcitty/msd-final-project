Mm mm mm, mm mm mm
mm mm mm, mm mm mm mm mm
Yeah, come on
Lovin' you has got to be Take me to the other side
Like the devil and the deep blue sea Take me to the other side
Forget about your foolish pride Take me to the other side
Oh take me to the other side Take me to the other side
My mama told me there'd be days like this
And man she wasn't foolin'
'Cause I just can't believe the way you kiss
You opened up your mouth with bated breath
You said you'd never leave me
You love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss
You're cryin' me a river, but I got to get across
Lovin' you has got to be Take me to the other side
