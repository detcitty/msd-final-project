Sitting here
Wasting my time for you
And I'm not too crazy
About the idea
Of having nothing to do

I'm tired of playing around
A girl in every town, oh
I wanna settle down
And stop fooling around

I've got to stop fooling around
(Let's get married)
Stop fooling around

You don't believe me
But I want to stop fooling around
