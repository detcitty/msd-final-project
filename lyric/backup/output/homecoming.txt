Yeah
And you say Chi City
Chi City, Chi City

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again, 'min' home again

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Wendy and I like to blow trees"

And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from outta town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their act 'cause she know they soft

And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
And at nighttime my face lit up, so astoundin'
