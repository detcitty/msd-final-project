working hard to make a living
bringing shelter from the rain
a father's son left to carry on
blue denim in his veins
oh oh oh he's a working class man

well he's a steel town disciple
he's a legend of his kind
he's running like a cyclone
across the wild mid western sky
oh oh oh he's a working class man

he believes in god and elvis
he gets out when he can
he did his time in vietnam
still mad at uncle sam
he's a simple man
with a heart of gold
in a complicated land
oh he's a working class man

well he loves a little woman
someday he'll make his wife
