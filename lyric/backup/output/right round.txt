You. spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Hey, walk out the house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' 'about clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry, that's always on whoa

I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies it's on
Then pop in the night 'cause this mix'll be ours

We keep a fade away shot 'cause we ballin'
It's Platinum Patr√≥n every hour
Lil' mama, oh, you just like the flowers
Girl you the drink with all that goody power

You spin my head right round, right round
