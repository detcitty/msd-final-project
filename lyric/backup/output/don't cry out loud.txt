Baby cried the day the circus came to town,
'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her.
So she painted on a smile and then took up with some clown,
While she danced without a net upon the wire.
I know a lot about her, 'cause you see,
Baby, is an awful lot like me.

Don't cry out loud,
Just keep it inside,
And learn how to hide your feelings.
