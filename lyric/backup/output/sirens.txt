Hear the sirens
Hear the sirens

Hear the sirens
Hear the circus so profound
I hear the sirens
More & more in this here town

Let me catch my breath to breathe
And reach across the bed
Just to know we're safe
I am a grateful man
The slightest bit of light
And I can see you clear

Have to take your hand, and feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose
