See he's my property and any girl that touch
I might just call your bluff 'cause I don't give a, whoo
Are you to call my cell, oh, I'ma wish you well
'Cause any girl that tried has fell

Where my girls at, from the front to back
Well is you feelin' that, well put one hand up
Can you repeat that, tryin' to take my man
See I don't need that, so don't play yourself

Where my girls at, from the front to back
Well is you feelin' that, well put one hand up
Can you repeat that, tryin' to take my man
See I don't need that
