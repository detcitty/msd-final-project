You've got to move it to the rhythm
You've got to move it to the beat
You've got to move it to the rhythm
You've got to stomp your feet to the beat

Move it to the rhythm
You've got to move it to the beat
You've got to move it to the rhythm
You've got to move your feet, stomp that beat

We oughta really get it on, get it on, get it on
We gotta get it on
