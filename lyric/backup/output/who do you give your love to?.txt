Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
It hasn't been like it used to
Who do you give your love to?

The wind blows, are we not friends?
There is no reason to let it end
Until you set me down
You say you don't love me anymore.

I always thought that we could work it out
To keep on loving, I had no doubt
But it's all over town that you went around
I think it's happening girl

Who do you give your love to?
Where do you drown the fire?
