It's all the same.
Only the names will change,
Everyday
it seems were wasting away.
Another place
where the faces are so cold
I drive all night just to get back home.
I'm a cowboy.
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted,
dead or alive.
Wanted,
dead or alive.

Somtimes I sleep,
sometimes it's not for days.
Now people like me,
