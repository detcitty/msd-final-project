Uh huh, yeah, aw, man
I got a sweet tooth, can you dig it?
After this one you gon' need a root canal
I love sugar all of it

This one for all the nice clean
Decent women
Lay it on me, girl
Pay close attention

She put that sugar on my tongue
She's gonna gimme, gimme some
She put it right there on my tongue
(Sweet, sweet, lover, lover)
Right there on my tongue
(She turns me on, like no other)

And gimme some of your butter pecan
Put it right there on tip of my tongue, put it
Right yeah, 'cuz, baby, if I bite you
I bet you like it

French Vanilla's a hell of a flavor for me
With strawberries, two cherries and whipped cream
The best dreams are the wet dreams
And uh, the rest is just a flick without a sex scene

Orally, I speak the truth
'Cuz the blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
Cuz, Florida oranges and Georgia peaches

When they nice and ripe
They the best for eatin'
All these southern boys be cravin'
For a whole slice of pie after they main course

So if you game for it
