Straight up, now tell me do you really wanna love me forever
Oh, oh, oh
Or is it just a hit and run

(I wanna see you work for me, work out for me)

Hey, we got a good thing
Don't know if I'ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am
I know whats on your brain
You're probably hoping never would end
Like is it the real thing
Or is it just a one night stand

Let me see you get high and go low
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me

High and go low
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me

She like them bar with the big old chains
Ride around town in the big old Range
I knew her when I riding big old chains
Now the little nigga doing big old things
Would you look at that, I came back for her
Just to give it to her, like you asked for it
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for her
It rebounds so I caught it off the backboard
