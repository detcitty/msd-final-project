Call me when your man ain't around
I don't mind being the dude on the side, ya dig

Turn around, let me lick you from your neck down to your navel
'Cause shawty you look ready
Forget the bed, I wanna lay your body right here on the table
So just hold it steady

I'll go get the camera, we can make a movie
I'ma gonna put my hands up, lay back while you do me
Jump right out the shower into the jacuzzi
Giving you what your body wants

I'm boyfriend number 2
'Cause the first one he don't really seem like he know what to do
I'm boyfriend number 2
And I know you like it freaky so I'm gonna give it to you

I'm boyfriend number 2
Don't fuss, don't fight, don't argue
'Cause second place always got a whole lot to prove
