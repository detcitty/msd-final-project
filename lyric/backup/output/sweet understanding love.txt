Into my life you came
Spreading a glow you shared my name
Baby, Lord knows I'm not ashamed
To tell the whole world I love you, yeah
Stretch out your hand, pick me up
Nourish me from the lovin cup
Till my cup runneth over
With your sweet-er understanding love
Undemanding love
And it sho nuff love, hey baby
