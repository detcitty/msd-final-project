I don't need me a basketball player
All I need is somebody that's down for me
And he don't have to have money
His love is just like honey
It's so sweet to me
He can have everythin' in this world
But he'll sacrifice it all for me
And I made up my mind
I'm in love this time
And it feels so real

And I know that he won't break my heart
And I know that we won't never part
