Little Suzi's on the up, looking for a get-away
Ruby tries to bring her down, she's looking for another way
Little Suzi's on the up, heading for the spotlights
Ruby finally gets up, lookin' for some quiet night

And the music makes her feel so hot
And she'll smile for the camera with all she's got
Don't bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far if her dreams come true
