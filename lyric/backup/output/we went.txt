Black pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas
ready and throwing up a little dust
like a pick up truck
does in the mud but ain't nobody slowing' us down
right now

She said I need a little something with some get up and go
And nobody knows how to get me going
quite like you do when you doin the things you do
Wanna give this sleepy podunk town
something to talk about
