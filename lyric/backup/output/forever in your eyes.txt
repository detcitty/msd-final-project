It came unannounced
This feeling I feel for you
I had to know
Was it love you felt too

Not through your words
But the way that you looked at me
Told me just how
How much you really care

So don't you try and hide your feelings
'Cause it's so very plain to see
I can see forever
Forever in you eyes

Just let your heart faithfully guide you
Guide you to love infinity
I can see forever
Forever in your eyes

Here we are
Baby, the time is right
Now there's no doubt
