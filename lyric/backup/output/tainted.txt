Real love, true love
It feels good girl
Tainted love
It's so good girl, real love
True love, it's alright baby tainted love, real love, true love
Tainted love

Think of her think of me, think about us it's a intimacy
I'm trying to strum like guitars in this beat
And consider riding she'll kick the blahzay spleen
Plus you got a man but he ain't quite me
The type of man that try to give you what you need
And he wanna know where you are where you be
Where you going where you today where you started to be, damn
If I was him I wouldn't even leave
I would trust you what you say that you are where you been
Say he the type of nigga that's still cheap
Take his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's
See I'm the type that try to style in a jeep
