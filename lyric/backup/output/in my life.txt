Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Lil' children, dogs and cats
Right now, you are listening to the incredible drum patterns of
DJ Mannie fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh

Ladies and gentlemen
I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels
I'm a fuck ho's, I'm a smoke weeds
Got a lot of drinks, steppin' out gators, coca cola mink
I need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life

I'm a buy cars, I'm a get clothes, I'm a rock jewels
I'm a fuck ho's, I'm a smoke weeds
Got alot of drinks, steppin' out gators, coca-cola mink
I need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, I'm a keep it in my life

It's ya nigga Juve, from the Magnolia, still lookin'
You ho's gon' know what's up with me bust it wide open
Loose chest, loose booty round down and up
If a gangsta can't touch it, what you bouncin it fo'
Now give me leway, watch how a G play
Watch how my name get caught up in the he and she say
It's U.T.P. day, we with the streets may
They represent us when they hear us at the DJ's

Break bread with me nigga, demand with me
Though we was beefin', your supposed to spend your cash with me
I'm in here last with me, hold me down, give me a whip, give me
A trick and let her blow me down
I'm so gutter, I'm so slick, I'm so grimey
I promise you somethin', I bet you gon' find me
