(Ian Hunter/Mick Ronson)

Oh no, the fuzz, all in a line
My oh my, I think I'm gonna die
And it's just another night
It's just another night

Got a long black face; Who goes there?
All the reefer madnessput a poor kid in jail
And it's just another night
Yeah, it's just another night

Oh take it easy boy or it's DOA
Chrome on my body and a lot of folks say
That it's just another night
Hey, It's just another night
