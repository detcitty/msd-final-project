saying goodbye is never an easy thing
but you never said, t hat you'd stay forever
so if you must go
well, darlin' i'll set you free
but i know in time
that we'll be together

oh, i won't try
to stop you now from leaving
'cause in my heart i know
love will lead you back

someday i just know that
love will lead you back to my arms
where you belong
i'm sure, sure as stars are shining
