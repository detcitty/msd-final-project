Standing on a corner
Passing time away
I thought I heard an organ grinder
Singing as he played
He had a little monkey
With a little cup of tin
And he danced for joy
hen someone put a penny in

He sang, love me, love me, love
Why did you ever leave me, girl
If you love me, love me, love
Why did you ever go
If you love me, love me, love
