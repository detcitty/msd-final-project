Somedays it's tough just gettin' up
Throwin' on these boots and makin' that climb
Somedays I'd rather be a no show lay low
Before I got outta my mind.

But when she say baby
Oh no matter what comes ain't goin' no where she runs her fingers through my hair
and saves me.
Oh that look in her eyes got me comin' alive and drivin' me a good kinda crazy
