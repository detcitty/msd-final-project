(feat. Kelis, Pharrell Williams (Neptunes))

(Intro: Pharrell)
(Get down!)
Niggas and bitches (Get down!)
You are now listening to... (Get down!)
The real... (Get down!)
And that would be... (Get down!)
Clipse, the Neptunes... (Get down!)
And the new label... (Get down!)
Staaaarrr Traaaak...

(Pusha T)
Top down, chrome spinnin'
You see the boss grinnin', I'm lovin' these damn women
I let two get in (Uhh...)
She tried to let the rest fit in
I'm like, "Naw love, that's forbidden i aint for squishin'"
That's a problem to the wheel well
Trust I know them twenty's real well
Now we coastin', me, two chicks and toastin'
I turn up the volume watch the bass get 'em open
Soft-spoken, with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they love it in the ride
We was movin' bodies before we hit the party
'Fore the DJ started cuttin',
(Scratches) "I was already fuckin'..."
Cinderella these girls from nothin' to somethin'
Hit the parking lot, hear the club system thumpin'
Lose the face, you two's was great
But it's to the VIP, I got new moves to make (Get down!)

(Chorus: Pharrell)
When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke somethin', drink somethin', get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl (Get down!)
Only if you know you've arrived
From the club, to the park and ride
How many chicks can you fit in that ride
Put 'em up, homie (Get down!)

(Malice)
Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
