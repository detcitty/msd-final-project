Cold winds rarely blow
Here at the end of the rainbow
Guess it's hard to believe
I'd be willing to leave
Someone walked up behind me
Seemed to find me
I felt him standing there
I turned around and saw
The face of an angel
I fell, it wasn't fair
It just wasn't fair

He took my heart
It was a landslide
You know it was a landslide
My head was saying
This is the man
My heart agreed
Minor desires turn
To major needs
And needs won't be denied
It was a landslide

Somehow I'm thrilled by all he says
High on his campaign of promises
