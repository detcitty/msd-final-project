I walk the streets at night
until the morning light comes shining through
Can't get a good night's sleep
Ain't been to work in weeks
What am I gonna do
Help me

Can't get her off my mind
I'm drinking too much wine
I'm burning up inside
If I could touch her face
or take her out some place I'd be satisfied

Hey, I'm a loaded gun
I'm crazy about her, crazy about her
Hey, I'm a lovesick son
