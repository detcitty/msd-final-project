I know I got a bad reputation
And it isn't just talk, talk, talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got

I couldn't have one conversation
If it wasn't for the lies, lies, lies
And still I want to tell you everything
'Til I close my eyes

Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappear below my feet
Been breaking down
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?

Suddenly I'm down in Herald Square
Looking in the crowd, your face is everywhere
