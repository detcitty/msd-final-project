Yeah, turn it up
Yeah, turn it up
Yeah, turn it up...

T-turn it up, t-turn it up
T-turn it up, t-turn it up

Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance no more

Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance
Dance til you can't dance no more

It's the swing time
To bring forth the rhyme
That's designed to put you
In a hip-hop state of mind

Intro, I'll disperse the verse
That'll make you move
To a C and C groove

True indeed
Some believe the brothers
Can you swing it hard core
Strictly for the dance floor

Not the stereo type
Get the crowd hype
It's 1992
And hard core is the type
And a rum-a-num-a-num

Take a seat as I take my stand
And fasten your seat belt
Cause I'm about to crash land

Into a dope rhyme
Not the type of style
That I be flexing on a regular
Kicks the rap amplified
Category executor

Mentally, physically
Lyrically, it's gotta be
Stunning, I'll make you move
So what you wanna do is

Hip-hop non-stop
(Keep it coming)
Take it the the top
(Keep it coming) on and on
(Keep it coming)
Keep it going til the break of dawn
(Go, go, go)

Hip-hop non-stop
(Keep it coming)
Pump it up
(Keep it coming)
(Keep it coming) on and on
(Keep it coming)
