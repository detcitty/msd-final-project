I'm cold
(Yeah)
I'm cold
(Yeah)
I'm cold
(Yeah, yeah)

I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite 'cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare

Well how did you get there?
'Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is farewell, yeah

I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So goodnight, I made it out the door
Door, door, door, door

After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
