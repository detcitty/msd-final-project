I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

You are my love light, this I know
And I'll never let you go
You my all, you're part of me

Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need you, I call your name

â? Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
â? Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise

â? Cause I never knew love like this before

This feeling's so deep inside of me
Such a tender fantasy
