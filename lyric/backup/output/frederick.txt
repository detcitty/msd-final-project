Hi hello, wake from thy sleep
God has given your soul to keep
All of the power that burns in the flame
Ignites the light in a single name

Frederick, name of care
Fast asleep in a room somewhere
Guardian angels, lay a bed
Shed their light on my sleepy head

I am a threshold yearning to sing
Down with the the dancers having one last fling
