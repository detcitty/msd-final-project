I used to hurry a lot
I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out 'til the break of day
Oh, that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way
Oh, I did some damage
I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely 'til I found you
You can go the distance
We'll find out in the long run
(in the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one
