And when I wake up in the morning
To feel the daybreak on my face
There's a blood that's flowing through the feeling
With a knife to open up the sky's veins

Some things will never change
You just stand there looking backwards half unconscious from the pain
It may seem rearranged
In the backwater swirling there is something that will never change
