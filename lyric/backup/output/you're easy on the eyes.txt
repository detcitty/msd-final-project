Shoulda known it was you knocking on my door
At half past a heartache at quarter to four
Were you starting to worry I was finally getting over you
I almost forgot you looked so fine
If you told me some lies, it would be like old times
Just getting to see you is almost worth the things you do.

Chorus:
You're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye
Before this goes too far
'Cause now I realize you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart.
