I can't imagine how to tell my story and, ah...
Not fuss or fight, but... I really wanna talk to you
You see, I'm not in agreement with the law this morning
So don't be my judge and jury, do I get through to you
But every time I try to build up my case
You tear it down with your pretty face
You stand your ground
And show the lightning in your eyes
And then I feel it

Cool magic wins me over
Oh, so silent, always strong and I tell ya
