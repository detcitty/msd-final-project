Mmm hmm, la la, oh, yeah

What's that sound, so profound
Over heads of children, Lord
As they pass

Sounds like thunder
But there's no rain
This kind of thunder blows down
Doors and walls and things

Ah, somebody's crying
For those dying
But no one knows
How long it's gonna last

Steel birds falling to the ground
Not knowing what's below
When the end comes, tell me now
Where we gonna go

Oh, people, that's my
La la la la peace song
