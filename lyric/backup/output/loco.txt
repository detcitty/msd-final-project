Little hula girls on the shot glass
All we need's a little salt & lime
We can plug in the hot pepper lights and pretend
That we're livin' on Key West time
I can run to the store and get some charcoal
Buy a tiki torch and fire up the grill
The whole town wants to know when I'm gonna grow up
But you know I never will

Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright
