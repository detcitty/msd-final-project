Chris Breezy!
It's me!
Hey!

Uh oh!
U-uh u-uh, uh oh!
U-uh u-uh!

I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel â€~cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill â€~cause I give 'em what the girls like

I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel â€~cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill â€~cause I give 'em what the girls like

Relax and take notes while I put you up on game
Get a sweeter connect than if I put you up on cane
But you should grab yourself a seat and a whiskey double
Because the girls of the world ain't nothin' but trouble

They like a little danger, they might not admit it
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowin' with swag
And keeps his woman all draped in new Louis Vuitton bags

And Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to 'em
