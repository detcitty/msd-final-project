LA - here's to you
For being the kind of place a man can do his due
Out here the hippies skip, and they get their kicks
Bumpin' all night long, out on Sunset Strip
To the music of the brother man, who's got himself a plan
And makes him gain a boogie, man

Down at the Disco... 9000
You better get down early, it's gonna be crowdy
Down at the Disco... 9000
People from coast to coast are talking about it, about it
