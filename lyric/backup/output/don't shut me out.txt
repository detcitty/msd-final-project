Don't shut me out maybe baby
We should talk about it
'Cause you've got your doubts but maybe, baby
They might be unfounded

Have a little faith you'll make it through
I'd never hesitate to talk to you
If you tell me just what's weighing on your mind
Maybe it could help you sleep tonight
So don't shut me out
