Let's do it,
Let's do it,
Oooh... baby... take your time
Let's do it, come on, baby
Oooh... baby... take your time
Let's do it...
You know you ought to slow down
You been working too hard
And that's a fact.
Sit back and relax a while
Take some time to laugh and smile.
Lay your heavy load down
So we can stop and kick back
It seems we never take the time to do...
All the things we want to, yeah
Now, baby we can do it
Take the time
Do it right
We can do it, baby
Do it tonight
