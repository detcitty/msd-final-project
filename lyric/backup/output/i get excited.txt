Well, you admit you like the game
But you're not gonna play
You just ignore what your body is tryin' to say
I got the feelin' that you're playin'
And we're both gonna win
And I think this angel is about to sin

I get excited
Just thinkin' what you might be like
I get excited
There's heaven in your eyes tonight
The fire's ignited down below
It's burning bright
