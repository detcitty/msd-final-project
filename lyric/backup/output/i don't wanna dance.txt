I don't wanna dance
Dance with you baby no more
I'll never do something to hurt you, though
Oh but the feeling is bad
The feeling is bad

I love your personality
But I don't want our love on show
Sometimes I think it's insanity
Girl the way you go

With all of the guys on the corner
Oh baby, you're the latest trick
