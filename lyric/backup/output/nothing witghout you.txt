I realized, I belong to you
I feel the darkness, I run away from you

Don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
I learned to love you, the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
I'd be nothing', nothing', nothing', nothing' without you
