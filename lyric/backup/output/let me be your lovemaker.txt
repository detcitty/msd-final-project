Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker
Let me be your lovemaker
Let me be your soul shaker

Around this time last summer
when you and I first met
I thought I was cool
Living by the rules
Trying to play hard to get.

So you found some good-time chick
To give you the love you needed.
I didn't know a thing
about the thrills love could bring
I was young, selfish, and conceited.
