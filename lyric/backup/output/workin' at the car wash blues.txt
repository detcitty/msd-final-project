Well I had just got out from the county prison
Doin' 90 days for non-support
Tried to find me an executive position
But no matter how smooth I talked
They wouldn't listen to the fact that I was genius
The man said, "We got all that we can use."
Now I got them
Steadily depressin', low down mind-messin'
Workin' at the carwash blues.

Well I should be sittin' in an air conditioned
