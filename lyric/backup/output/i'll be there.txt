You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there

(I'll be there)
I'll reach out my hand to you

I'll have faith in all you do

Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)
And oh, I'll be there to comfort you

(I'll be there)
Build my world of dreams around you

I'm so glad that I found you
(I'll be there)
