Girl you’re beautiful
You’re bout near perfect
But I bet somebody’s already told you that
Name your poison
Name your passion
Cause a boy like me just couldn’t help but ask
Keep on talking to me baby
I’m hanging on your every word
Keep those drinks a coming maybe
We’ll both get what we deserve

How bout baby
