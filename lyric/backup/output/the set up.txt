Bitch I see you, cause you know I know you
Yeah I know you.

Last time I saw you
You was brewed up, booed up, ready for a new fuck
Last time you saw me
I was P-I to the motherfucking M-P WHAT!
And lately I heard you's a broke bitch livin in the lower class suburb
And lately the word is I live in a suburb and I don't fuck with birds
She used to pump on the block
Sell a nigga rocks, bail a nigga out BUT!
She tried to plot on a nigga, vacan't lot one shot bitch died go figure
He used to pay this bitch, gave her lots of shit
