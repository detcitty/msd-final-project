(Phone rings)
Hello?
Hello, Bill. This is Pablo
Where are you?
I won't be able to make it today
Because I'm at the bottom of the pool
(Hang up)

Oooooo...
When my baby,
When my baby smiles at me
I go to Rio
De Janeiro
My-o me-o
I go wild and then
I have to do the samba
And la bamba

Now I'm not the kind of person
With a passion or persuasion
For dancin' or romancin'
But I give in to the rhythm
And my feet follow the beating
Of my heart

Whoa oh ohh
When my baby
When my baby smiles at me
