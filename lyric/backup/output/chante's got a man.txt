Chante's got a man at home and he's so good to me...
Verse: I'm sorry that- your man ain't home- and I'm sorry that yours left you
alone. It's such a shame- your man is playing games- I heard you say that
men are all the same, no, no, no,
(break) That's not the truth girl cause I got proof girl(Oh I got proof
girl) I got a man at home.
