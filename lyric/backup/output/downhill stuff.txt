Blue river blues
I'd rather be outside
Here I am inside
Watching it rain

Blue river blues
I'd rather be somewhere
Here I am nowhere
Watching it rain

One, two, three, four!

Some people like that downhill stuff
They like it fast and breezy
Some people walk on the other side
They like it slow and easy

Some people run on a mountain trail
