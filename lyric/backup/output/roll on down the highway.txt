We rented a truck and a semi to go
Travel down the long and the winding road
Look on the map, I think we've been there before
Close up the doors, let's roll once more

Cop's on the corner, look he's starting to write
Well, I don't need no ticket, so I screamed out of sight
Drove so fast that my eyes can't see
Look in the mirror, is he still following me?

Let it roll down the highway
