When the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
Oh, when the girls, when the girls talk
When the girls talk boys
Hey!

When you're talking to your girls
Do you talk about me?
Do you say that I'm a sweetheart?
Do you say that I'm a freak?
Do you tell them white lies?
Do you tell 'em the truth?
Do you tell 'em that you love me
The way I've been lovin' you?

Cause every night you and I find ourselves
Kissing and touching like no one else
Falling and falling until I fell
For you
