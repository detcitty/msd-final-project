We was huntin' bear in our rockin' chair out on I-40
Dodgin' bumps in pick-up trucks in west New Mexico
It was a cloudy day and me and ole Jay just about bored to tears
But we come awake when a C.B. breaker come a ringin' loud and clear

We heard this voice that we ain't never heard before sayin'
(Break 19, I'm C.B Savage, Hi all you 18 wheelers
Anyone seen any smokey bears, 
How about some bears smoking, aha C.B. Savage here come-on)

Well, I looked at Jay, and I said Hey, did you hear what I just heard
He nodded his head, and his face got red, we never said a word
