Walking like a man
Hitting like a hammer
She's a juvenile scam
Never was a quitter
Tasty like a raindrop
She's got the look
Heavenly bound

'Cause heaven's got a number

When she's spinnin' me around

Kissin' is a colour

Her lovin' is a wild dog
She's got the look

She's got the look
(She's got the look)

She's got the look

(She's got the look)

What in the world can make a
Brown-eyed girl turn blue?

When everything I'll ever do
I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la
