Ah, yo, roll the track, uh, yeah
Kick, stick, ah, stare, vocals, ah, yeah

It doesn't matter, what time of the day
Ask me what I'm thinkin' about and it's you that I'm gonna say
Twenty-four seven, fifty-two, three sixty-five
Just wanted you to know how you stay on my mind, yeah

All I do is think of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(Everyday, every night, yeah)
All I do is speak of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(I can't keep it to myself, no)
All I do is dream of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(Dreams of you every night, yeah)
All I do is think of you, baby, all the time
(All the time, all the time)

You've got somethin' special, worthy of my love
And I don't wanna let go, just keep on holdin' on
Oh, you got me goin', thoughts of me and you
And I can't help but talk about all the sexy things you do

All I do is think of you, honey, you stay on my mind
(Hey, all the time, oh)
