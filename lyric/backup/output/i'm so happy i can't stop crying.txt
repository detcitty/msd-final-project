Seven weeks have passed now since she left me
She shows her face to ask me how I am
She says the kids are fine and they miss me
Maybe I could come and baby-sit sometime

She says, "Are you okay? I was worried about you
Can you forgive me? I hope that you'll be happy"

I said, "I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears"

Saw a friend of mine, said, "I was worried about you
