Sad sweet dreamer
It's just one of those things you put down to experience
Sad sweet dreamer
It"s just one of those things you put down to experience

Been another blue day without you girl
Been another sad summer song
I've been thinking about you girl
All night long

Been another sad tear on my pillow
Been another memory to tell me you"re the one, girl
