You're talking it all sounds fair
You promise your love how much you care
I'm still listening and still unsure
Your actions are lacking, nothing is clear

No more words
You're telling me you love me while you're looking away
No more words, no more words
And no more promises of love

Remember when the words were new
They carried a meaning, a feeling so true
I'm looking for a long romance
Not a picture of passion or one time chance
