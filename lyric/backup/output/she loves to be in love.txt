The postman came today
Another letter from the USA
That makes it four this week
Just put that with
The rest of the heap

(Ooh, my friend)
She sure has got it bad
(Ooh, my friend)
You're the first big
Love she's had

[CHORUS]
She loves to be in love
She don't care if you're not there
She can make it alone
She loves to be in love
She don't care if you're not there
This thing is her own
