Before we begin, thank you
Thank you, oh thank you, thank you, thank you

I'm not a bad person, I don't drink and I don't kill
I've got no evil habits and I probably never will
I don't sing like Elvis Presley, I can't dance like Fred Astaire
But there's one thing in my favor, I'm a millionaire
(What, that's beautiful)
