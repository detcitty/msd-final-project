Go on and close your eyes,
Go on imagine me there
She's got similar features with longer hair
And if that's what it takes to get you through
Go on and close your eyes, it shouldn't bother you

You never had to wait for nothing in your life
I guess wanting me must have been a steel blue knife
And when night after night the scent of passion would linger
You had to have the jewels wrapped around your finger
Now you keep running down the road in your midnight state of mind
Curiosity kills if you can't read the signs
