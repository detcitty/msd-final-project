I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE TO YOU
-Helen Reddy-
you say it would be better
if we stopped seeing each other

if you had only met me first
when you were free
'cause now you've got commitment
i should not expect things from you

that you can't give to me
oh, but baby, can't you see
i can't say goodbye to you
no matter how i tried

you're such a part of me
without you, i would die
