I had to learn, learn a lesson
Never forget to count your blessings
I had to learn, learn a lesson
Never forget to count your blessings

You can say I love you
Too many times, oh, oh
Simple things mean so much
Like when was the last touch
When was the last kiss
When did you hold em like this

I almost lost the one I love
Searching round for something new
Before you make the same mistake
Oh, let me pass this on to you

I had to learn, learn a lesson
