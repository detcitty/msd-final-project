Alright, come on, sing it one time
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sing, oww
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ha, ha

Walked in this place, surprised to see a big girl gettin' busy
Just rockin' to the go-go beat
The way she shook her booty sho' looked good to me
I said, 'Come here, big girl, won't you rock my world?
Show that dance to me'

She was doin' the butt, hey pretty, pretty
When you get that notion, put your backfield in motion, hey
Doin' the butt, hey sexy, sexy
Ain't nothing wrong if you wanna do the butt all night long

(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
