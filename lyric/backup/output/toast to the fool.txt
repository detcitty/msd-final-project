You gave your all and all to him
He wasn't true
He tried to find another girl
Sweeter than you

Imagination sent him
On a wild goose chase
But now he sees that no other girl
Could ever take your place

So now he's trying hard again
To get you back
But you know the fool's heart
Was made of cellophane
And you see through that

When he had your love
In the palms of his hands
He just wasn't unsatisfied
I said, he jived and connived
And he had to have another girl
Right there by his side

Oh, let's give a toast (give a toast)
(Give a toast) (give a toast, yeah)
To the fool (to the fool)
Who let you go (who let you go)

Let's give a toast
(Give a toast) (give a toast)
(Here's another toast, yeah)
To the fool (to the fool)
Who let you go (who let you go)

But now we're together
