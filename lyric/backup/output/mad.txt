Woah, ohh
Woah, ohh
Woah, ohh
Woah, hmm

She's staring at me
I'm sitting wondering what she's thinking
Nobody's talking
'Cause talking just turns into screaming

And now is I'm yelling over her
She yelling over me
All that it means

Is neither of us is listening
(And what's even worse?)
That we don't even remember why were fighting

So both of us are mad for nothing
Fighting for nothing
(Crying for) nothing

But we won't let it go for nothing
(No not for) nothing

This should be nothing
To a love like what we got
Oh, baby, I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now

'Cause I can't sleep through the pain
