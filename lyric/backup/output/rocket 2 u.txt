Baby, baby, when I called you on the phone today
You sounded frantic when you said "Come over, right away"
Oh, baby, baby, won't you say what's on your mind?

Your TV set is acting up and you don't understand
You're so upset because you can't watch "All My Children" and
You wonder if there's something I can do for you

Well all that I can say...

Baby, I can rocket 2 u
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby, I can rocket all night (rock the night away)
One thing I know I can do (I can rocket 2 u!)

Don't call me when your car just can't get into second gear
