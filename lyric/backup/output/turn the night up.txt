Baby, it's you and me
You see, we can turn the night up
And if you feel the way I feel
We can turn the night up

(Gimme some of that)
(Yeah)
(Gimme some of that)
(Gimme some of that)
Damn you look so sexy
Baby, you impress me
I wanna get nasty, ah, nasty
Girl you got the bom bom
Take a shot, you want one
Mama I can change your life (woo)

(gimme some of that)

The way you do it (woo)
