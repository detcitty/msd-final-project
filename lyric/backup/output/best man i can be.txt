From best man soundtrack

[r.l.]
Yeah this is for my brothers in the hood
And the high risers, on the mansions with the maids
We gotta come together, come on y'all
Case, ginuwine, tyrese, and me r.l.
Help me sing it fellas, yeah

[case]
I'm sitting here alone
Trying to face another day
Gotta stay strong, hmm
To endure this pain

[r.l.]
I'm dealing with right now
It flipped my whole life upside down
I don't want your help
I don't need your sympathy, no

[all]
What can a brother do for me?
(see he can you help you up when you are down)
What can a brother do for me?
(he can be your eyes when you can't see)
What can a brother do for me?
(he can help me be the best man I can be)
(oh I can be, I can be, oh I can be, I can be)
He can help me be the best man I can be
(oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
