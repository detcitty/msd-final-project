(Can you fill me in)
I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said hey boy, come on right around
So I knock at the door
You was standing with a bottle of red wine
Ready to pour
Dressed in all that Satin and Lace to the floor
So I went in

Then we sat down start kissing
Caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi
Sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
Please leave a message after the tone
I'm not being mean
Her Parents were kinda cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
we were just doing things young people in love do
