Life is so strange when you don't know
How can you tell where you're going to?
You can't be sure of any situation
Something could change and then you won't know
You ask yourself
Where do we go from here?

It seems so all too near
Just as far beyond as I can see
I still don't know what this all means to me

You tell yourself
I have nowhere to go
I don't know what to do
And I don't even know the time of day
I guess it doesn't matter any way
Life is so strange
