It doesn't hurt me, do you wanna feel how it feels
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me
Do you wanna hear about the deal I'm making
You, it's you and me

And if I only could, I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road, be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say if I only could, oh

You don't wanna hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
