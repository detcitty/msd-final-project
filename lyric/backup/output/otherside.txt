How long, how long will I slide
Separate my side
I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slittin' my throat

It's all I ever
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back

I've got to take it on the otherside
Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I married a thief
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
