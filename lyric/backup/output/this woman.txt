Well, she walks like you
In so many ways
It's a different look
Different time of day

One look in her eyes
How can I make you understand
She's the one good thing
That's happened in so many years
There's been so many tears
Since we lost the dream
And the winter came

And you said goodbye
And I don't want another reason to cry

You be all you wanna be
You got the longest night
Baby, you'd be alone
I share my dream with someone else
I don't wanna talk about her

This woman
She's tearing my world apart
