Cheat the odds that made you brave to try to gamble at times
Well I feel like dirty laundry sending sickness on down the line
Tell you why

'Cause I'm jealous, jealous again
Thought it time I let you in
Yeah, I'm jealous, jealous again
Got no time, baby

Always drunk on Sunday, trying to feel like I'm at home
Smell the gasoline burning, boys out feeling nervous and cold
Oh yeah
