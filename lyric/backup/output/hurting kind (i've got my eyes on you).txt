She's the girl of my dreams
She's the girl on my mind
She's used to play me for the fool
'Cause she's the hurting kind

I lost my heart in the East
Another part in the West
You better jump back, baby
You're the girl I love the best

I'm gonna ride the wind
There's nothing I won't do
I'm coming up real fast
I got my eyes on you

See you're eyes of love
Well tell me what you see
I see your long black hair
