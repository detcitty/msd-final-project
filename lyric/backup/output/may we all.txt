May we all get to grow up in our red white and blue little town
Get a one star hand me down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
Cause you miss it too much

May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new one
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
