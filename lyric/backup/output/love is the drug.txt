It ain't no big thing to wait for the bell to ring
It ain't no big thing the toll of the bell

Aggravated spare for days
I troll down town, the red light place
Jump up bubble up, what's in store
Love is the drug and I need to score

Showing out, showing out hit and run
Boy meets girl where the beat goes on
