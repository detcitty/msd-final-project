Things get a little easier
Once you understand
Things get a little easier
Once you understand... 

I'll be expecting you to
Get a haircut by Friday
(Forget it, Dad)
(That won't change anything)
Forget nothing, you'll do as I say
As long as you're living in my house

He knows I'm not feeling well
And yet he doesn't take one
Second out to help his mother
His only concern is for himself

(Come on, Ma)
(What do you want from me)
Don't argue with your mother
Just shut up and listen

But, Mom, all my
Friends will be there
(I said, no, you can't go)
But why
