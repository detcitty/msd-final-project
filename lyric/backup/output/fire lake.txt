Who's goin' to ride that chrome 3-wheeler?
Who's goin' to make that first mistake
Who wants to wear those gypsy leather
All the way to Fire Lake

Who wants to break the news about Uncle Joe?
You remember Uncle Joe
He was the one afraid to cut the cake

Who wants to tell poor Aunt Sarah?
Joe's run off to Fire Lake
