Give me an inch
I promise I'll take a mile
Danger is beauty
I'll face it with a smile

I'm on a mission
With no restrictions
Don't second guess myself
I'm born to be wild

I'm the type of chick
That likes to rock the beat
I like to rock the beat
I like to rock, to rock the beat

21st Century Girl
I do what I like
21st Century Girl
I'm taking you for a ride
21st Century Girl
Yeah, I'm gonna live it up
Just live it up

21st Century Girl
A beautiful life
