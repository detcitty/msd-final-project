So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot then we can die
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, "Don't you know?"
You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
I say, "You don't show"
Don't move time is slow
