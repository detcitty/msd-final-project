You're my love, you're my sweetest thing
Don't shy away, don't shy away
Every night makes me hate the days
Can't get enough of your love
Am I wrong? Am I so unkind?
Show me the way, don't turn away
I can't hide all these thoughts in my mind
Every moment I'm thinking of you
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
You know what I'm looking for
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
I'll give you love you can't ignore
