Welcome to the world, welcome to the world

You got your pop star, I'll be your rock star
When it's a suicide, you call it superstar
Check out the forecast, predictions won't stop
You get your fifteen and then they take the spot

Let's go, let's go
And then you're ready to go
Let's go, let's go
'Cause it's the end of the show

Let's go, let's go
So just get ready to go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go

All the time that you were gone
I thought about how things went wrong
