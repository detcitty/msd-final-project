Uh
Nextselection

You've been waiting so long
I'm here to answer your call
I know that I shouldn't have
Had you waiting at all
I've been so busy
But I've been thinking 'bout
What I wanna do with you

I know them other guys
They've been talking 'bout
The way I do what I do
They heard I was good
They wanna see if it's true

They know you're the one
I wanna give it to
I can see you want me too
Now it's me and you

It's me and you, now
Uh, I've been waitin' (waitin')
Think I'm gonna make that move now
Baby tell me if you like it (tell me if you like it)
