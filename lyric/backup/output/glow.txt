Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Time to shake the dice, time to change the light
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersize
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y
We so certified, we so certified
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I
They gon' bang this here all summertime
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
