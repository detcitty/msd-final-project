Linda lost a lover
In the early part of autumn
And she moved out to the country
Hoping all would be forgotten

The last time that I saw her
She was makin' sure the winter
Wouldn't come through that old door frame
Where the door is several inches
From the ground, the cold hard ground

And it's hard to go down easy
