Empty rooms without a view
And empty space to see it through
Blow by blow my first mistake
Fast hearts begin to make

[Chorus]
You never said that you'd change your mind
Never said you could
You never said that you'd need me back
If it's love you want
Let the feeling go
Follow your heart
So the story goes
If there's time for us
