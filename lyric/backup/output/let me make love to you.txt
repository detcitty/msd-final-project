Just, just, just, just
Let me make love to you, baby

I won't hurt, I won't hurt
I'll treat you ever so gentle
I'll make every little thing alright
Honey, you'll never forget this night

Just let me make love to you, baby
I'll be good, I'll be better then better
Neater than neater
Sweeter than sweeter
