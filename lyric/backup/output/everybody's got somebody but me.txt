I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room
Seems like everyone around me is on their honey moon
I'd love to take a pin to a heart shaped balloon
Everybody's got somebody but me

I don't know how I landed on this movie set
It's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'
I never would have noticed if we'd never met
But everybody's got somebody but me

And I miss you
Without you I just don't fit in
