For a while, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
And our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For a while, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night somethin' right
Would invite us to begin the dance

Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Somethin' happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

And oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
