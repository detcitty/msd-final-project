Just blaze, yeah, check me out now
Yo, yo, yo, check me out now
Yo, yo, yo, let me hear ya say
Uh, huh, uh, huh, uh, huh
Put your hands in the air everybody, c'mon
Where them dogs at

Hey yo, I'm immaculate, come through masculine
Wide-body frame, E-Dub's the name, whoa
In the field of rap, I'm supurb, I'm fly
I should be in the sky with birds

I ride 20 inch rims when I lean, yo
Hey yo, them tens, nigga
I know, I keep 'em clean though
Come through stormin' the block like El Nino

Scoop up an Arabic chick before she close
She goes, those my people
Yeah, them broads from Puerto Rico, them Keith's folks
Yeah, watch how the 'E' locs 64

Black rags, black interior, shift on the floor
Burn out, I do it for the kids
They're hoppin' the turn style, the 'E' goin' wild
