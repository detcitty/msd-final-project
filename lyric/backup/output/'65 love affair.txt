I was a car hop
You were into be-bop
You sang do wop diddy wop diddy wop doo
All of them changes you put me through

If I could go back again
Well, I know I'd never let you go
Back with all of my friends
To that wonderful

'65 Love Affair
We wasn't gettin' nowhere
But we didn't care
It was a crazy
'65 Love Affair
