Your arms don't go around me, when I reach out for you
And your eyes don't hold the fire, that they once used to do
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Tell me... we are through...
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Little signs of distance, (little signs of distance)
Tell me... I'm losing you
