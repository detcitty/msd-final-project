I'm facing the bottle
For all of my problems
These Instagram models
Are nothing but trouble
She's going away now
I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble

Uh, when I met her she was out for love
Yeah, I bought her leather and some diamond studs
Damn, when I met her she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I said "Whatever" cause I'm not a judge
No, all my niggas say she's not what's up
Uh, I considered it but not enough
Uh, she just wanted to be popular
Uh, she just wanted ten thousand followers
Oh, she posted, she posted, she posted
