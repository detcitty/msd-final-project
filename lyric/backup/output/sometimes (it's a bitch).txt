Well, I've run through rainbows
And castles of candy
I've cried a river of tears
From the pain

I try to dance with
What life has to hand me
My partner's been pleasure
My partner's been pain

There are days
When I swear I could
Fly like an eagle
And dark desperate hours
That nobody sees

My arms stretched triumphant
On top of the mountain
My head in my hands
Down on my knees

Sometimes it's a bitch
Sometimes it's a breeze
