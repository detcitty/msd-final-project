(Because of you)

I used to walk home all alone
It used to be so sad
I used to be all by myself
It used to be so bad

(Until you)
You came along
And took me by the hand
(Until you)
You came along
And said that you would be my man

Now I'm jumpin' up and down
Spinnin' all around
Because of you babe (babe babe)

I'm as happy as can be
And it's definitely
Because of you babe
Just because of you

I used to go to bed at night
Wishin' I had a friend
Someone to hold and squeeze me tight
A very special friend (friend, friend)

(Until you)
You came along
And told me you would be the one
