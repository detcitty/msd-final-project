I've been here too long
There's a big world out there
I wanna know how it feels
South American, begin
To the rhythm of the street
When I catch his eye
Under Brazilian sky
Body and soul will meet
We will be lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
We will be lovers, imagine
Dancing under a Latin moon
