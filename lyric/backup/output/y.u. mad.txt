I am the female Weezy, this shit is easy
Pull up in that new new, bitch get a squeegee
Yeah my flow sick, yeah my flow queasy
Haha, they were sleeping on me, z-zz-zz
This pussy clean, this pussy squeaky
That pussy old, that pussy creaky
When I'm out the country, niggas call me Neeki
Hi, how are you? Yes, it's nice to meet me
Damn, Billboard, I mean I'm winning but I'm still bored
Yeah we shine, gold cluster
As for your career, dead. Ghost Busters

That's why you mad
That's why you why you mad mad
That's why you mad
That's why you why you mad mad
That's why you mad
