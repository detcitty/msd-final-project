How long you gonna carry on
This one on one charade
Lets don't and then say we did
That's the game you like to play.

Weve been through this so many times
The end results always the same
I always end up complaining
When I've got myself to blame.

You're just a dead giveaway
You'dthink I'd learn to handle this by now
You're just a dead giveaway.

Girl you can't deny it
