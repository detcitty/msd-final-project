Maybe it's too late but
This feelin' is runnin' through my soul
I think I've learned what love is
But I'm afraid I let it go

Maybe it's too late
Maybe you've already changed your mind
Turned lovin' into leavin'
And I'm on the outside

You can't take these words
To bed with you
And hold onto them at night
They can't erase the emptiness
And make everything all right

But your laughter and your tenderness
Will never disappear
No matter where you are tonight
A part of you is here with me

Here with me
I don't know where you are
All I know is I need you to be

Here with me
I know it's not too late
