Come on, come on, let's make a baby
Oh, baby, come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's bring another life into this world
A little boy, a little girl

Take my hand while we walk slowly to the room
Can't you see tonight I'm gonna make sweet, sweet love to you?

Girl, don't be shy, don't be shy
This is a moment we've been waiting for
Hey, come by my side, by my side
It's the place you'll be forever more, forever more

So, baby, come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's make a baby
Oh, baby, come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's bring another life into this world
A little boy, a little girl

I want my baby to have shiny eyes like you
I hope and pray that he smiles the same way you do

Hey, don't be shy, don't be shy
Let's be fruitful and multiply
Come by my side, by my side
It's the place you'll be forever more, forever more

I said, come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's have this baby
Oh, baby, come on, come on
(Come on, come on)
Let's bring another life into this world
A little boy, a little girl

Let's put wisdom in his head
So he'll never look back, he'll look straight ahead
We'll teach him the truth and understand the meaning of it all
So he can walk around with his head held tall
