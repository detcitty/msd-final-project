Snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yourself

Baby girl, what's your name
Let me talk to ya, let me buy a drank
I'm soMo, you know me
Konvict Muzik Nappy Boy ooo wee

What's the chances of you rollin' wit me?
Back to the crib, show ya how I live
Let's get drunk'n forget what we did

I'ma buy you a drank
Then, I'ma take you home with me
I got the money in the bank
Shawty whachu think 'bout that
