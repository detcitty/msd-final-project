Love's comin' at ya
(My love's comin' at ya)
Love's comin' at ya
(My love's comin' at ya)
I couldn't get over
The first time I saw your face
I knew I had to have you
My heart said there is no to wait
I want your love, won't ya
Give it to me, baby
I need your love
Every day I've got to have it
Love's comin' at ya
(My love's comin' at ya)
Straight on and full speed ahead
Love's comin' at ya
(My love's comin' at ya)
Gonna make you mine, all mine
I keep anticipating
The nights we'll make sweet, sweet love
Oh, can't stand the waiting
