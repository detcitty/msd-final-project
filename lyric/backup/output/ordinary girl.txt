Uh, oh, oh, yeah, mmm
La, da, da

Don't get me wrong, I love who I am
I don't wanna be ungrateful
It probably sounds strange
I really love the role I play
The songs I sing, but with all the fame

The things that seem so simple
Suddenly, it's so far out of reach
Wish that they could see that underneath
I'm just an ordinary girl

Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored
I get scared, I feel ignored
I feel happy, I get silly
I choke on my own words
