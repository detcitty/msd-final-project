They get up every morning
From the alarm clock's warning
Take the 8: 15 into the city
There's a whistle up above
And people pushing, people shoving
And the girls who try to look pretty

And if your train's on time
You can get to work by nine
And start your slaving job to get your pay
If you ever get annoyed
Look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

And I've been takin' care of business
Every day
Takin' care of business
Every way

I've been takin' care of business
It's all mine
Takin' care of business
And working overtime
Work out
If it were easy as fishin'

You could be a musician
If you could make sounds loud or mellow
