At Seventeen We Fell in Love
Highschool Sweethearts, Love Was So Brand New
We Took the Vows of Man and Wife
Forever, For Life
I Remember How We Made Our Way
A Little Patience, the Time We Pray

Can't Imagine That This Love Is Through
Feelin' the Pain, Girl When You Lose
Ot It's Too Hot, Too Hot, Lady
Gotta Run For Shelter
Gotta Run For Shade
