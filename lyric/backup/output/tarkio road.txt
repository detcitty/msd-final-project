Moving on down the Tarkio Road
Headed up to Crete, Nebraska
Trying my best to set the highway on fire
But my bicycle won't go no faster

Tarkio Road is a mother
It's just like, oh, so many others
Well, the children reject you
And the police inspect you

Looking inside the trunk
Under the hood, hoping to find
The secret places where you
Always keep your mind
Whoa, whoa, no, Tarkio Road

Having a room or lying in jail
