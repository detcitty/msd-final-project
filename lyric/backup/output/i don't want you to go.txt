Monday mornin' is such a rush
Here it is again sneakin' up on us
Uh-huh-huh, yeah

This is the part you know I don't like
We say goodbye and then we kiss goodnight
Uh-huh-huh, yeah

I know it's one o'clock
And we said you'd be gone by ten
So much for those eight hours
I swore that I'd get in

I know I should get some sleep
I'm at the beginnin' of another long week
But I don't want you to go
No, I don't want you to go
