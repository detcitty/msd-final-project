Well let's begin with the day I met her
How fast this good old boy's world got better
Sky got bluer, the grass got greener
Just the first few seconds after I first seen her

Like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and my broke in sneakers
A home run pitch floating right down the middle
The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle
