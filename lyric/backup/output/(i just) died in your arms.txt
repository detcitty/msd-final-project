Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this
