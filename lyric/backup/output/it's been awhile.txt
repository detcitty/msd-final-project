It's been awhile, since I could
Hold my head up high
And it's been awhile,
Since I first saw you.

And it's been awhile,
since I could stand, on my own two feet again.
And it's been awhile.

And everything I can remember,
As fucked up as it all may seem.
The consequences that are rendered,
I've stretched myself beyond my means.

And it's been awhile,
Since I could say,
