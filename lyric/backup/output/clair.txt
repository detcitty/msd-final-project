Clair
The moment I met you, I swear.
I felt as if something, somewhere
Had happened to me
which I couldn't see.
And then, the moment I met you, again.
I knew in my heart
that we were friends.
It had to be so
it couldn't be no.
But try as hard as I might do
I don't know why.
You get to me in a way
I can't describe.
Words mean so little
