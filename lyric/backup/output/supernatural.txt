Supernatural love, Supernatural

Love like a river,
Flowing deeper than time
Rushing over my senses,
Like sweet cherry wine

Stole my emotion,
Like a thief in the night
Love made me an offer,
I couldn't deny

You raise me up until I can't see the ground
Wanna tell the whole world about this love that I found

Chorus:
Supernatural love
You're giving me
Supernatural high
Oh keep on giving me
Heaven sent from above
