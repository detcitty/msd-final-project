Okay, here we go

Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song
And I want y'all to sing along, sing along

See this is the way that we walk on a sunny, day
When it's rainin' inside
And you're, all alone, all alone, yeah

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)

And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)
And the whole world loves it when you sang the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah, bah-da da)

Take a little trip, hater, pack up yo' mind
Look forward, not behind then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought, he could rhyme
Now, if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime

I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use
Abbreviation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck

See, ain't nuttin' changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you is what I'm forced to do
