Sombody call 9-1-1
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor, woh-oha
(Fire burning)
What a guann?
(Fire burning)
Kingston

Let's Go, hey (Hey, hey)
Red One (Hey)
Hey, Hey (Hey)
Shawty got that super thing
Hotter than the sun of South of Spain
Got me soon as I walked through the door, oha
My pocket started tickle-ing
The way she dropped it low that thang
Got me wanna spend my money on her, her
She get it popping

Like they're dropping that birthday cake
Got a candle, need to blow that crazy flame away
Now take my red, black cord and my jewelery
Shawty is cool like the fire
