Cannot know, cannot know
Cannot know, cannot know
Cannot know, cannot know
Cannot know
Under a lover's sky
Gonna be with you

And no one's gonna be around
You think that you won't fall
Well, just wait until

Til the sun goes down
Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling so right
It'll steal your heart tonight
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart

But you know but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
