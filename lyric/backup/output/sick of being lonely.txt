[verse 1]
little shawty, we used to be on the phone all day
talkin' to the sunshine shinin' on my bald head
now today seem strange
no call on my celly, no name on my caller id
callin' you up and ya ogs sayin' you ain't home
what's really goin' on? i wanna know
so gimme a call and let's play no games
i'm playin', you want the plane
don't point a finger over herre
i bought you a fur coat for your birthday
and this the things i get shorty?
over there you starin' mad
that i went out with them other chicks
i told you they ain't shit!
they were just some buddies from high school that i went to
where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em
but i called you up but you wasn't home
