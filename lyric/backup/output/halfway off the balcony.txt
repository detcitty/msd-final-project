I am ready right now
Uh huh
I look up, I don't even...
I think it's funny how it go down
I don't even know no more
Official shit

I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

I'm the livin' proof that you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed
My daddy tell me, "Stay strong, son and be the man you have to be
Holdin' shit down, don't crash at sea"
Brrrr Paper on my phone line
It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me
