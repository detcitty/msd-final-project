My heart skips-skips-skips-skips-skips-skips a beat.
Olly Murs, Chiddy Bang
Them girls make your heart skip like like

I can see, you're not yourself
Even when you're here, with me
I know that you're some, where else

So put another record on
Kiss and leave me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
'Cause every time we come this close, my heart skips, skips a beat

So come on, spin me around
