Somewhere out in the back of your mind (somewhere)
Comes your real life and the life that you know
It seems like it was the creation of some of those same old things
It seemed to be the only thing left out in the light

She had trusted many
But been unfamiliar with
Almost everyone but you

Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Every time that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself
