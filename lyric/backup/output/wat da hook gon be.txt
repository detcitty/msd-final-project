Yo, yo, yo, yo, you never met a n*** like me
Yo, yo, have you ever seen a little dude
Who be doin' what I do? Yo, let's get at it, dog

Now what goes up, must come down
But we ain't comin' down, it be them same ole' clowns
Aimin' your pound, pretendin' they proud
But when you leave town, they go around runnin' they mouth

They somethin' like a hater, man
Talkin' bad about a playa as if I'm not gon' see you later, man
You constantly frontin' until you confronted on
If you don't like what's goin' on, go on to another song

'Cause I keep a hater guilty
My cars an' my money all alike, man, both them filthy
From skimpy an' empty to fuel on full
See I be h*** when my 'Ca-go Bulls

Obey no rules to school you fools
Schoolboy's err'y where, we're Young Dude news
St. Louis like Blues, D. Miles an' Larry Hughes
An' the Young Dude done paid young dudes' dues, dude

But yo, what da hook gon be?
See I don't need no f*** hook on this beat
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the b*** goin 'round an' I'ma rip

Yo, what da hook gon be?
See I don't need no f*** hook on this beat
