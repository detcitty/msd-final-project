I feel like I just seen the sun for the first time
You make my life bright cause you shine
It's me and you baby, it's our time
I'm living my dream, girl cause you mine
You got me skippin down the street
And singin love songs all out of key
I didn't smoke nothin but I feel so high
And I know why
It's a love thing, it's got to be
Your heart's all locked and I got the key
It feels like I just won the lottery
Cause I got my girl and she got me

You my new obsession
All I want to do
You my new obsession, girl

I feel on top of the world with you baby
I want to dance and party tonight
I feel on top of the world with my lady
I'm gonna rock your body all night
She makes me wanna sing
