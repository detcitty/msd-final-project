The visions dancing in my mind
The early dawn, the shades of time
Twilight crawling through my windowpane.

Am I awake or do I dream?
The strangest pictures I have seen
Night is day and twilight's gone away.

With your head held high and your scarlet lies
You came down to me from the open skies
It's either real or it's a dream
