We're through being cool
We're through being cool

Eliminate the ninnies and the twits
Going to bang some heads
Going to beat some butts
Time to show those evil spuds what's what

If you live in a small town
You might meet a dozen or two
Young alien types who step out
And dare to declare

We're through being cool
We're through being cool
