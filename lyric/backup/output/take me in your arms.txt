I know you're leavin', leavin' me behind
I'm seein' you darlin' for the very last time
Show a little tenderness mama before you go
Please let me feel your embrace once more

Take me in your arms
(Rock me, rock me a little while)
Oh little darling
(Rock me, rock me a little while)

We all must feel heartache sometimes
Right now, right now I'm feelin' mine

I've tried my best to be strong, but I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child left in a cradle
Before you leave me, mama leavin' far behind
Please let me feel happy one more time
