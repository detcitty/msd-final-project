Boogie fever
Got to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby to the drive in show
She turned the speaker down
And then she turned on the radio
I watched a silent movie, diggin' funky sound

She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby too the pizza parlor
