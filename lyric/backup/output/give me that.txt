(Oh) Girl give me that
(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that
Girl give me that (pussy)
(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that
Girl give me that (pussy)
(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that there
Girl give me that pussy
(Oh Oh Oh) Girl give me that

You know you want it
Girl don't act like you don't want it
Girl I want it just as bad as you do
And look see I can tell from this lil vibe
You got me feeling that you dig me
Boo I'm digging you too
You wanna be one of the chosen few
Then gon jig up in this motherfucker
Maybe me and you can do it big up in this motherfucker
Sit you in a crib where you can chill
Don't have to move a muscle
Give you some be good now you be good
Daddy gon hustle
Come here let me Whisper in your ear
I gotta tell you something
Listening to this song kinda make a nigga want something
Did some daydreaming
Now I'm fiending like I'm on something
Girl don't hold it from me
Cause right now I'll be don strong on ya
I ain't the type to ruin your life
By running game and throwing your dreams
Get in your brain suit your game
Ease your pain and show you things
Sit you on some leather seats while blowing green
And switching lanes
Girl stop playing games let me beat it out the frame
