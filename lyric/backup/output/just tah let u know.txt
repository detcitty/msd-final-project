Eazy-e
Str8 Off Tha Streetz Of Muthaphukkin Compton
Just Tah Let U Know
... ... ... ... (keeps on repeating)

one:

It's that man comin up from that land of tha c-p-t
("what's my motherfuckin name?" - snoop) eazy-e
Comin thru with a big lick for '94
Showin alla y'all them true-ass gangsta flows
So bow-wow bow-wow the big dog's in town
And them guts is the only thing a nigga pound
Laid back as i blow a fat sack
Hittin switches for them bitches, hittin corners in a cadillac
So take a ride on tha ruthless side
With the e to the a-z-y
That nigga makin more off yo hits than you do
You fools, need to recognize this crew when i roll through
