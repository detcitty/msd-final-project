I don't want nobody else
To mess with you
I don't want nobody else
To dance with you
You think you're cute just
'Cause you dance with my bro
But you ain't seen nothin'
Baby, I'm gonna get my dancing shoes
'Cause I'm crazy about ya
Got that sparkle in your eyes
And I need your sweet reaction
Just a little bit more
