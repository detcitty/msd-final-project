says the fight began
somewhere in the Middle East.

There's a single mom
just got laid off when she lost a job
to some foreign hands
in some faraway land.

some twister took thirteen
and they're praying that they find
the missing three.
God must be busy.

That highway sign
went from slow ahead
to traffic's dead.
Thought it couldn't get worse
than that Amber Alert.
