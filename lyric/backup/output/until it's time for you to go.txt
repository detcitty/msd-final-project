(Buffy Sainte-Marie)

[Intro by Harvey Fuqua & Honey Cone's Carolyn Willis:]
Honey? Honey?
Yeah?
It's time.
I know. But it's been so nice.
Yeah, it has been groovy.
But there's something I have to tell you first
And it's a long story.

[Lead vocals by Susaye Greene:]
You're not a king
You're not an angel
You're a man

I'm not a queen
I'm a woman
Please take my hand

We'll make a space
