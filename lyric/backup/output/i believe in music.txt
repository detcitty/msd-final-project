Well, I could just sit around
Makin' music all day long
Long as I'm makin' music
I know I couldn't do nobody wrong

And who knows, maybe someday
I'll come up with a song
It makes people want to stop
All their fussin' and fightin'
Just long enough to sing along

I believe in music, I believe in love
