Friends are like music
Sometimes they're sad, sometimes they're lonely
And need to be told that they're loved
Everyone needs to be loved

Friends are like good wine
And I've had the best
I don't always show it
But no one knows better than I

So drink up
I'm a homesick old sailor
Who longs for the sound
Of my own front door
