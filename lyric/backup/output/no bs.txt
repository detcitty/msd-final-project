3 in the morning
You know I'm horny
So why don't you come over my place
Put a smile on my face
Leaving the club
Shawty hurry up
So we can this party started
Take off your clothes, now
You already know what time it is
Reach up in the dresser where the condoms is
Baby, when I get it, I'll never let it go
Gonna take it slow

We ain't gon stop 'til 9 AM
If you can't take it all, baby say when
Make you come over and over again
And I'ma leave it in

When we do it, all night
We can do it, all night
Girl I'ma give it to you, all night
