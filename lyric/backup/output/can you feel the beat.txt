Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart? That beat in my heart

After all that we've been through
I can't seem to face the fact that boy I'm losing you
I threw away your ties through those venetian blinds
I looked and saw my heart just over ruled my mind

And I tried not to let it show now I don't know what to do
I tell myself I'm lying so let's just not let it go
My heart does double beats for you, oh

Now you know my love won't grow cold
Oh this love will turn to gold if we stay in love
Oh, my love, my love, my love

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
