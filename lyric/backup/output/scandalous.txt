So so so scandalous

You know you wanna sing with us
That's why you know you should be scared of us

Nice vibe - looks to kill
Straight talk - sex appeal
One touch - gives me chills
And we ain't even close yet

Ruffneck - all around
Ain't been all over town
Show me how you get down
Cause we ain't even close yet

You've got me feenin' and you got me feeling weak
Listen as I speak cause I'm careful as I creep
You got me going crazy and you know I can't sleep
Love watching ya moves and you hypnotize me
You got me trembling like a little baby girl
You're so special
You're like diamonds and pearls
You got me spinning and you got me in a twirl
You're my number one baby and you've come to rock my world
You're dangerous - just get it off

The way you move - so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation baby
