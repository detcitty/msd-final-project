Sometimes I get my head in a dizzy
Feeling so lost, ticking you off
Now boy, you know me well
Said, IÂm that kind of feeling
That kind of soft, that kind of silly
But when IÂm in doubt, I open my mouth
And words come out, words come out like

Baby, thereÂs a shark in the water
ThereÂs something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe I said
Baby, thereÂs a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon
