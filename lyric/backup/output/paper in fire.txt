She had a dream
And boy it was a good one
So she chased after her dream
With much desire

But when she got too close
To her expectations
Well the dream burned up
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Smokin' up the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder
Like paper in fire
