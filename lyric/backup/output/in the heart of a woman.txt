She is all I ever could've wanted her to be
She always knew just how to give the best of love to me
I thought I knew a thing or two about the ways of love
But it was soon to become so clear I didn't know enough
One day I found a note beside the ring she'd left behind
She said that here is all you need to know for better love next time

Say your love is strong and true
Let her know all she meant to you
Show her she's that special one
Who shines in your eyes like the rising sun
Give love less room to grow
Treat her tender and you will know
The secret to the treasures of heaven
