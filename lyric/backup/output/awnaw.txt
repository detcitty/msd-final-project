[Hook]
Awnaw! Hell naw! Man
Y'all went up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Boy
Y'all went up and done it
Awnaw! Hell naw! Man
Y'all went up and done it
Y'all went up and done it man
Y'all went up and done it

[Fish Scales]
My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hook
You hear me flippin thru my pages out my favorite notebook
The microphone was in the closet (What?) No headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler, (Heeeyy man!)
all play flirtin all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin blacks out on the back po'ch
I'm thinkin I got everything a country boy can ask for

[Big V]
Now what we do to get here? (Say dat boy!)
