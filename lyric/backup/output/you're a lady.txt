Now the year has come to a close
And I've had my last dance with you
Unto the empty streets we go
And this might be my last chance with you

So I might as well get it over
'Cause the things I've got to say won't wait until another day

You're a lady
I'm a man
You're supposed to understand
How these things are often planned to be
