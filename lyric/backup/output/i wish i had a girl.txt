Wooow, hey
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

You can have your Cajun queens
Down in New Orleans
And take the movie stars
Who drive impress me more cars

Take your high class show and tell
Don't need no modern day Jezebel
All I want, ain't no lie
Check it out, Leroy
They breeze by

Wish I had a girl who
Walked like that, ooh, yeah
Wish I had that girl, uh huh
Wish I had a girl who
Walked like that, yeah
Wish I had that girl, yeah

That's it, that's it, ha ha
