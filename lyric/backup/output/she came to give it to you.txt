Said it ain't what you do cause
(Everybody knows what's up cause everybody wanna get next to me)
Said if you knew what I do, she'll be yours tonight
Imagine she came here to get away
Well she don't want nobody crowding her space
Wouldn't that be weird? Aw yeah
She was up tonight to get down
But she don't wanna be a part of the crowd
Wouldn't that be weird? Aw yeah

I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

Said It ain't what you do, its what you do tonight
And there ain't no shortcut, to doing something right
If you knew what I knew, she'll be yours tonight
Just look around the club cuz, you're here to have a good time

So many benefits to to being quiet, just be cool enjoy the ride
â€˜Cause all you really wanna do is, wouldn't that be weird? Yeah
Don't be stingy with it pass the J, let her hit it if it's headed her way
My nigga, that's weird
(You don't let her hit it, you don't let her hit it)
