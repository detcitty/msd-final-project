I'm not strong enough
Just to smile
And make things easy
I can't put on that
Brave face anymore

I always took it for granted
That I could take
Whatever you gave me
I guess you never
Really know for sure

Cause there was never
A doubt in my mind
How it was meant to be
So who do I turn to, darling
If you should leave me
