Hoo... baby
Oh... baby
Yeah... hey...
Whoa...
Doo doo doo doo doo
No, no, no, no, no

I'm stayin' home tonight
I don't wanna go nowhere
I'm just gonna love you, baby
All night long

I wanna rub your back and kiss your feet
Romantically I wanna be yours, baby
All night long

Girl, you hold the key to my soul
(It's obvious I need you)
Oh, anything you want is yours
(I'll go outta my way to please you)

Girl, I wanna show you love
Romance you till you get enough (Oh)
Oh, baby, now let's stay home tonight
(Can't you see that-that I need you, baby)
