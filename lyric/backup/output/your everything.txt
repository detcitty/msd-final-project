The first time I looked in your eyes, I knew
That I would do anything for you
The first time you touched my face, I felt
What I'd never felt, with anyone else

I wanna give back what you've given to me
And I wanna witness all of your dreams
Now that you've shown me, who I really am
I wanna be more than, just your man

I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
