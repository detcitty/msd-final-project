It's Young Khalifa man
2 Chainz!

Money's the motivation,
Money's the conversation,
You on vacation, we gettin' paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eye closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You use plastic, we 'bout cash,
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!

I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am,
Only God can judge me, now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, Ima go for it,
This moment, we own it
A I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
