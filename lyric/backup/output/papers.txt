Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers
I can't, get to work on time

Can't believe the words to her I just said
But who the hell argue 'n' fight
Like dogs at 6 in the morning? (in the mornin)
I know it's gonna be some more shit tonight
Our pastor's callin', tellin' me
I done went too far in
I'm seen around town
And my friends can't recognize me
'Cuz I took a chance on love (love)
It's like (like)
I'm dyin' (Ooh dyin')
For you I gave my heart

And turned my back against the world
'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl
I done damn near lost my mama
I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man
That I never thought I'd be.
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers

I done took all I can take
But you leave me no options girl
I can't deny how much I love you
I done gave up errthing I had to
