Those times I waited for you seemed so long ago
I wanted you far too much to never let you go
You never know I never got by "I feel it too"
Well I guess I could never stand to lose
It's such a pity to say

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you

Could I ever love someone like the one I see in you
I remember the good times baby now
And the bad times too
These last few weeks of holding on,
The days are dull, the nights are long
So I guess it's better to say
