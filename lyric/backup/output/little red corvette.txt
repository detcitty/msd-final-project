I guess I should've known by the way
You parked your car sideways that it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast

I guess I must be dumb
'Cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "What have I got to lose?"

And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

I guess I should've closed my eyes
When you drove me to the place where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me

Believe it or not, I started to worry
