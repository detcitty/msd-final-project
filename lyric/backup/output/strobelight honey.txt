(Verse One: Dres)

I skipped the line, I paid my dime
I hung my coat, and now it's time
To move to the forefront take my rounds
Say peace and give a pound have a drink, get down
I'm on the floor, besides the door
The sound is rich, and I ain't poor
I'm looking for Susie or Wendy or Judy
But look at her (repeat 3X) "Who me?"
Yes, you sweetie, although it's hard to see thee
I see your silhouette and what I see has got me needy
I need you for a second of your time
But then I reckon that a second is too short let me try
"You're slammin!"
But anyway, I'd like to say
I'm Dres of the Black Sheep givin you play
Step out in the light, come show off yourself
Yo, I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else.

(Chorus: Dres, Strobelite Hoe)
