Well, there's one thing
I'd like to rearrange
But after everything's already happened
And there's nothing left to change

They can take their advice
And use it all on themselves
Cause when all the talking stops
I want to have something else

I want to have a little faith
I want to know what a guy and a girl
Can do when they're dizzy
Cause they're just not
Spinning with this world
