I'm sleeping
and right in the middle
of a good dream
And all at once I wake up
from something that keeps knocking at my brain

Before I go insane
I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed
screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you
(I think I love you)

This morning
I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with
and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself
