Yeah, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, yeah
Sometimes I walk a little faster
In the school hallway just to get next to you
Some days I spend a little extra time
In the morning just to impress you
Guess you don't notice, guess you don't need this
Sad, you're not seeing what you're missing
On the outside shying away
On the inside dying to say
I'm unusual, not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
