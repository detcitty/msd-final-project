Go on and close the curtains
'Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me, and a bottle of wine
To hold you tonight (oh)

Well we know I'm going away
And how I wish, I wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
And let's delay our misery

Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
Save tonight and fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be gone
