One, two
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I threw a party would you be there
Would you bring your friends too
'Cause why should we stay at home
When there's something better to do
Let's started in the house
And move it to the street
Come on and follow me
And have some fun with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
This party's gonna pump
Bebop and body bump
Let's have some fun with the funk
Turn up the bass and pop the trunk
