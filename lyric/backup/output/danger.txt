*Oh my God* [Q-Tip]
*When The East is in the house* [Jeru The Damaja]

Put out the word Blahzay has emerged
Surged, most prefered from the verbs and words
I finesse, try your best to diagnose
when I host, you gettin' roast, toast
Bet grip bra when I rumble, you crumble
My stuff is good like mo dumgoe
soup. Rappers getting suit front and rugged
but i don't plug it, when my semantics hit your nugget
and expose, you know how it goes when it be gritty
when we roll is like we got the key to the city
it won't be pretty for you to challenge,
