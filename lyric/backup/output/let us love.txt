On just an old ordinary day
No reason, no reason for a fuss
But even though it isn't Christmas
Let us love one another, let us love

On just a day, just a day
No special name, no pretty presents
Pretty presents to exchange
Make it a good day just the same
Let us love one another, let us love, yeah

No special greeting, special greeting for today
No Happy Easter, no Merry Christmas
Only how are you today
Make it a good day anyway

Let us help one another
Help your neighbor
He's your brother

Let us love, let us love
