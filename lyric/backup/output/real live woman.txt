I don't buy the lines in magazines
That tell me what I've gotta be
I don't base my life on a movie screen
I don't fit the mold society has planned

I don't need to be 19 years old
Or starve myself for some weight I'm told
Or turn men's heads down that road
And I thank God I finally know just who I am

I ain't a movie star may never see the view from where they are
