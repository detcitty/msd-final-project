In your arms I can still feel the way you want me when you hold me
I can still hear the words you whispered when you told me
I can stay right here forever in your arms

And there ain't no way - I'm letting you go now
And there ain't no way - and there ain't no how
I'll never see the day

â€˜Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face - always
