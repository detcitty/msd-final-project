House of fire
House of fire, yeah

Let's build a house of fire, baby
Not one of wood or stone
Walk through my door of desire, baby
Come on in and make it your home

Don't need a window to watch you, baby
Don't need no roof overhead
Don't need no key to unlock you, baby
I'll use my lovin' instead

I won't tire
