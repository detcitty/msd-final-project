If you want to get to where you let the feeling roll
Get down to your rockin' soul
Rock down on the inside
If you want to get to where you let the feeling roll
Get down to your rockin' soul
Each day I feel so much closer to you
But we both got to keep the lovin' comin' on through
'Cause when the train of thought gets off the track
The engineer, naturally, starts pullin' back
