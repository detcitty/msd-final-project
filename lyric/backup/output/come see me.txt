Baby you can come see me 'cuz I need you here with me
And I'll show you what love is made of
Later on if you are free, baby you can come see me
And I'll show you what love is made of

It's been a while and I'm sitting here thinking of
How it felt when we first made love
Oh I need that feeling again
Nobody can compare, so

Come with me and I'll go with you
To this place that lovers dream of
We can do anything, sexy things
And I'm here to let you know

Baby you can come see me 'cuz I need you here with me
