Hello everybody
Welcome today to the wonderful world of you
Now check it, you have two options
You can eat it or throw it away

See it's a shame that when you're working on doing well
People hate you, yeah
Buying nothing that's not the best for yourself
Then they really hate you, yeah

You gotta live for you and no one else
Don't let 'em make you feel
Like you're not being real
Just live how you wanna live
You gotta do for you

Dig that
If you work hard then play hard
Dig that
And do what you wanna do

Dig that
Just pop ya collar
Don't let what people say bother you

Dig that
You perpetrators I got something to say
Dig that
You can eat it or throw it away

Dig that
You're just mad 'cause you're
Following in my trap
But can you dig that?

Hey ladies, hey fellas
You know you're doing good 'cause they jealous
