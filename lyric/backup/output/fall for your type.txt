Can I, can I save you from you?
'Cause you notice something missing
And that champagne you've been sipping
I suppose to make you different all the time

Is starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, girl
'Cause with all the recognition
It gets hard for you to listen to the things
That I'm gonna say to make you mine

But live girl, have some fun, girl
We'll be fine
Tryin' to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from

I swear I always fall for your type, yeah
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type
For your type
