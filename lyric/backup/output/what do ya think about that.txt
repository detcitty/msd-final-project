I heard it through the grapevine
My new neighbor don't like my big red barn
A '47 Ford, bullet holes in the door
Broke down motor in the front yard

I got a half a mind to paint a plywood sign
And nail it up on a knotty pine tree
Saying I was here first, this is my piece of dirt
And your rambling don't rattle me

Some people care about what other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip coming from a loose lip
Ruin a perfect day
