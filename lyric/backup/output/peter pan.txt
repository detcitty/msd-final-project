The smile, the charm, the words, the spark
Everything, you had it
I guess I had a naive heart, cause boy
I let you have it
You said I was your only
I never thought you'd leave me lonely

You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground

You're always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
You're never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
