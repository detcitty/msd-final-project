This is David Nevermind
And today's controversy is coming from yet another member
(Aiyyo tell 'em that we not gon' be playin)
Or should I say members of the hip-hop community
(I'll blaze 'em niggaz)
Petey Pablo, a new artist signed under jive
(Aiyyo go get my homeboys)
And has teamed up with Timbaland, outta VA
(We gonna blow this up)
In a quest to redeem his title
And bring, North Carolina, and Virginia, to the front of the line
(Yeah, we gon' do it)
We're gonna stand by

This one's for North Carolina
C'mon and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina
C'mon and raise up
This one's for you, uh-huh, this one's for who?
Us, us, us
Yes sir

North Carolina
C'mon and raise up
Take your shirt off, twist it 'round your hand
Spin it like a helicopter
North Carolina
C'mon and raise up
This one's for you, uh-huh, this one's for who?
Us, us, us
Yes sir

Who am I? Petey Pab' motherfucker
First to put it down for North Carolina
But guess what
(What?)
It's been worth it
I'm a superstar, bought me a big ol' car
Four point six
(See the car)
Black with the bars from the front to back
And got a button in the middle, make the trunk go "eh-eh"
But it ain't 'bout that
It's about gettin' whatchu gettin' and drivin' all back here
Big fellas
(Six fellas)
Half of me and Carolina niggaz done time together
Polk, Bladen, Marshall, Hoke, Greene County, Tillery, damn
Transfer, Sandy Ridge, Browns over here
(Greens over here)
Pasqoutank, down on the, Odom East
(Lemme think)
