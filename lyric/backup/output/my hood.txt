Every time I do it, I do it for my hood
And every time I do it, I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it, I do it for they hood
It's understood, I do it for the hood

Every time I do it, I do it for my hood
And every time I do it, I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it, I do it for they hood
It's understood, I do it for the hood

The streets love Jeezy and I love 'em back
And if I still had the work, I frontcha sack, hey
It's all gravy, still reaching wit my words
And make 'em feel good like the first and the third

Take you back when I was sixteen, wit a bankroll
Posted on a corner like a light pole
They used to call us track stars
Before they even stopped, we ran to dem cars

And everybody on the block got the same agenda
Hustle from January 'til the end of December
Wasn't smokin' purple, then it was more like Bobby Brown
On that hen dog straight, got a nigga drinking brown
