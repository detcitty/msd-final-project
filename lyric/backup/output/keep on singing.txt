Keep on singing, don't stop singing
You're gonna be a star some day
You're gonna make a lot of people happy
When they come to hear you play

I don't remember mama
She died when I was born
We lived in a one room shanty
But daddy tried to make it a home
When I was only 6 years old
Started singin' in the streets
People would throw me pennies
So I could help daddy make ends meet

He said, "Keep on singin'
Don't stop singin'
You're gonna be a star someday
You're gonna make a lot of people happy
When they come to hear you play"

He said, "Keep on singin'
Keep the bells a ringin'
Spread the music from town to town
There's not enough love in this old world
