Strictly outta curiosity,
What would happen if you got with me?
Kissin' you would hit the spot with me
Come on skip a couple rocks with me

Gimme any of your heart tonight
Ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
I got somethin' we could start tonight
Lookin' at you girl it's hard to fight

Those stars need to be wished on
Your skin needs to be kissed on
My eyes baby they're fixed on you in your snapback
