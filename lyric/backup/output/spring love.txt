In the winter my heart grows lonely
I needed someone to love me only
I thought of you and called you on the phone
Now you're my only one, don't have to be alone

You gave me love
In January, in February
So love full bloom
In March and April
And the way to June

You're my Spring love
No one makes me feel like you do, ho
Spring love, Spring love
There'll be no one after you

'Cause every morning I hold my pillow
