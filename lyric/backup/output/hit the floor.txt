Yeah, we gon' take it from the bottom to the windy city
Miami's finest, Chi Town's finest, Pitbull, Twista
And we want all the women to
Boogie boogie boogie, go ahead baby
Boogie boogie boogie, go ahead baby
Boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie

Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'
Get down hit the flo'

Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir

Shake it, shake it fo' me
Come and work it for me, shawty but don't break it for me
Wiggle wiggle want you, come on and get naked fo me
Say you like the dick, won't you come and take it from me

Gon' twirk it fo' me while I let the dick slide
Pop it fo me mama, show me you know how to ride
Now stop runnin' from me, go and hold that fatty up
Now let me beat up until you say you've had enough

Pitbull and twista shawty, show me how you work that work that
Got to the flo' but don't hurt that, hurt that
Take you with me if you can show me how you do that
Looking so hot and got the hood hollin', who dat

Hit it so hard mamacita, come and let me inspect yo thigh
