Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I messed up tonight
I lost another fight
Lost to myself, but I'll just start again

I keep falling down
I keep on hitting the ground
But I always get up now to see what's next

Birds don't just fly
They fall down and get up
Nobody learns without getting it wrong

I won't give up
No, I won't give in till I reach the end
And then I'll start again
No, I won't leave
