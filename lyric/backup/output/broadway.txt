Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker
Than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight

See the young man sittin'
In the old man’s bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night’s gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls

Forgotten but not gone
You drink it of your mind
You talk about the world
Like it’s someplace that you’ve been

You see you’d love to run home
But you know you ain’t got one
'Cause you’re livin’ in a world
That you’re best forgotten around here
