Okay, yeah (it's poppin, it's poppin.)

All the boys keep jockin'

Love tha way I puts it on so perfect
Wipe the corners of my mouth so I work it

When I walk down the hallway they cant say nothing

Oh oh oh my lips so luscious
The way I spice it up with tha mac mac brushes
Lorial got the most watermelon crushes
That probally is the why these boys got crushes.
