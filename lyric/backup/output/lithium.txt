I'm so happy
'Cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly
That's okay 'cause so are you
Broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care
And I'm not scared, light my candles
In a daze 'cause I've found God
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so lonely
