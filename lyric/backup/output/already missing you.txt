Aw girl, what's up? Aw, not again
So you're packin' your bags
And you're leaving? But that ain't right
You need to stay awhile, think about it
But wait a minute, before you go
There's just one thing I want you to know
We both agree that this love
Ain't what it used to be, we just grew apart
I got nothin' but love for you, baby
Girl, you'll always be my heart
It's gonna to be strange living without you
Ain't felt so empty before, no
