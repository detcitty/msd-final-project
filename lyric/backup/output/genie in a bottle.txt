Come on come on
Um yeah
Oh... w-o-o... come on come on
Uh
I feel like I've been locked up tight for a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're licking your lips and blowing kisses my way but that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby baby baby
(baby baby baby)
Oh... w-h-o-a...
My body's saying let's go (go)
Oh... w-h-o-a...
But my heart is saying no (no)

If you wanna be with me baby there's a price to pay

I'm a genie in a bottle
(genie in a bottle baby) Yeah
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
