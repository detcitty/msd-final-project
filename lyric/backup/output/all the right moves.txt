All the right friends in all the right places, so yeah, we're goin' down

They got all the right moves and all the right faces, so yeah, we're goin' down
Let's paint the picture of the perfect place

They got it better than what anyone's told you

They'll be the King of Hearts, and you're the Queen of Spades
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers

I know we got it good, but they got it made

And their grass is getting greener each day

I know things are looking up, but soon they'll take us down
