I see you drive around town with the guy I love
And I'm like forget you
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like forget you and forget him too
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with you
Ha, now ain't that some shh
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a forget you
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess she's an Xbox, and I'm more an Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Well, I've got some news for you
