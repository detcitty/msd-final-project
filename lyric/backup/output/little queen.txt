You'd rather have wine than gin
And only the finest by your skin
Always running after time
Catching your fancy with rhymes
Shining on the front page again

Now you're hot on the presses today
Little queen
Making your passion play
Little queen
Nobody knows your melancholy mind
Little queen

Away from the sellers, the papers said
Your crown was tight and heavy on your head
But still you danced and you sang
