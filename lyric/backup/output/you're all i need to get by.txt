You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by

As long as I got you then baby
You know that you've got me oh
'Cause we've got our love in some
R E S P E C T oh

Like sweet morning dew, took one look at you
And it was plain to see that you were my destiny
