I was thinking about parking the other night
We was out on a back road
Me and my baby was just getting right
All our systems on overload
Radio blasting in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
We was snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time

Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the body heat
