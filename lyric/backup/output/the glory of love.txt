Mmmm... 
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

You know, in your lifetime
You're gonna have many broken hearts
And sometimes you can't always finish
You can't finish the things that you start

You know, somebody's gotta win and
And, and somebody's always gotta lose
But I want you to remember this
