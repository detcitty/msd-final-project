Havana Brown
RedOne, Mr. Worldwide
From Miami, Morocco
To Australia, to the world
Run ‘em like run ‘em, run ‘em
Dale
Run ‘em like run ‘em, run ‘em

When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy you're afraid of the dark, dark
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me do you know where to start, start
And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel apart, apart
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound, sound
