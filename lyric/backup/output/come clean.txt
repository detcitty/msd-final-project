You wanna front, what? Jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck
I snatch fake gangsta MC's and make em faggot flambe
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist steadily pumps the funk
The results your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East poppin that game
You won't survive, get live, catchin wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
I'm a true master you can check my credentials
'Cause I choose to use my infinite potentials
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky-freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro
Locked cuba So deep that you can scuba
Dive/my jive origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honies all across the map
'Cause I'd rather bust a nut then bust a cap
In Ya back in fact my rap snaps ya sacroilliac
I'm the mack so i don't need to tote a Mac
