Your love is wonderful, yeah
And I don't want to loose you
So baby

Chorus:
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby I'll do what I gotta do

Verse 1:
Sleepless nights, and lonely days
Are all that fill my head
All of the time, oh baby, but all I do
Is think about the way you make me feel
Cuz baby this love is so real
