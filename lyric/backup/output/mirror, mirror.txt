Mirror, mirror
On the wall
You said you had the answers to it all
You never told me I'd take a fall

Mirror, mirror
On the wall

You, you turned my life
Into a paperback novel
Words that come to life
Inside your little melodrama

Chapter one
When I was young
I came to you with my problems
Chapter two
You promised me love
And anything that I desired

Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
