Clap your hands, all so right
(turn me up, turn me up)
clap your hands, all so right
clap your hands, all so right

clap your hands, all so right
If tomorrow is judgment day
(Sing Mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line

And the lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
(clap your hands, all so right)
(clap your hands, all so right)

If I wake up in World War III
(world war, in world war III)
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home

It's okay if you're coming with me
(clap your hands, all so right)
(clap your hands, all so right)
(clap your hands, all so right)

'Cause your love is my love
(my love)
