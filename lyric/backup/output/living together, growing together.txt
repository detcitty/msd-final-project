Start with a man and you have one
Add on a woman and then you have two
Add on a child and what have you got?
You've got more than three
You've got what they call a family

Living together
Growing together
Just being together
That's how it starts
Three loving hearts all
Pulling together
Working together
Just building together
That makes you strong
