I told you I'd leave a light on
In case you ever wanted to come back home
You smiled and said you appreciate the gesture
I took every word to heart
'Cause I can't stand us bein' apart
Just to show how much I really miss ya

Every light in the house is on
The backyard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
