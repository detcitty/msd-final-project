You

Say a little prayer for you
Me a-go say a little prayer for you

From the moment me wake up
Before me put on me make up
Me say a little prayer for you
Me combing me hair now
Me a-wonder which dress fe wear now
Me say a little prayer for you

(Forever and ever)
You stay in my heart
And I'll love you
(Forever and ever)
We never will part
And I'll love you
(Together, together)
That's how it should be
Without you
Would only be heartbreak for me

Me run fe the bus, love
Me a-ride and me a-think 'bout us, love
Me say a little prayer for you
(Say a little prayer for you)
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time
Me say a little prayer for you
Oh

Forever and ever
