I'll pack up all my things and walk away
I don't want to hear another word you have to say
I've been waiting for so long,
(so long)
I just found out there's something wrong,
(something is wrong)
nothing will get better if I stay

There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you,
now I'm walkin' out the door
(walking out the door)
You used me, you've deceived me,
(what you trying to do to me?)
and you never seem to need me
but I'll bet, you won't forget me when I go
(Oh no, no, no)

Seems I've been lost in a dream,
pretending that you care
