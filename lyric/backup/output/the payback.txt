Hey! Gotta, gotta payback!
(The big payback)
Revenge! I'm mad!
(The big payback)
Got to get back!

I need some get-back!
Payback!
Payback!(The big payback)
That's it! Payback!

Revenge!
I'm mad!

You get down with my girlfriend, that ain't right.
Wow! Smokin'!
Hollerin' n' cussin', you wanna fight

Payback is a thing you gotta see
Hell! Brother do any damn thing to me
You sold me out for chicken change
(Yes you did)

You told me that they, they had it all arranged
You had me down, and that's a fact
And now you punk, you gotta get ready

For the big payback
(The big payback)
That's where I land, on the big payback
