I know you've heard that worn out line
About love at first sight
Well I never knew those words were true
Till you walked in tonight
All it took was just one look
To knock me off my feet
I'm not a man of many words
So I'll make this short and sweet

Could ya would ya ain't ya gonna if I asked you
Would ya wanna be my baby tonight
