Every time that something good happens in my life
You're always there for me, looking good by my side
Picture you now, pullin' up your pantyhose
And you always got that sexy underwear on

So much good has come my way since she came in my life
I'll never push you away or brush you off to the side
See girl I see my luck has changed for the better

See I got so much love for you in these arms
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm?
Where you are, forever, girl, ain't no harm
Ain't nobody else can run with, I won't allow it

So much love for you in these arms
Don't you know that you're my good luck charm?
Lovin' you forever girl
And never do I wanna go without my good luck charm
