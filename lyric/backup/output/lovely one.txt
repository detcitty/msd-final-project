Why don't you believe me when I say that I love you?
I'm crazy 'bout you
Wear the face that tells me you think my loving ain't true
I'm all about you
You're my desire
I get higher everytime I speak your name
All I do (that's all I do, that's all I do, that's all I do)
The way that I can't sleep at night just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you

Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty
Gone with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love you
When it's giving my love pains
