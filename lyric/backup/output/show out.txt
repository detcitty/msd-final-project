Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out
Everytime I go out, you know I bring the dough out
Everytime they go out, you know they bring they ho out
Everytime I go out, you know I bring that flow out
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out
Everytime I go out, you know I gotta show out
Trippy niggaz and a few hoes
One night, two shows
That's two mansions and a team expansion
Thumbin' through a check, got me sweatin and pantin'
When you getting money chicks start coming around
Niggaz start hatin' who's holdin' you down
All this ice I'm just livin the life
Bad bitches want me, give me head like lice
Hit club LIV in a rush
Pockets so swole I think they finna bust
Ace in my hand and a 45 tuck
Money coming down codeine pourin up
Smokin on some dope, always on a float
20 years in niggaz callin me the G.O.A.T
