The fortune queen of New Orleans,
Was brushing her cat in her black limousine
On the backseat were scratches from
The marks of men her fortune she had won
Couldn't see through the tinted glass,
She said "Home James" and he hit the gas
I Followed her to some darkened room,
She took my money, she said "I'll be with you soon"

Dark Lady laughed and danced and lit the candles one by one
