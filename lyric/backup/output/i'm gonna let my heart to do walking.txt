Goodbye my love
Happy life my love
I'm tired and I just can't take no more
Tired of being tough
'Cause enough is enough
This time I'm really headed for the door
You better believe

I'm gonna let my heart do the walking
(Whoo-oo, oo-oo)
Walk me in to something good
(So good, so good)
I'm gonna let my heart do the walking
(Do the walking)
Oh, it ain't no make believin'
My heart's set on leaving
