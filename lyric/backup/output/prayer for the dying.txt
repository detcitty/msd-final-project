Da da, da da

Ah, ho-oo-oh-oo

Fearless people,
Careless needle.
Harsh words spoken,
And lives are broken.

Forceful ageing,
Help me I'm fading.
Heaven's waiting,
It's time to move on.

Crossing that bridge,
With lessons I've learned.
Playing with fire,
And not getting burned.
I may not know what you're going through.
But time is the space,
Between me and you.
Life carries on... it goes on.
