Baby, you know sometimes
You make me want to scream, woo, uh
Suga, suga, suga, yeah, yeah

All was not lost today
Your brown eyes converted me
And let me know
That you're the right girl for me
You don't need to, you don't, need too
Of the same love I offer you

It would be ashamed
To let someone else take my place
