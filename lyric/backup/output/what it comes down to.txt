Here I am lovin' you
You? re like a dream come true
For so long I? ve waited for this time
Girl what you mean to me

In reality, you what I ever hoped for
You will always be
More than right for me
Each day I love you more

Well, what it comes down to
This is all I want from you
Yeah, same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding

For what we have at stake, a little give and take
It? s better than demanding
