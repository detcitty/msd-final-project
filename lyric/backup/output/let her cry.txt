She sits alone by a lampost
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
She says "Dad's the one I love the most
But Stipe's not far behind"

She never lets me in
Only tells me where she's been
When she's had too much to drink
I said that I don't care
I just run my hands through her dark hair
Then I pray to God, you gotta help me fly away
And just

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
