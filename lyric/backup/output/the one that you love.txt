Now the night has gone
Now the night has gone away...
Doesn't seem that long
We hardly had two words to say...
Hold me in your arms
For just another day
I promise this one will go slow
Oh...

We have the right to know
We have the right to know
Don't say the mornings come
Don't say the mornings come so soon...
Must we end this way
When so much here is hard to lose...
Love is everywhere
I know it is

Such moments as this
Are too few
Oh...
