She's hot, she's freak-a-ristic

Last night when I walked into the joint
Everyone felt the sweat, oh, so wet
Walked into the crowd, lunged in with the freaks
Everyone doing the dance, I even saw the freak of the week

She was wearing those red shoes, everybody replied, “She's hot”
And as she riddled to the rhythm of a beat, everybody fell apart, woah
All of a sudden, she turned her head, eyes full of flame
I was hypnotized, mesmerized, I didn't even know my name

Well, well, well, and she was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's freak-a-ristic, hot

She took me by the hand, led me to the back
