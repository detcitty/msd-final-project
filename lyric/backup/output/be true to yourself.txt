Let's take a trip on
The other side of the land
With things ain't planned
For the average man

You could be a young brother
Who's rolling
And be so good
That you hold him

Big brain, top brain
Mister Two-co who got
All the hoes

Pushing hard
To keep from being bound
'Cause there's always somebody
Trying to bring you down

Try to run a scheme
On what you got
'Cause what you got
Them niggas jot

Women love it
And brothers hate it
They just can't stand
To see you make it

A girl can be
Your main downfall
She don't take half
The hoe takes all

Now check to see
