You think that I don't feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In other's eyes I see reflected, a hurt, scorn, rejected.

Chorus 1:
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

Started my life, in an old, cold, run down tenement slum
My father left, he never even married mom
Or shared the gift my momma knew
