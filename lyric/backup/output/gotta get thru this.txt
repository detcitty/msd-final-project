If only I could get through this
I just gotta get through this...

I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make, gotta make it, gotta make it through
Said I'm gonna get through this
I'm gonna get through this
I gotta take, gotta take my mind off of you

Give me just a second and I'll be all right
Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
Give me till tomorrow then I'll be okay
Just another day and then I'll hold you tight
