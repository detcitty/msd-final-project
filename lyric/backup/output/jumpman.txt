Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country
Them boys up to something, they just not just bluffing
You don't have to call, I hit my dance like Usher, woo
I just found my tempo like I'm DJ Mustard, woo
I hit that Ginobili with my left hand up like woo
Lobster and CÃ©line for all my babies that I miss
Chicken fingers, French fries for them hoes that wanna diss
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something
Uh, uh, uh, I think I need some Robitussin
