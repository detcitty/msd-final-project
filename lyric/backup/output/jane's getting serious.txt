I like get up
With my partner in crime
We love to dress up
And have ourselves a good time
We have an understanding
She can never be mine

We get on so well
There's no pressure on us
It's a relationship
Based entirely on trust
No complications
You will never see me focus

Come around eleven
And it's time to go home
I'm going her way
But I can't leave her alone
But she's looking at me
As If I'm something she owns, oh

Jane's getting serious
