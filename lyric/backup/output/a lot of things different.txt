I'd of spent a lot more time in the pouring rain
without an umbrella coverin my head
And I'd have stood up to that bully when he pushed
and called me names, but I was too afraid
And I'd have gone and saw Elvis that night he came to town
But momma said I couldn't
And I'd have went skinny dippin with Jenny Carson
that time she dared me to, but I didn't

O I, I'd done a lot of things different
