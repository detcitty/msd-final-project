You boys ever met a real cuntry girl?
I'm talkin' true blue, out in the woods
Down home cuntry

She's a hot little number in her pick-up truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all-nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamma-jamma from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' Cajun, lunatic from Brunswick
Juicy Georgia peach
With a thick southern drawl, sexy swingin' walk

Brother she's all cuntry, shoot
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's cuntry
