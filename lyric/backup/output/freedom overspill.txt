Keep on talking all you want
Well you don't waste a minute of time
Who cares, who knows what's true
Coffee and tears the whole night through
Burning up on midnight oil
And it's come right back on you

Freedom Overspill
Freedom Overspill

Force of habit, you could say
The way they talk you're talking away
Who cares, who knows what's true
Your wounded pride is burning you up
