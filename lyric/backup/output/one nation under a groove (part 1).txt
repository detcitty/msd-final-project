So, wide can't get around it
So, low you can't get under it
(So, low you can't get under it)
So, high you can't get over it
(So, high you can't get over it)
Da-yee do do do do do do
This is a chance, this is a chance
Dance your way out of your constrictions
(Tell sugah)
Here's a chance to dance our way out of our constrictions
Gonna be freakin', up and down
Hang up alley way with the groove our
Only guide we shall all be moved
