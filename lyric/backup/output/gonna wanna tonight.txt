If you wanna climb a letter on a water tower
than we'll kick it with the stars for a couple of hours
If you wanna we're gonna get way up high
If you wanna dip your toes where waters stops
If you wanna then we're gonna have to give a try, that's right

If you gonna go out wait
where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to falling down
And let your red lips leave
Their mark all over mine

If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night
