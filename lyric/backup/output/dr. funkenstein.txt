Woah, they say the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill, baby.
Call me the big pill, Dr. Funkenstein.
The disco fiend with the monster sound.
The grove ghoul with the bump transplant.

Hip bone connected to my thigh bone.
My thigh bone connected to my leg bone.
My leg bone connected to my ankle bone.
I get so hung up on bones.
Dr. Funkenstein here.
Preoccupied and dedicated to the preservation of the motion of hips.

We love to funk you, Funkenstein, your funk is the best.
(Talk!)
Take my body, give it the mind, to funk with the rest.
(Kiss me on my ego)
Hit me with the one and then, if you like, hit me again.
We love to Funkastein.
(O-o-o-over)

Dr. Funkenstein, king of the funk, yeah.
Swift lippin', ego trippin' and body snatchin'.
I'll blow your mind.
Comin' to you directly from the mother ship.
Pulling up the last leg of the P funk.
Yeah!
