(Verse 1: 2Pac)
See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavily
I got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasin' me around
And it's always drama
Whevever I wanna get around
Mama told me
Long before I ever came up
Gotta be true, to watchya' do
And keep ya' game up
'Cause things change
And jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wifes house tryin' to mack her!
I'm on tour
But still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry
I'm steady wantin' more
Every day is a test, yes
I try hard
But I'm strugg-a-lin' with every breath
I pray to God that the woman that I left at home
All alone
Ain't nothin' like tryin' to bone
Over the phone
In my mind
I can see her naked
I can't take it
Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew.

(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
I'm rollin' out on tour today you gettin' sad cause I'm goin' away, Naa
Chickenheads wanna play with me you gettin' mad cause you think I'm a sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream soon as I hit the stage, Naa
Still I be gettin' lonely for you I'm comin' home as soon as I make this pay. (echoes)
