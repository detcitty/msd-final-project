Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight baby?(Hmmmm)
Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight baby? (Ohhhh)

Before I let you go, before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight baby? (oohh yeah...)
Before I let you go before I let you go
Can I get a kiss goodnight baby?

Lately I been thinkin'
Somethings going on
'Cause you got an attitude
You're not in the mood
Like you use to...

Girl I can feel it
When I hold you in my arms
The feeling is not the same
And I'd be the one to blame
I don't want to lose your love (hmmm)
I don't wanna say bye-bye (oh nooo)
True love is so hard to find
And it's right between your lips and mine... and mine
Before I let go...
