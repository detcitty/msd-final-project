WESTBOUND #9
The Flaming Ember

Catching the westbound number nine
Gonna leave this town, leave it far behind
Gonna leave while I've got my peace of mind
On the westbound number nine

Sittin' on the bank of Holy Creek down by the county line
I can hear the sound of Old Boss and Lazy Horse--he's howlin' right on time
He's howlin' at the sound of the #9 comin' down the line
