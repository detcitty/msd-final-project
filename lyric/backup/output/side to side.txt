I've been here all night, Ariana
I've been here all day, Nicki Minaj
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
Let them hoes know

I'm talkin' to ya
See you standing over there with your body
Feeling like I wanna rock with your body
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('bout nothin')
I'm comin' at ya
Cause I know you got a bad reputation
Doesn't matter, cause you give me temptation
And we don't gotta think 'bout nothin' ('bout nothin')

These friends keep talkin' way too much
Saying I should give you up
Can't hear them no, cause I...

I've been here all night
I've been here all day
And boy, got me walkin' side to side
I've been here all night
