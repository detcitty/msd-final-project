We come into this world unknown
But know that we are not alone
They try and knock us down
But change is coming, it's our time now

Hey... everybody loses it
Everybody wants to throw it all away sometimes
And hey... yeah I know what you're going through

Don't let it get the best of you, you'll make it out alive
Ohh
People like us we've gotta stick together
Keep your head up, nothing lasts forever
Here's to the damned, to the lost and forgotten

It's hard to get high when you're living on the bottom
Oh woah oh oh woah oh
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh woah oh oh woah oh
