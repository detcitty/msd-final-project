Yeah!

I loved her fancy underwear
I'd sit behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get
To tell her I'm the one she should be with, oh
She's popular with all the guys
So innocent in my eye
I could see her in my life
She would've had the world if she were mine
But, see she had other plans, I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends, varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out
