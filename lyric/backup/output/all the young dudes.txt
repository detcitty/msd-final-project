Well, Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was twenty-five
Speed jive, don't want to stay alive
When you're twenty-five

And Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks and Sparks
And Freddy's got spots from ripping off the stars
From his face
Funky little boat race

Television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile deliquent wrecks
Oh, man, I need TV when I got T-Rex
Oh, brother, you've guessed, I'm a dude, dad

All the young dudes (Hey, dudes!)
Carry the news (Where are you?)
Boogaloo dudes (Stand up, come on!)
Carry the news
