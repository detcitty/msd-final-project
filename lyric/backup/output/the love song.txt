First time i felt it,
I think I was five years old,
I was scared, had a nightmare
Mama was there for me to hold.

Daddy he was different,
He never said it much,
But I heard him loud and clear
When he brought home that ball and glove.

And it took on a brand new meaning,
I wasn't just a boy no more
When she moved in next door...

Where you from?
