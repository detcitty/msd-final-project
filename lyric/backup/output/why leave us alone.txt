Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Understanding and trusting
Is what our love is built on
So won't you at least try to
Respect what we're about, hey

Why leave us alone
Why break up our home
Why leave us alone
Why break up our happy home [No, no, no]

Ooh... these changes that you're bringing (Bringing)
I can't adjust to
So quickly
