Yo, e to the x to the c-l-u
From the s to the I, baby, v-i-t-y
Exclusivity

To the e to the x to the c-l-u
From the s to the I, baby, v-i-t-y
Exclusivity

Now, dig

Baby, see you mean the world to me
And I refuse to be without your love
Love for me just like I love for you
And maybe we will be forever one

When I fall in love
Girl, I fall in love
You will be the only one
If you believe in love
Like I believe in love, baby
Girl, I want you, I want you

And when I feel the need
Girl, I feel the need
You will be the only one for me
I will be relieved that
You will be with me, baby

(CHORUS)
All I want from you
Is what you want from me
Ecxlusivity
And what you want from me
Is what I want from you
Baby, exclusivity

Baby, please
You are my everything
And how I long to be
Inside your world
