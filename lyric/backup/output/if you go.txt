Taking a day at a time
Dealing with feelings I don't wanna hide
Learning to love as I go baby
Without taking you along for a ride

Tried to find myself, tried to find the truth
Get out from this shell, girl I'm almost there
To show you how much I really care

If you go, say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
