The animals are winding me up
The jungle call, the jungle call
In Xanadu did Kublai Khan pleasuredome erect
Moving on keep moving on-yeah
Moving at one million miles an hour
Using my power, I sell it by the hour
I have it so I market it, you really can't afford it-yeah
Really can't afford it

Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
There goes a supernova what a pushover-yeah
There goes a supernova what a pushover
We're a long way from home

Welcome to the pleasuredome
