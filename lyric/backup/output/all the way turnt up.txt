(A.E. on the tracks)
Jammin' my music live
(Soulja Boy Tell 'Em)
His own fault it's a gas

DJ turn me up, do not turn me down
Just gon' turn me up
Roscoe, that's what's up

And shawty we

DJ turn me up, crank me to the max
I got lots of wallet, I be blowin' stacks
Polo on my ***, shoes turnt to the max
I be so turnt up, I be swaggin' to the max

If you get it in, and you gettin' dough
Gon' pop a bottle, this right here yo' song
Purple bottoms on, you can smell it on my clothes
And a man up in my switcher, 'bout to take one to the dogs
