Wish that you could build a time machine
So you could see
The things no one can see
Feels like you're standing on the edge
Looking at the stars
And wishing you were them

What do you do when a chapter ends?
Do you close the book and never read it again?
Where do you go when your story's done?
You can be who you were or who you'll become

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
If it all goes wrong
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Darling, just hold on
