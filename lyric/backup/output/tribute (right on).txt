Tribute

This rhythm is a mama

Hey I want to tell you a story
It's about the groove
All Right now look hope here
Hope it makes you move
And get's the rhythm too
Yeah oh yeah

Well there's music from the past
Music for the young and old
Music revelation rock and roll and soul

Ref:
Right on right on
Right on (repeat)
