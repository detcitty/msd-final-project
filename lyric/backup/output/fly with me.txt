If time was still
The sun would never, never find us
We could light up
The sky tonight
If I could see the world through your eyes
Leave it all behind

If it's you and me forever
If it's you and me right now
I'd be alright
Be alright
If we chase the stars to lose our shadow
Peter Pan and Wendy turned out fine
