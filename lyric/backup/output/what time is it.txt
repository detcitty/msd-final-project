What time is it?
Shimmertime
It's our vacation
What time is it?
Party time
That's right, say it loud

What time is it?
The time of our lives
Anticipation
What time is it?
Summertime
School's out, scream and shout!

Finally summer's here
Good to be chiilin' out
I'm off the clock
The pressures out
Now my girl's what it's all about

Ready for some sunshine
For my heart to take a chance
I'm here to stay
Not movin' away
Ready for a summer romance

Everybody ready, going crazy, yeah we're out
Come on and let me hear you say it now, right now

What time is it?
Summertime
It's our vacation
What time is it?
