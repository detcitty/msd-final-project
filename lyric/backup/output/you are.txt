Baby you'll find
There's only one love
Yours and mine
I've got so much love

And needing you so
My love for you
I'll never let go
I've got so much love

All I want is to hold you
Let me show how much I love you baby (Show you)
I don't mind and I don't mind (Loving you)
Girl I love you
There's no one above you
