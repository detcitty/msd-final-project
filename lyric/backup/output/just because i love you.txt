I got no hidden agenda here inside
Couldn't stop these emotions if I tried
You're all I wanna do
I got something here waiting just for you

Deep in my heart, that's where you shine
Give you my best, all of the time
For no other reason, no other rhyme, baby

Just because I love you
Just because I love you like the moon and stars it's a natural fact
Just because I love you
Just because I love you, don't need to second guess, it's as simple as that
