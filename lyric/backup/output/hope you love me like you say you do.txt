What does a girl like you, see in a man like me ?
Just cause I love you baby, don't think I'll be,
just what you want me to be.
Ooh, yes I'm stubborn, I'm hard headed, but baby I love you.

And I hope you love me like you say I do.
And I hope you love me like you say I do.

You know in today's world, a woman feels, she must be free.
ooh, that's OK, it's only right, but will you still, love me ?
