Ha, get job?
What for?
I'm trying to think

I was good, I could talk
A mile a minute
On this caffeine buzz I was on
We were really hummin'
We would talk every day for hours
We belong to the deadbeat club

Anyway we can
We're gonna find something
We'll dance in the garden
In torn sheets in the rain
We'll dance in the garden
In torn sheets in the rain
In the rain

We're the deadbeat club
We're the deadbeat club
