Go far enough and you will reach,
A place where the sea runs underneath.
We'll see our shadow, high in the sky,
Dying away in the night.

I've sailed the world for seven years,
And left all I love behind in tears.
Oh, won't you come here, wherever you are,
I've been all alone long enough.

You, you have your own special way,
