If you need a strong hand
To guide you through the night
If you want someone who understands
Then things can't get uptight

If it means anything to you
To know that I care for you
Check it out (Check it out)
Oh, check it out (Check it out)

I understand complications
Can sometimes bring you down
A different situation
Doesn't always be around
