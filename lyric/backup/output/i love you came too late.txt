Baby listen to me
If I have the chance
I'd say those words
Come on... oooh...

The bluest of blue
That's what her eyes are
That's what I am today

And if I had it all to do
All over again
I wouldn't have waited so long
To say...

I can't live with out you
I don't want know body else
Baby, listen very closely
I love you...
