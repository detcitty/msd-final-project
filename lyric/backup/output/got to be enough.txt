The things I do for you
I do for no one else
The things I give to you
Usually keep them for myself
Every chance I take with you
â€~Cause my luck is on the one
Your tricks, your treat, they can't be beat
They keep me on the run
I've got to be enough, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
I wanna be your stuff, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
I've got to be enough, girl
(Think about it, don't you doubt it)
