There must be something
That I'm missing
Or is it something
That she's got, oh, baby

Ladies and gentlemen
While landing at Chicago's O'Hare airport
Please fasten your seatbelts
And observe the no smoking signal
Until you're well inside the terminal
Thank you

Hello, hon, yes, this is Tyrone
Now please, don't hang up the phone

You see, I came all the way up here
Just to say to you, baby
I'm so sorry

And if my loving
Mean anything at all to you
I just wanna tell you, I've changed
I mean, I'm a brand new me
Oh, baby, yeah, I'm ready to crawl

You see
I don't know what it is you got
But whatever it is, without it
I'm a lonely man

You see, baby
Ever since I've been away
I've had a lot of time to think
A lot of time to reminisce
About all the good things about you
