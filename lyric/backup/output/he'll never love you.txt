Got someone else to keep you warm.
Youve been seen in cozy places,
But theres a calm before the storm.
Like hes been seen with other faces.

Folks say he changes with the night,
To break her heart is second nature.
Oh girl hell never do you right.
Im warning you your hearts in danger,
But you can put your love on me,
