Give it your all girl, give it all ya got,
You can take a chance, and take your best shot,
I see what you want girl, and whatcha do,
He's never gonna, gonna make it with you.

You're pullin' petals of a flower tryin' to get your way, (way)
Keep pullin' til it says what you want it to say, (say)
Girl you can pick a field full of daisies,
But he'd still be my baby,

And I know you can hardly wait 'til I'm away from him,
Instinctively, I know what your thinkin',
You'll be givin' him an open invitation,
But my baby won't be taken in...

(nooo.)

You can pout your cherry lips,
Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss, (sweet kiss)
You can flurt your pretty eyes,
