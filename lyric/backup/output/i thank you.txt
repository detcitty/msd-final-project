You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did.
And I thank you.

You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did.
And I thank you.

If you took your love to somewhere else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death
You made me feel like Ive never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

You didn't have to squeeze me but you did
But you did but you did
