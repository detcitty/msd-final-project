Now you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
'Til you come home babe, 'til you come home
Now you taste best
the poison I've learned to love has gone

I'm all alone baby, I'm all alone,
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, ooh babe

Give a little more, ooh babe
