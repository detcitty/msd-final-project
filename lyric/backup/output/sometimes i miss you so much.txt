I can tell you how I feel about you night and day

Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you
Sometimes I miss you

I can tell you how I feel about you night and day

There are only whispers and shadows for me
The way things are with the way things are
And with this, I blow a kiss to disaster
Because I wish to perfect my heart

I gotta check my mind, am I in tune with you?
Do we connect within the realm of the gods?
Electric word "life" that means forever
And that's a mighty long time when you've kissed divine

So divine, as with you
The Christ within will come in the clouds
Trusting "divinity is always with you"
Trusting "this is the here and now"
