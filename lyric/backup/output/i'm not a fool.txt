I'm reminiscing on all the times we shared
I can't seem to forget the times that we spent, and I miss
Your pretty smile just seemed to brighten up my day
I want you here with me, I'm callin' out your name
Hear me, my pretty girl
You're on my mind
I wannna hold in my my my arms
Tonight, let's make it right
Unless we're face to face you can't relate to what I have to say

Chorus
