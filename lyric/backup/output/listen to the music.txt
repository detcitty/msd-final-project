Don't you feel it growin' day by day people gettin' ready for the news
Some are happy some are sad oh we got to let the music play
Umm-hmm

What the people need is a way to make 'em smile
It ain't so hard to do if you know how
Gotta get a message get it on through oh now mama don't you ask me why
Whoa oh whoa listen to the music

Whoa oh whoa listen to the music
Whoa oh whoa listen to the music
All the time...
Well I know you know better everything I say meet me in the country for a day
We'll be happy and we'll dance oh... we're gonna dance our blues away
And if I'm feelin' good to you and you're feelin' good to me there ain't nothin' we can't do or say

Feelin' good feeling fine oh... baby let the music play
