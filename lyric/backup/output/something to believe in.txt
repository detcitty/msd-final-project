Well I see him on the TV
Preaching about the promised lands
he tells me believe in Jesus
steals the money from my hands
some say he was a good man
Lord I think he sinned... yeah

Twenty two years of mental tears
cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war
on a foreign shore
to find his country didn't want him back
their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
our lawyers took his wife and kids no regrets
In a time I don't remember
in a war he can't forget
he cried "forgive me for what I done there
Cause I never meant the things I did"

and give me something to believe in
if there's a lord above
