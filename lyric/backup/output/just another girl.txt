You think you're slick in every way
Changing up on your calls on your phone everyday
Is there something that you're trying to hide from me?
I never gave you reason to run and take your calls in the other room
Am I the only one or is somebody else kissing at you?

Is this my imagination?
Things ain't always what they seem
'Cause I don't want to be

Just another name in your little black book
Just another face in the crowd and it's got me shook
I've got to mean a little more to you
Than a space in your list of things to do

Another G-shock gun in your Benz
Another dumb bitch that you can show all your friends
You can call me crazy, say I'm insecure
But I don't wanna be just another girl

Ooh ohh ohh mmm hmm, strange how you claim to tell all the truth
