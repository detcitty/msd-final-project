Hey, yo, Funke wake up, huh? Turn your radio up, what?
It's us, it's us? Yeah, listen to the cut, it's our style, our style?
Your style, stop brother, aiyyo, nigga, wake up
Let me show you some thin'

Listen to the way they flip the metaphors and phrases
Listen, listen, it's driving me crazy
'Cause every time I do a style and flip it kind of simple
Brothers say, that's fat and do it on the demo

From a demo to a promo, now a hit on the radio
Next thing you know, they'll be doing our video
Same one? Same one, concepts, whole nine
And crazy similarities to the whole rhyme

I'm not worried though, why? I'm flipping hits from the grill
And in the underground only real stays real, so, umm
Check the skills, the skills are kinda ill and, yo
Here come the Lords, 'cause we're here to make a kill

Here come the Lords
Here come the Lords
Here come the Lords
Here come the Lords

Here come the Lords
Here come the Lords
Here come the Lords
