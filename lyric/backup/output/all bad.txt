It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like putting fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worrying about
Ooh you know females
And how they like to run they mouths
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
(like you) you (like you)
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood

They try to get at me
(they try to get at me)
Behind your back
