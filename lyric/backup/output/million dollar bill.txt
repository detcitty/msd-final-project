Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh
Came in the door, checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for is staring in my face, oh

They played our song, we hit the floor
He held me strong, and we danced the night away, oh

I can see the way that he's making me feel
This way about his love
I've been looking for something like this
I'm singing oh
If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh, oh, say oh, oh

Makes you go left, right, up, down
