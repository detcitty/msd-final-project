Better ride
You in tune to the sounds
Of the dance floor giants, 69
And we come to make you dance
And I brought my dogs wit me
Check it out

Hold up, wait a minute
Y'all dance, who think I'm pretty?
Loud man breakin' your town
We're the force to make ya get down
Know and a bigger mess in your plans
It beats nothing so I dance
69 mic on the ground, breakin' it down
Wantin' more time
But this time, it's for my dogs
South, North, all y'all
There's more little things in life to get (hot)
What about the one's in your (what)
Those that don't like huh?
Cuz me and my dogs are rightin' to get cool in it
Then I cut and chit chat, y'all where ya at? Where ya at?

1- Woof woof
Where ya at? Where ya at?
Woof woof
Where ya at? Where ya at?
Woof woof
Where ya at? Where ya at? Where ya at?

Repeat 1
Repeat 1
Repeat 1

This for the dogs in the lounge
And all the dogs in the grill
Can't be forgettin' the dogs in our town
That be keepin' it real
