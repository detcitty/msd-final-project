I don't know what they're talking about
I'm making my own decisions
This thing that I found ain't gonna bring me down
I'm like a junkie without an addiction

Mama don't cry I just wanna stay high
Like playing with danger or fear
Everybody's walking but nobody's talking
It looks a lot better from here

All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing
All I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up, I'm gonna go till I drop
You're either in or in the way
