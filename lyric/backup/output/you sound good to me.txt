The full moon
is shining like a spotlight
yeah I could just sit and listen to you talkin' all night
when you whisper
yeah baby when you lean in
yeah I get a crazy, crazy good kind of feelin'

It's like Amen from the back of the choir
Sweet hum of freedom underneath the tires
kick back sittin' by a cracklin' fire
strumming them guitar strings
and like an old song on the radio
that you grew up to and everybody knows
Rushin' of the water when the river rolls
windin' wild and free

baby you sound good to me
baby you sound so good to me
