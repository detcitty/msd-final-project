I am so in love with you
I just can't deny it
Everybody knows I can't deny it
Everybody knows
You can read me like a book
Just like a fortune teller
Everybody needs a fortune tller
Telling you the very truth

You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me love that's taking me higher
Just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

You bring out the best in me
