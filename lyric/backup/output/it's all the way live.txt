Chorus:
It's all the way live. It's all the way live.
It's all the way live. It's all the way live.

Why you take a chunk and go up for a dunk?
An' I never been a punk but your girl calls me hunk
Straight to the hoop an' I know how to shoot
If you wanna know the truth then you better get the scoop
Commin' up to miss wit' my mic in my fist
An' everybod's lookin' so you know I gotta bit
You take me, that can't be
Shook an' took like all rookies
So if you're a beginner an' you want wanna be a winner
Then you better have some spinach with your dinner
So just put your head to the sky, if you wanna ride
and keep you eye on the flies 'cause it's live
