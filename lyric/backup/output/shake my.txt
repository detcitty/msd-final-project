I've come to shake my ass
I've come to shake my ass
(Three 6 Mafia)
I've come to shake my ass
I've come to hypnotize my ass

I've come to shake my ass
Need anythin', I'm gonna give it real
Just wanna shake my ass
Mean when I drink cuz I'm onto you
So can I shake my ass?
Meanwhile I shakin' make 'em sing, sing
With the bang, with the bomb, with the bomb

Yeah, a bomb in the club
Fresh off of the crash
Freshen up tail like an old mouse trap
Tell me what it is, how the 88 sound
I'm gonna take you to my crib for a lil' night cap

But then the slap, ghetto clown
Tap, tap, tap to the pretty little gal
Pump and burn to Knicca
Pump and burn to Knicca

Take a little break to hit me, hit me back
Go unless you make it now
Body moving like, there she go
Make me snap, already get me hard
Like high school jock straps

Let's recap
