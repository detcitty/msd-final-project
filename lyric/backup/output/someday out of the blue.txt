Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I 'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the Foreign field
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I turn and I see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon
