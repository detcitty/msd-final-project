Take the world
Shakin', stirrin'
That's what I've goin' on
I throw my cares up in the air
And I don't think they're comin' down
Yeah, I love how it feels right now

This Is The Life!
Hold on tight!
And this is the dream!
It's all I need!

You never know where you'll find it
And I'm gonna take my time, yeah
