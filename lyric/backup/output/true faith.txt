I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A sudden sense of liberty

I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow

Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
