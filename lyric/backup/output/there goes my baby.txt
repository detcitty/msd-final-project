All alone I sit
looking out of the window
and the rain just keeps coming on down

Well, I cry to myself
so many things that I have done wrong
now I'm watching you
walk out

There goes my baby
moving on down the line
wonder where
wonder where
wonder where he is bound

I broke his heart
and I made him cry
now I'm alone
so all alone
what can I do
