Livin' with my eyes closed
Goin' day to day
I never knew the difference
I never cared either way
Lookin' for a reason
Searchin' for a sign
Reachin' out with both hands
I gotta feel the kick inside

All fired up (now I believe there comes a time)
All fired up (when everything just falls in line)
All fired up (we live an' learn from our mistakes)
All fired up, fired up, fired up
Hey!

Ain't nobody livin'
