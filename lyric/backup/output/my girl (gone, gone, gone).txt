Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long
Gone gone gone, she been gone so long
She been gone gone gone so long

Ever since she left me
I sure feel all alone
A little misunderstanding
I can't get her on the telephone

Hanging out down on Main Street
Living in a different world
Standing around
With the gang on the corner
Talking about my girl
