(Talking) Back again... It's the jankiest the jankiest
Still gettin' my stalk on walk on
Verse 1
One of the G'est WSC riders
One about the Feds on camera with the folded bandanna
It's me the G you be a seein' Nighttrain sipper
two fingers split I'ma get her once again I bring her
Skip skip throw it up throw it up give it up or get rolled up
swole up thought I told ya 'bout this Maad Circle Soldier
Allstars locs pieces khakis and linens
the OG Godfather with the blue feather in it
The shadiest nigga what's crackin' who got the sack and
nigga what they goin' for everybody's on the floor
Make way for the loccest cutthroat with a beard long as Moses
walkin' through yo camps and striking penitentiary poses
A straight vet Connect Gang is my set
