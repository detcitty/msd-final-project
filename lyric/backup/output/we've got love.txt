I could be tryin'
Look the rest of my life
To find that special love
Yeah

And the moment I saw you
I immediately thought
I took one look into your eyes
And I knew it

We've got love
We've got the world
We've got the joy
We've got the happiness

That number one feelin'
That beautiful togetherness
You are truly Heaven sent
With that magical ingredient

Oh, we've got love
Let's express that love somehow
Let's express it
Right here and now

With a beautiful
Beautiful vow
