Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Yeah yeah
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Listen babe

Every time I see you, I get a bad vibe
Just thinkin' of someone else in between your thighs
And you thought you were slick, had tricks up your sleeve
But I see your stupid ass and I know you're tired of me
That's why I say

When we were together
We never turned our backs on each other
But now that we're separated
We can't stand one another

I don't wanna be with you, put that on everything I own
I can't believe I stayed around that damn long
If I never see you again, I won't be mad at all, no no
