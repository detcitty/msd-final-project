Workin', workin' up a black sweat {x4}

I don't wanna take my clothes off, but I do
I don't wanna turn nobody on 'less it's U, oh
I don't wanna dance 2 hard, baby
But this is a groove (Yes it is, funky)
I'm hot, and I don't care who knows it
I got a job 2 do, yes (Think I don't, come on, come on, uh)

I'm workin', workin' up a black sweat
I'm workin', workin' up a black sweat
