Now you done been around the world and you've seen a lot of girls
But, you ain't neva seen a girl look so fly like
You done rolled through some hoods, there's some girls that look good
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like

And you did partied, did some hugs
And some girls show you love
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, but chu never had a girl look so fly like me

Now, I'd done been around the world, thought I'd seen it all
Her color, her shape, what I need and all
Twitch like seasons, when the summers, spring and fall
In back seat of my jeep, I'm chrome veet and all

On the hunt for these girls was like my day to day
Get 'em alone, I jump 'em and den fade away
I give it good, so some of them won't stay away
They try to lock me up, but I break away

And to the day I lay my eyes on the princess
And you can tell she was a dime from a distance
It took a minute to come to my senses
She's the perfect match as God is my witness

Now, for the first time I've opened my eyes
Put my glass in the air, now I toasting the sky
Feels like I'm in heaven, and I'm hoping to fly
