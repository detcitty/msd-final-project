Lying by your side I watch you sleepin'
And in your face the sweetness of a child
Murmuring the dream you won't recapture
Though it will haunt the corners of your mind

Oh, I've lost you
Though you're near me
And your body's still as kind
I've lost you on the journey
But I can't remember where or when
