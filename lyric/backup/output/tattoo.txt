No matter what you say about love

I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire, sooner or later
I get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life

I learn every time I bleed
The truth is a stranger, soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free to admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry but I have to move on and leave you behind

I can't waste time so give it a moment, I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry about everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back, got a new direction

I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
