Thug holiday, go ahead you can cry it's alright baby
Everything gone be gravy later, that's right
Ah, this is the time when we take time to remember
All the loved ones we lost in the struggle you know
I dedicate this to my brother Hollywood, Lil' Toby, Bam
My dog Itchy and Lil Trav, I dedicate this to the struggle
Everybody in the county jail, state penn, and fed, check it out

If weren't for bad luck, hell, I guess that it's possible have none
But when I think about it, where would I be without my gun
How could I, get away from the po-pos if, a nigga could run
And why was I, given a daughter when I always prayed for a son
Life is crazy ain't it, sometimes I even think da same thang
I been waitin' on freedom to ring, hell, but ain't a thang changed

And I lost my brotha in the struggle, Tata Head done lose his mother
And I'm thinking if I lose mine who gone raise my brothas
Not to be a thug, stay in school, don't use drugs
Who'll teach them right from, show dem boys, true love
So I pray for betta days, face da bombs and da run-a-ways
And I put my guns away and I pray for peace on Sundays
It's crazy ain't it
