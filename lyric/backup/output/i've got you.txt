I, I
Ohh, I

I can be with another girl and I can take a trip all around the world
But why would I go anywhere when I've got you
I can spend my money on fancy clothes
Meet a thousand women doing videos and shows
But, baby, I'm so glad that I've got you

Baby, when I think about you
I don't need to think 'cause I just know
That baby, it's the way you love me
That's make me so damn sure that you're the one
Don't you know that I've waited for you
You're everything I've wanted all my life
Never thought I would find what I need
Till you came along my dream seemed far away, ahea, hey

I can be with another girl and I can take a trip all around the world
 (Another girl)
