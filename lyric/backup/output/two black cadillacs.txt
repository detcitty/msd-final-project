Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time

And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry
Bye Bye, Bye Bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
