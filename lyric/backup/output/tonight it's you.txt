Time's not sleeping and time won't lose
You can't win 'cause time can't lose
So stop (so stop) what you're doin'
Start on something new
Don't (no don't) don't be hypnotized
Don't start thinkin' with your eyes

(I don't know) Why you mean that much to me
(You don't know) What it feels like lovin' you
(We all know) A change is good for you
(That's all right) Gotta do what you gotta do
Anyway-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

All I want is a place in your heart to fall into
