Some of the old gang
We still keep in touch
Relive the memories
We cherish so much
Sit there and laugh
At all the things I did
When I was a kid

Seems only yesterday
The sixties were here
Hot Summer nights
With a six-pack of beer
When I burned up the road
In my Coup Deville
I was the king of the hill
