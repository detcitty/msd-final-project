(Ooooo, Ooooo)
I'm gonna tell you something you don't wanna hear
You never listen when I talk
Maybe you'll listen when I walk
So I made my mind up and made a sandwich
And I didn't shed a tear
I gave you one last minute of my time
In this mess I left behind
When you come home tonight
And turn on the light
Don't you be surprised to find

My little good-byes
Empty hangers by the closet door
Lipstick tube on the bathroom floor
My little good-byes
Unpaid bills by the kitchen phone
