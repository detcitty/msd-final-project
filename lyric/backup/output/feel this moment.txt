Ask for money, and get advice
Ask for advice, get money twice
I′m from the Dirty, but that chico nice
Ya′ll call it a moment, I call it life

One day when my light is glowing I′ll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open I just wanna feel this moment
(ohhh)

I just wanna feel this moment (ohhh)
I just wanna feel this moment
