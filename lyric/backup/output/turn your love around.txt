You've got the love
You've got the power
But you just don't understand
Girl, you've been charging by the hour
For your love

I'm tryin' to show how much I love you
Still believe in romance
You're taking way too many chances
With my love

I remember
When you used to be
The talk of the town
All you get is lonely

Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how
Turn your love around
