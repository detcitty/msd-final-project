Back to Hev, back to the Big Daddy
We be gettin' down for real

Y'all ready, tell me who be that, Heav' Biggie
Girls say he cutie, absolutely jiggy
I be that big fella in the summer sportin' linen
Bacardi and lemon, party with de women

Big Dada, papi grande
6-double-oh pusher, where yo' Honda
My belly stay jigglin', keepin' yo' backside wigglin'
Who bigger in, dis dan me?

Nobody, Heav' Dadi, down to rock the party
I be sendin' chills through yo' body
And y'all ain't seen nuttin' quite like me
I be gettin' down on the M-I-C

Only dimepiece you gon' catch me wit'
Big belly, can you handle it?
Heav' Diggy, niggy, be jiggy
Baby you ready, for Big Daddy?
