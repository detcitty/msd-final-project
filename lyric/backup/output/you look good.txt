On a boat, on a beach
In the water, in the sand, in the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts, breaking necks
When we rolling down the street, heads turning all day when they see you with me
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight

They're like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in
