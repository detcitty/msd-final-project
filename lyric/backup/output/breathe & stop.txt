Get up
For real
Come on
What, what, what, what

A hard time if your motion is still
Let me move some things around because the lyrics is ill
Abstract, you know my stiggidy in here
Niggaz get on and swear it's they fuckin' year
But yo your girl just moved
To the joint in the club, in the car if it groove
Broad look, the movement is on
Mild mannered mami's in Victoria thongs, uh

I give my rhyme a bless
Guaranteed to make it right if your night is a bust
You vibrant and you fresh and all
Original to say the least and you've impressed Kamal, come on
Rappers start then they stall
Findin' it very hard to make it over the wall
Hey, get your weight up, my motto you heard?
And I grown a deaf ear to felonious words, uh
So girls move it around
If you see your main dog give a brother a pound

And just uhh, breathe and stop for real
And give it what you got
And just uhh, breathe and stop for real
And give it what you got
Give it what you got, give it what you got
And if you on the block then give it what you got, uh

A thug, a thrill, you as mean as the eyes
I wanna feel you, them big ass thighs
