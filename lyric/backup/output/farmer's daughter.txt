Well, I heard he needed some help on the farm
Somebody with a truck and two strong arms
Not scared of dirt and willing to work
'Til the sun goes down

So I pulled up and said, "I'm your man
I can start right now" and we shook hands
He said, "The fence needs fixin', the peaches need pickin'
And the cows need bringin' round"

I was haulin' hay, I was feedin' the hogs
And that summer sun had me sweatin' like a dog
So I cooled off in the creek and it was back to work
In that dad-gum heat
