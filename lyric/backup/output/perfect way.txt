I took a backseat, a backhander, I took her back to her room
I better get back to the basics for you, Oh yea
You have a conscience, a compassion, you got a way with the word

You gotta heart full of complacency too
Yes I like that darling
I don't have a purpose or mission, I'm empty by definition
I've got a lack girl that you'd love to be

(Album edition) *You wanna diva a deduction you wanna do what they do
Wanna do damage that you can undo*

(Repeat 1)
Apart from everyone away from your love
