Wild women do
And they don't regret it
Woo

You tell me you want a woman who's
As simple as a flower
Well, if you want me to act like that
You'd better pay me by the hour

Don't want to travel in the danger zone
Take another number
Don't want a lover who can hold her own
Baby, step aside if you don't want to ride
Because
