I just can’t stay
I, I can’t stay
Oh, I can’t stay
Hey!

Oh I can’t stay away from you too long
I hum your face just like a new song
Your smile is like a punch line
The part you sing all the time
Oh I can’t stay away from you too long

You know your name should be Melody baby
‘Cause your personality is, uh, so melodic
I been dreamin’ to the tune of you
