All these kinds of places make it seem like it's been ages
Tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try
Once I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations

We were still alone my wife and I
Before we married saved my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside
But off the boat they stayed awhile then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most
I take a walk
