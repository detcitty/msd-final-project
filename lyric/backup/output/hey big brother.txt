Hey, big brother, as soon as you arrive
You better get in touch with the people, big brother
Better get them on your side, big brother
And keep them satisfied

Welcome to the beat of the city street
Walk on now and don't be shy
Take a closer look at the people you meet
And notice the fear in their eye, yeah
Watchin' the time passin' by

Hey, big brother, as soon as you arrive
