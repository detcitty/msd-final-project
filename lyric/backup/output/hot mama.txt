You're doin' all you can, to get in them old jeans
You want that body back, you had at seventeen
Baby, don't get down, don't you worry 'bout a thing
'Cause the way you fill 'em out, hey, that's all right with me
I don't want the girl you used to be
An' if you ain't noticed, the kids are fast asleep

An' you're one hot mama
You turn me on, let's turn it up
An' turn this room into a sauna
One hot mama
