SOS, she's in disguise
SOS, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
