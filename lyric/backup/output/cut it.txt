Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it

Your price is way too high, you need to cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it

Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it

Run up them bands on the regular
Hittin' my plug on the celly, yeah
Tell my ex bitch that I'm sorry
I'm a skate off in the 'Rari
Keep 36 by my side
I'm a go bake me a pie
Keep 45 on my side
Fuck with my niggas, you die
All of my niggas say blood
All of my niggas say cuh
