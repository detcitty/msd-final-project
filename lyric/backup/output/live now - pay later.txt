I've got a '57 Cadillac with Batmobile wings,
Pink and black striped interior that's fit for a king,
No money down, fifty years to pay, be glad when it's mine,
"Saw you coming!", said the dealer as I signed on the line.

Live now - pay later, Live now - pay later.

I got a fifty room country mansion up in the hills,
My landlord says I can have it, long as I pay the bills.
I bought the furniture on credit at a fabulous store,
The man said, "Next time you come in, why don't you spend a little more?

Live now-pay later, Live now-pay later

How many possesions do I possess?
