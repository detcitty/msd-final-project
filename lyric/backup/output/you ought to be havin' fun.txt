If you're sittin' out there wondering what to do
Me and the fellas got a message for you
(You ought to be havin' fun
You ought to be havin' fun
Put your troubles on the run)
The best things in life are free
(The best things in life are free)
(You ought to be havin' fun)
Makin' someone happy
(You ought to be havin' fun)
It'll make you feel so glad
Go out and love someone
