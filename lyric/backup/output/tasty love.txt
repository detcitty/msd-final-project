Chorus:
Ohh girl the way you do me in the morning
Ohh girl the way you love me all night long
Work my love around and make it all come down
And give me that tasty love mmmm girl
Make it feel so good only you could give me that tasty love

Verse:
Ohh girl you touch a special part of me a part no one else has ever seen
Ohh girl such a feeling that is so intense I had no defense
Girl when you look at me I can tell you see right through me
Cause I loose control of my heart and soul
Girl when you're next to me your sensitivity inside you gets me yearning

Bridge:
Darling, when its right its right it's alright
Darling, keep it there right there ohh yeah

Chorus:
Ohh girl the way you do me in the morning
Ohh girl the way you love me all night long
Work my love around and make it all come down
And give me that tasty love mmmm
