White lies in her blue eyes
Goodbye is on the way
White lies in her blue eyes
Evil's the game she plays
Well, she's trying to tempt you
With her music and her line
Well, her lips look so inviting
And those sultry eyes
They get to shine

Oh, but look a little deeper
At all that come on stare
Then you might be able
To see what's lying there
