(Verse 1: (Jermaine))

I been watching you for so damn long but I don't know what to say or do
I be sittin' around fantasizin' bout' what I wanna do to you
Here's somethin' about the way you move your body I can't take
Specially when you turn around and you make ur ass shake
You da the number one most requested in the club like one of my jams
But no matter what when I come in your right here where I am
Breakin' it down like we in bed
Gotta a nigga spedin' up all his bread
Bendin' over to the front
Lookin' back at me like whatcha want

(Chorus: (Missy & Jermaine))

I gotta getcha getcha getcah getcha
Someday, Someday
I gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha
If it's the last thing that I do
(Repeat)

(Verse 2: (Missy))
