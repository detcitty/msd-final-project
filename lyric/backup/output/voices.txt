You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Till you heard the voices in your ear

Hey, it's me again
Plain, you see again
Please, can I see you every day?
I'm a fool again
I fell in love with you again
Please, can I see you every day?

You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Till you heard the voices in your ear
You didn't know what you were lookin' for
Till you heard the voices in your ear

Words don't come out right
