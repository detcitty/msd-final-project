You hear a new song, it's your favorite
Pretty soon you'll be changing the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance too
Heavy into everything
Ready for the next thing
Catch a ride for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shines gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but

Woahhhhh woahhhh
I ain't gunna be that easy to leave
Woahhhh woahhhh
