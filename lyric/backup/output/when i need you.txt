When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so wanna give you
Is only a heartbeat away
When I need love
I hold out my hand and I touch love

I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
