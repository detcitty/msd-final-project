Overnight scenes, dinner and wine, Saturday girls
I was never in love, never had the time
In my hustle and hurry world
Laughing myself to sleep, waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me, oh

It's such a crazy old town, it can drag you down till you run out of dreams
So you party all night to the music and lights
But you don't know what happiness means
