Some of them men think they freak this like we do

But no they don't
Make your cheques come at they neck
Disrespect us no they won't
Boy don't even try to touch this

Boy this beat is crazy
This is how they made me
Houston, Texas baby
This goes out to all my girls

That's in the club rocking the latest
Who will buy it for themselves and get more money later
I think I need a barber
None of these niggas can fade me
