Love, has finally come my way
You fill my everyday with love, I think I'll stay around
Your sweet love, has brought new life to me
A pair of eyes to see, so I don't have to dream about
Loving you is changing everything
I've got this song to sing,
For You, For Love
Oh girl, thank you for the time, we're spending
