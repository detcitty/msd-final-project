Uh huh, I'm back what cha, uh whatcha gon do now?
I'm the Fireman
Fire, Fa, Fireman
I got that fire I'm hollering
I got that fire come and try me and
You can spark it up and I'ma put you out

You can spark it up and I'ma put you out
(1)
Ain't nobody fuckin with me man, Heatman
Ski Mask spending next weeks cash, he fast
And I don't even need a G pass I'm pass that
I'm passing em out now and you can't have that
And my chain Toucan Sam
That tropical colors you can't match that
Gotta be abstract
You catch my gal legs open betta smash that
Don't be surprise if she ask where the cash at
I see she wearing them jeans that show her butt crack
My girls can't wear that why, that's where my stash at
I put my mack down that's where you lack at
She need her candlelit and I'ma wax that
I rekindle the flame
She remember the name
It's Weezy Baby January December the same
Mama gimme that brain
