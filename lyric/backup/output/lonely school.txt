I drove past where we used to live
You might have caught a glimpse of me, 
As I passed by
I swear it's still hard to believe

But at the time it seemed so clear to me
I thought I had it all worded out
I packed all that was dear to me
And I left without a doubt, (that I'd)

Given it all I had to give
Still nothing moved, nothing changed, nothing lived
I did everything that I could do

But now I've had time to sort it out
To graduate from lonely school
And now I've got to let you know
It's me who was the fool

It was me baby I was wrong
But how can I say it (how)
