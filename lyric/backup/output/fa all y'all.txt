(Verse 1)

I am... quick to pull the trigger quick to pull your card
Hard late for the boulevard
It's Da B to the R A T with the bump
Sendin good vibrations from the trunk to the front
Of your ride (ride) where I live that's what they like (like)
So that's what I give
Somethin for them fools when they crawl and creep
And creep and crawl, it's fa all y'all
Well...

(Hook)
Who's that makin that funky noise?
