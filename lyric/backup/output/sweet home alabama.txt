Turn it up
Big wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the southland
I miss Alabamy once again and I think its a sin yes

(ooh... ooh... ooh...) Well I heard mr. young sing about her
(ooh... ooh... ooh...) Well I heard ole Neil put her down
(ooh... ooh... ooh...) Well I hope Neil Young will remember

A southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama
