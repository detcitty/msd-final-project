Racks in me like a Pinata
Fuck u blue balenciagas
Robin Jeans with the foam posits
Hit the club now my black Barbers
Bloods with me Woo Woo Woo
No set trippin
They kno im crippin' fool
Jesus Pieces 10k gold
Ima fuckn fool you better act cool
German Sheperds in my backyard
Train to kill I was born to deal

One of the rest in Peace Clifford Deal
My daddy backed out u done fucked up
