Don't cry victim to me
Everything we are and used to be is buried and gone
Now it's my turn to speak
It's my turn to expose and release what's been killing me
I’ll be damned fighting you
It's impossible, impossible
Say goodbye with no sympathy

I’m entitled to overcome
Completely stunned and numb
Knock me down, throw me to the floor
There’s no pain; I can't feel no more
I’m entitled to overcome
