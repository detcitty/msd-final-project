I'm not the picture innocence, I claim to be
I've got all my problems, I'm not so clean
I've been hurt, I've been burnt, along the way
I survived, my own life, to tell the tale

I can work on it, pray on it
But it never works
I keep running, back to it
And it hurts my soul

Take it away, make me okay, I pray everyday
