How much is enough?

Good enough's not good enough
Don't complain that you've got it tough
With all you have your life's a bore
Can't relax you want so much more
Blind needs won't set you free
Can't you see that
Time is slipping away?
But I got to say

CHORUS
How much is enough when your soul is empty?
