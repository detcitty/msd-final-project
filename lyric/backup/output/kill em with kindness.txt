The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it (yeah)...
We don't have to fight for grace
Put down the weapons you're fighting

And kill em with kindness...
Kill em with kindness...
Kill em... kill em...
Kill em with kindness...
Kill em with kindness...
Kill em with kindness...
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now...
