I've got my dreams
I know you think that's crazy
But I won't give up
Cause I've got this
Burning desire in me
Oh, baby, it's me

While the world sleeps
I sit up all night thinking
And making my plans
Cause there's something
Special ahead for me
Something ahead for me

So don't you tell me
That I'm wasting my time
Ruining my life and that
The odds against me

Are a million to one
Don't be concerned
I'll take the heat for
All the chances
I'm gonna take
Mistakes that I make

Just wait and see
You're gonna hear from me

Don't wait for heroes
