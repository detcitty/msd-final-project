Let's start tonight out right
You and I bathed in candlelight
Tasting the wine on your lips
Touching your body tenderly with my fingertips

I feel a sweet sensation rushing through my body
Needs no explaining, it's for your lovin'
Just dim the lights and ask me what I want, oh baby
So I can say exactly how I feel

I'm in the mood
Feels so, so good to me
Take me away
Makes me feel oh so right
I'm in the mood
Feels so, so good to me
Feels so good to me
Makes me feel oh so right

Let's not spoil the moment, boy
