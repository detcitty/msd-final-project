From my nigga Diddy view, I think I see his vision too
Purple Rain over Central Park, chillin' with my goons
Big Pops and Sades, Cirocs and Chardonnay
My Cassie's sassy, so my penthouse my balloon

We doin' it big, it's goin' down, 9/11
I'm doin' it big, pullin' up in a 911
I been tryna fuck for months, baby girl, it's now or never
Got the condo on the beach, hope through our storms we shall weather

We shinin' when it's pitch dark
Yeah, this bitch a movie but this time I play a big part
Fuck the marketing, look at what I'm accomplishin'
I'm beatin' niggas by margins bigger than Fran Tarkenton

All these cars, all these stars all around me
(Super high)
Put your eye to the sky, that's where you'll find me
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

'Cause we are, we are super high
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
(Bring your sexy ass here, baby)
