You can't buy it at the store, try it on for size,
bring it back if it don't feel right.
No, love... love ain't like that.

You can't trade it in like an automobile,
That's got too many miles and rust on the wheel,
no love... love ain't like that.

Love, ain't that easy to define.
You can't build it by design,
it takes its own sweet time.
