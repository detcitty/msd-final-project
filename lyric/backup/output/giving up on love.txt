Giving up on love
Giving up on love

I was so crazy about you
Everyone knew
I couldn't sleep when I found out, yeah
You feel the way you do

So maybe it's my turn now
To show you how I feel
So listen to what I say
'Cause these feelings I can't conceal

I'm giving up on love
'Cos I've been hurt before
Giving up on love
And I don't want you no more

Giving up on love
'Cos I've been hurt before
