Fight!
Hey
God damn... I'm winning
God damn! I'm winning
Got money now you done switched up on me

I used to think about how you would act
When a nigga got money
Now you done switched up on me
Now you wanna say "what's up?" to me
Okay so now you wanna make love to me

Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had something special
But you don't mean nothing to me
Girl I'm sorry you not the one for me

Just be honest, girl what you want from me?
This ain't nothing new, keep it so 100
I can't let none of these niggas get one up on me
I go by God Tiller, you better run from me
Give hope to my niggas, them niggas blood money
Adios to them bitches, can't get a hug from me
I'm high on life, that's what it does for me
My numbers going up, I feel a buzz coming (one up)
