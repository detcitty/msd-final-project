Just seventeen, everything that she's seen
Is all there in her eyes
So many years of her poor mama's tears
And her daddy's red eyes
But there's nobody home
And Maryann's alone
Almost fully grown, and worldly wise
Jimmy's been down, he's been out and around
And he knows where it's at
Love would be good if he thought that he could
But it isn't like that
He don't make mistakes
