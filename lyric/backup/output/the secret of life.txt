Couple of guys sittin' 'round drinking
down at the Starlight Bar.
One of em' says, "You know I've been thinking..."
Other one says, "That won't get you too far."
He says, "This is your life, and welcome to it.
It's just working and drinking and dreams.
Ad on TV says 'Just Do It.'
Hell if I know what that means."

The secret of life is a good cup of coffee,
the secret of life is keep your eye on the ball.
The secret of life is a beautiful woman;
Marilyn stares down from the barroom wall.
