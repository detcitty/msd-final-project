Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big, and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are

And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
The crazy kids, them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
The crazy kids, we are the
We are the crazy people

I see ya in the club showin' Ke$ha love
Ain't trippin' on them bitches that be hatin'
Catch a dub, chuckin' deuces
Ya'll hating's useless
It's such a nuisance
Ya'll chickens keep your two cents
And keep your dollars, keep your loot
I'm fresher than that Gucci
Them boys, they want my coochie
I say no, I'm no hoochie
Your home girl hatin', I say who she?
