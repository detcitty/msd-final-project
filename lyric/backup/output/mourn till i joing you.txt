It's gonna be alright, you gotta believe dat

Dear God times are changing and the weather got hot
Over the past year a lot of niggas went pop drop
So I thank you for my life and all that I got
I wanna praise you and drop off a message to Pac

I was sittin' here lookin' at your picture my nigga
Puttin' hash with the weed wit a mixture of liquor
We can't kick it you ain't wit us is the shit I can't figure
Nigga I miss ya this thug gonna miss ya till I'm wit cha'

It was 90 on the P.E. tour when we mashed down
Doesn't even seem like 7 years passed
Both rodies now homies out the hood on the scene
You did the Humpty with the u I did the walk wit the queen

Was a dream smokin' and drinkin?
Stealin' backstage passes to hit ho's and coleseums
[Unverified] the flip up make them lift they shit up
Get it the get up lift the trix up and switch up

Think of all the times that I rolled wit mine
Male groupies got dissed and got the hell out of dodge
They was blinded when the good shined through they were on you
Just know I'm gonna mourn you till I join you

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in God we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you 'til I join you 'cause I'll keep in touch

Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in God we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you 'til I join you 'cause I'll keep in touch

We was two lil' niggas both skinny and broke
Happy if we scrap pennies for smokes
Tours over we were out yeah and you called with the news
You was over in New York to film this movie called juice
