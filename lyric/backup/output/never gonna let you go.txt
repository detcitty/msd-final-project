If I had one wish boy
I'd wish you next to me.
and it could be in summer, fall, or spring, boy
'cause you make my heart sing.

I wanna give my heart, my soul, my love to you, oh baby, yeah.
'Cause every day I'm not with you, I'm missing you like crazy.

I need for you to love me, (love me)
hold me, (hold me)
touch me, (touch me)
down deep in my soul, I'll never let it go
