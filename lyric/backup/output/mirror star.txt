He was a lonely boy, no good at sports
He couldn't run, his legs were short
He walked the streets inside his head
And spent a lot of time in bed

He practiced on his way to school
His friends all said, you're off the wall
He played a tight elastic band
His mic was just his empty hand

(CHORUS)
Mirror, mirror, mirror star
He posed in front of every car
They all called him crazy kid
He ran up to his room and hid
