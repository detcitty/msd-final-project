Just Let Me Be In Love
(Tom Shapiro, Mark Nessler, Tony Martin)

English Version

My breath is short, my heart is beating fast
Every time I smile at her she's smiling back
If I'm dreaming, please just let me sleep
Anyone can see that she's too good for me
Oh, give her time, she'll find out soon enough
Just let me have and hold her 'til she does
