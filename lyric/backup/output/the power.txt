I've got the power

I've got the power... hey yeah heh
Like the crack of the whip I snap attack
Front to back in this thing called rap
Dig it like a shovel rhyme devil

On a heavenly level
Bang the bass turn up the treble
Radical mind day and night all the time
Seven to fourteen wise divine

Maniac brainiac winning the game
I'm the lyrical Jesse James
