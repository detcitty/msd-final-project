Girl, you're such a bad thang
Standing there all alone
Looking so good to me baby
Can't do no wrong (hey baby)

Put your arms around me
Set my world on fire
There ain't never gonna be nobody like you baby
Honey, that's no lie! (hey honey)

You put that spell on me
I'll tell you, honey
You know you set me free
Hey, little girl
You know my hearts diseres
Come on and give it to me, baby
I can't deny ya!

Hey, hey, what I'm sayin' is
Do it to me one more time
Oh, give ya one more chance
This heart of mine
Do it to me one more time, baby
