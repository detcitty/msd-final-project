Pump up the jam pump it up
While your feet are stomping
And the jam is pumpin'
Look ahead the crowd it's jumping

Pump it up a little more
Let the party going on the dance floor
See 'cause that's where the party's at and
You'll find out if you do that

I want, a place to stay
'Get your booty on the floor tonight'
Make my day
I want, a place to stay
'Get your booty on the floor tonight'
Make my day

Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day

Yo, pump up the jam, pump it up
While your feet are stomping
And the jam is pumping
Look ahead the crowd is jumpin'

Pump it up a little more
Let the party going on the dance floor
See 'cause that's where the party's at and
You'll find out if you do that
