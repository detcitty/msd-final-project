Now go stand in the corner
And think about what you did
...
Ha

...
Time for a little revenge
...
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer

And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it

I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
...

She's not a saint, and she's not what you think
