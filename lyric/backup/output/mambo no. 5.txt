Ladies and gentlemen
This is Mambo number 5

One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car so come let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don't wanna

Beer bust like I had last week
I must stay cheap 'cause talk is a cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And I, as I continue you know they're getting sweeter

So what can I do I really beg you my Lord
To me flirtin' is just like a sport
Anything fly is all good let me dump it
