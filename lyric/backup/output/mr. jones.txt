[Hook]
You can ride all day long
Another mike dizzle production(Mike Jones)
But you'll never catch Mr. Jones ha ha ha ha ha haaa(Mr. Jones)
He's got a shot gun so (Who?) go back home (Who? Who? Who?)
Cuz you'll never (Who?) catch Mr. Jones(Who?) (Mike Jones)

[Verse 1]
I'm back on these tracks about to sell another mill
My pants stay saggin' from them hundred dollar billz
These haters hate but they don't really wanna see the steel
These haters hate but they don't really wanna see the steel
Had a million in my bank before Asylum bought the deal
Had a million in my bank before Asylum bought the deal
Before I came out they say the streets wouldn't feel
The shit that I'm spittin the shit that's real
But now I'm like Mello I'm the king of the hill
American dream im livin' that for real
eleven cars lata nigga tell me how you feel
Took the diamonds out my teeth and put them on my phantom grill (Smile, ha ha)
