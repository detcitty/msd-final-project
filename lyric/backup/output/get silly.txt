Soulja Boy Tellem

The dance floor silly
The ladies gon’ feel me
The fellas in the back
And they twistin’ up a philly

Get silly, get silly
Get silly, get silly
Get silly, get silly
Get silly, get silly, get silly

The dance floor silly
The ladies gon’ feel me
The fellas in the back
And they twistin’ up a philly

The dance floor silly
The ladies gon’ feel me
The fellas in the back
And they twistin’ up a philly

My chain’ too silly, my wrist too silly
The girls throw me ish cuz my rims big willy
My ride too silly, I ride too silly
We for fantastic cuz I got a deally

Cuz now I’m worth a milly
Forget a rubber band cuz you can’t put a rubber band around a billion
