Dear darlin' surprised to hear from me?
bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily
just to let you know
i'm gonna be home soon
i'm kinda awkward and afraid
time has changed your point of view
how you gonna see me now
please don't see me ugly babe
'cause i know i let you down
in oh so many ways
how you gonna see me now
