Chris Brown, you set it off

Oh, feeling crazy
The moon is up
The night is hazy
Let's get lost in the shadows
Somewhere we can go
And no one else can find

Loosen up your body till you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone
Loosen up your body till you come undone
Loosen up your body baby come undone

Oh my my, looking like a good good time
Don't disguise
The way you wanna love tonight
Oh my my, you with a brand new high
Don't be shy, I just wanna live tonight
Live a little F.U.N. fun
