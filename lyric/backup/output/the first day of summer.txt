Well, the kid and me
Were the team to beat
We could stand with the big boys
Generate some heat

And we never thought nothing
'Bout living on the street back then

Yes, and we lied a little
And we maybe stole some
Saying, Southern California
Here we come

And we took off
Down the highway saying
Never going back again

It was on the
First day of summer
