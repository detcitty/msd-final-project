You know, I can't get no more
(Satisfaction)
Girl, you know you won't give me no more
(Inspiration)
Listen to me
Lord, have mercy!

You know that I lost that
(Lovin' Feelin')
But you don't see me
Packin' up my clothes
(Goin' and leavin')

(Woo-woo, woo-woo-woo)
It's better to have and don't need
Yes, better
(Than need and don't have)
(It's better to have and don't need)
Whoa, when you ain't got nobody
(Than need and don't have)
You know
(A man without a woman)
Yes, sho'
(Sho' gonna feel bad)

Girl, you caused me so much
