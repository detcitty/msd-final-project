The night's alive with wind and fire
We telegraph our heart's desire
Through the night with our eyes

Wheels are turning fast and hard
Hearts are burnin' on the Boulevard
Hear them pound, young and proud
It's the American Heartbeat

Chart the stars, head out for the action
Hit the streets and find some satisfaction

It's the American Heartbeat
The American Heartbeat
It's the American Heartbeat
Oh, the American Heartbeat
