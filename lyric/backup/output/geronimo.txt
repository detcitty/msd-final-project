Can you feel it?
Now it's comin' back
We can steal it
If we bridge this gap
I can see ya
Through the curtains of the waterfall

When I lost it
Yeah, you held my hand
But I tossed it
Didn't understand
You were waitin'
As I dove into the waterfall

So say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
Say Geronimo

Can you feel
My love
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away

Can you feel
My love, my love, my love, my love
Bombs away
