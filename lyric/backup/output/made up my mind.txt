I still remember when I was young
Someone always had me under their thumb
But now I'm breaking free, a feeling inside of me
Its my decision I'm taking control
My intuition is letting me know
Its time to put myself first on the list
I wanna give all I have to give
Gonna live like I wanna live
I'm taking chances I've never taken before
