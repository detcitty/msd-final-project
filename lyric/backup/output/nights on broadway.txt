Here we are
In a room full of strangers
Standing in the dark
Where your eyes couldn't see me

Well, I had to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my lovin' you
I can't stay away

Blaming it all
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs
Singing them straight-to-the-heart songs
Blaming it all
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town

Now in my place
