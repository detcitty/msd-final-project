Said I'm scared, Lord I'm scared, I'm terrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough would like to hear the call

I'm scared, Lordy Lord, I'm shakin', I'm petrified
Never been much on religion
But I sure enough just fell down on my knees

I heard the singin'
Something about good will toward men
And even
sleepin' in heavenly peace
