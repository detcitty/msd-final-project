Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit feelin' light, 2 am summer night.
I don't care, hand on the wheel, driving drunk, I'm doin' my thing
Rollin the Midwest side and out livin' my life getting' out dreams

People told me slow my roll I'm screaming out fuck that
Imma do just what I want lookin' ahead no turnin' back

If I fall if I die know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall if I die know I lived and missed some bullets
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know

everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it, yeah
