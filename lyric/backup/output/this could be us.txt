Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Hey, Sremm life

I've done it before, I've seen it before
Tears splashin' the floor when I opened the door for her
She acted like a whore and I'ma let her
Learn from Project Pat uh pimpin' got her masters
Girl, improvise, look me in my eyes and lie to me
Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything
Sex on the beach and in the backseat
This could be us

So back to what I was saying (Money make the world go round)
This could be us but you're playing, (Money make your girl go down)
This could be us but you're playing, (Money make the world go round)
I'm high, I hope I don't sound crazy (Money make your girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas were saying, (Money make the world go round)
This could be us but you playing, (Money make your girl go down)
