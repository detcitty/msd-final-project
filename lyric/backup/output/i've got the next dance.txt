I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance, with you
Oh I'll be waiting on you, all night
I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance, with you, with you

Sitting here, I've been drinkin' gins
Thought I'd have me some fun.
Feeling free, really
While the night's still young.

Oh I've been watching you (watching you)
I'm waiting to (waiting to)
Well I've got this in hand.
There's a star (There's a star)
In your smile (In your smile)
You fit right into my plan.

I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance, with you
Oh I'll be waiting on you, all night
I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance, with you, with you.
