(Ralph Tresvant)
Lonely fear lights up the sky
Can't help but wonder why

(Ralph Tresvant & Randy Travis)
You're so far away

(Celine Dion)
There, you had to take a stand
In someone else's land
Life can be so strange

(Peter Cetera)
I wish we never had to choose
To either win or lose
We could find a way

(Bobby Brown)
We could find a way

(Brenda Russell)
But I won't turn my back again

(Bobby Brown)
Turn my back again

(Brenda Russell)
Your honor I'll defend

(Jani Lane:)
So hurry home till then

(Luther Vandross)
(Till Then)

Chorus:
Stand tall, stand proud
Voices that care
