She paints her nails
And she don't know
He's got her best friend on the phone
She'll wash her hair
His dirty clothes
Are all he gives to her

And he's got posters on the wall
Of all the girls he wished she was
And he means everything to her

Her boyfriend
He don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned
