Girl I know he ain't takin' care of you
I can see it in your face
And I know that's not the man
That you really want, you know
So if you sick and tired of him
Then come see me
I'm a better man anyway
Lies and deceived, I know
You feel this wit your man
'Cause with him all I see is cryin'
I should be your boyfriend
(I should be your boyfriend)
'Cause you know he's lyin'
('Cause you know he's lyin')
It might seem like I'm hatin'
(It might seem like I'm hatin')
But girl I'm just relatin', whoa
Step one walk through that door
Step two tell him
He's not like he was before
You don't love him anymore
Now three come to me
Step four I'll love you more
