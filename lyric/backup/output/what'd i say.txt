Hey, mama
Don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy
All night long

All right now
Hey, hey, all right

See the girl
With the diamond ring
She knows how to
Shake that thing

All right now
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Tell your mama
Tell your pa
I'm gonna send you
Back to Arkansas

Oh, yes, now
You don't do right
Don't do right
Aww, play it boys

When you see me in misery
