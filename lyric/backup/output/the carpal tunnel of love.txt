We take sour sips from life's lush lips
& we shake, shake, shake the hips in relationships
Stomp out this disaster town!
You'll put your eyes to the sun & say, I know
You're only blinding to keep back what the clouds are hiding
& we might've started singing just a little soon
We're throwing stones at a glass moon
Whoa
We're so miserable & stunning

Whoa
Love songs for the genuinely cunning
Whoa
