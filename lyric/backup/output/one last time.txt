I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to, you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without, you

So one last time
I need to be, the one, who takes you home
One more time
