Oh, oh, yeah
I got to tell you something

Hey, girl, let me tell you something
I swear every word is true
When your man stay out all night long
There must be something wrong with you

The other woman's doing your job
She could be Miss Pompous every day
She give him good loving in the morning
In the evening, in the midnight hour
When he need it, that's why
He never turn away

Let me ask you something else
If somebody can steal a jet plane
Baby, right from out of the sky
If you ain't doing what
You're supposed to do
