Oh hot damn, this is my jam
Keep me partying till the a.m.
Y'all don't understand
Make me throw my hands
In the ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer

Oh hot damn, this is my jam
Keep me partying till the a.m.
Y'all don't understand
Make me throw my hands
In the ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer

Hey this my jam
Y'all don't understand
I'll make you understand
What's pumpin' in my CD player, player
Party all night like yayer, yayer
Shawty got her hands in the ayer, ayer
Make me want to take it dare

Then I go, here I go, here this my song
DJ bring it back, I'm in my zone
I keep payed for that cop and them bones
When they guap until the early mornin'

I need that coke when I'm up in the club
Even my Chevy that pull up on dubs
Give me that drop ya know bass like the drug
Ya momma hot if she might show me love
Oh hot damn
Celebrate to the A.M.
My love is so much it's got me saying
