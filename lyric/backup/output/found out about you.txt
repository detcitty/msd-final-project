All last summer, in case you don't recall,
I was yours and you were mine
Forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?
All the lines you wrote to me were lies

Months roll past the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
The things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won
