Secret.
Secret.

I've got a secret and I can't explain
all the time I've waited for this day
all along I was never in doubt
I've always knew it could ever get out
There are things that I cannot tell
and there are things that you know damn well
This is getting very hard for me
I guess you'd better just wait and see
