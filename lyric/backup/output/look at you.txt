Baby when I look at you, with them baby blues
Cuttin' right through me
You set me on the rewind, back to the good times
When you couldn't get enough of me
I guess I givin' myself away
Sayin' all the things I never did say
I lose myself, there's nothing else I can do
Baby, when I look at you

Yeah, baby when I look at you

Last thing I thought I'd see was
You across the bar from me
And holdin' on to that turkey bottle
Shootin' em down, and runnin' full throttle
Oh I can still taste the last time
You and me and nothin' but the tan lines
Keeps runnin' through my my mind
On and on and on and on and
