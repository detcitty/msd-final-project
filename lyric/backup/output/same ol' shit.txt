Same old shit every day and every night
Then when it gets dark niggaz get outa sight
Make sure the AK's locked up tight
'Cuz Ain't no tellin' yo' some shit might pop tonight

"This type o' shit it happends every day" [from la di da di / Doug E Fresh]

Same old shit every morning when I wake
I'm thinkin' of another bitch's money to take
I start to get dressed, Yo my bitch is still asleep
Go put the 9 milimeter gun in the jeep
And let it blow 'em up in hard coffee day
I wish somebody wake 'em up and have somethin' to say
I take out my dick, beat my girl right away
Grab a hand against the bitch and tell her 'have a nice day'
Then go around the corner cuz I fuck her best friend
It ain't a bitch down I don't put my dick in
I can't stay long I gotta hit the blvd.
Put your fist in your pussy bitch and breath real hard
Go to the shack with the G'z that's mega'
Gettin' drunk
Niggaz can't take it alwayz havin' a fit
Yo, but it's the same old shit .

Same old shit every day and every night
