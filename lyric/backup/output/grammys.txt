Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Jheeze, yeah
Right, look, look

Tell me how you really feel
Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But you don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard you never claimed the hood
Hear the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big that they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin'
Yeah, Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lot of sides on the same side
OVO we a gold mine
But I'm goin' gold in no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off
