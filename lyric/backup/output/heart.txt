Out of control, totally out of control
Mmm, stick it where it hurts
Girl, I'll be peeling you off the ceiling
That's right, hee hee
Ladies and gentlemen, Neneh Cherry

Well you laughed at me right in my face
At the wrong time and in the wrong place
You turned around and said, "I'm all shook up"
Said to me, "I'm your sweet buttercup"
You're lying, you're lying, begging him to stay and crying
You're lying, you're lying, you're never satisfied

Heart, heart you can't break my heart
Hard, hard you think you're so hard
If you meant what you, did it wouldn't been half as bad
But you did it in spite and that just isn't right

You took my man, the only one I ever had
You took my man, I didn't treat you bad
Anyway, it's gonna get you anyway
