Nineteen ninety
Chubb rock jumps up on the scene
With a lean
And a pocket full of green
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
But robocop last year was a shock
The tone of the popeye cut shook your butt
Kids are screaming; the media says, "what...
"kind of music is this for you to dance to? "
The man with the plan and the man demands you
Leave the smack and the crack for the wack
Or the vile and the nine; keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store
And ignore temptation
Sent by the nation
Racial gain causes pain; need a new rep
In your hearts and minds never forget yusef
Hawkins
And you're walking
You don't just run
Black on black; remember that; it's important
Anyway the shunless one brings forth the fun
No hatred; the summer's almost done
No time for sleep
Jump in your jeep
