Are you for real
Like how I feel
Can we share a love
To last forever
And if so
Let me know

This feelin that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try, is all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love, last forever more

Baby you told me that you loved me and you'd never leave my side
To the bitter end, through the thick and thin
You promised me baby that you wasn't goin anywhere
Baby keep it real, let me know just how you feel

This feelin that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just, to pass us by
Try, is all we have to do
