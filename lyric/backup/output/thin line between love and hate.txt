It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

It's five o'clock in the morning
I'm just gettin' in
I knock on the door
A voice sweet and low says (who is it?)
She opened up the door
and let me in

And never once does she say "where have you been?"

She says "Are you hungry honey, did you eat yet,
Let me hang up your coat, you wanna tell me pass me your hat"
