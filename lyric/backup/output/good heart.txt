Ooh...
(Give a good heart, give a good heart,
Give a good heart, give a good heart)

When it seems that all hope is gone
And so called friends aren't there to rely on
When the darkness makes it so hard to see
Just lift up your eyes, you will see me - yeah

Chorus:
And I'll give a good heart, to hold you so strong
I'll give you my shoulder to lean on - yeah
Gonna give a good heart, that's solid and true
