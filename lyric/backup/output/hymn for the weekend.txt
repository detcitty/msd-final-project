Drink from me, drink from me (oh-ah)
Shoot across the sky (pour on a symphony)
So high, so high (you said)
That we shoot across the sky

Drink from me, drink from me (ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky (now I'm feeling drunk and high)
Symphony (so high, so high)
That we shoot across the sky

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up

Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
