ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh
ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh
ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh
ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh

Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our Rice Krispies

We can't hear anything at all
Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
