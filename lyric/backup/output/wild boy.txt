Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-o
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth I need o's
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-o
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-o
I'm a wild boy, I'ma I'ma wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth I need o's
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-o
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-o
I'm a wild boy, I'ma I'ma wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth I need o's

(MGK)
Kells
I'm an East side Cleveland wild boy (East side Cleveland wild boy)
We got baseball bats like the Indians and my team pop off like cowboys
You're a white flag, throw that towel boy
I'm a jump right in that crowd boy
You're a Shhh! keep it down boy
And I'm a fuck you blow that loud boy
All I know is how to kill every one of my selves
All they know is they can kill anybody but Kells
I am untouchable, you would think I was in jail
But I'm in Mexico getting marijuana from Miguel
Bring it back into the states, put it on a scale
Measure out a half a eighth, put it in a shell
Split it then I roll it and light it up like it's Independence Day
I got a bottle rocket, put it in the air
Snap back with my city on it
