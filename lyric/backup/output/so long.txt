Nevermind the reason, you may never know
Blame it on the seasons, they come and go
Blame it on the weather, something in the wind
Blame it on whatever, it might have been

You can say, you know what happened
You can say, that I was wrong
You can say, most anything you want to
You can say, I just say so long, so long, so long

Say it doesn't matter, say it's all for fun
