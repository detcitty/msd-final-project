We were drawn from the weeds
We were brave like soldiers
Falling down under the pale moonlight
You were holding me like someone broken
And I couldn't tell you but I'm telling you now
Just let me hold you while you're falling apart
Just let me hold you and we'll both fall down
Fall on me
Tell me everything you want me to be
Forever with you
Forever in me
Ever the same
