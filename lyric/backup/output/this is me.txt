This is me (this is me...) this is me
Ah... yeah... (this is me) c'mon... 

She stole your heart
Only did it because she could
Chewed you up and slapped you around
That girl never was no good
Baby I will never do that
I'll love you faithfully
But your suspicious mind thinks
I'm gonna repeat her story

It's making you crazy
Making you a wreck
Making you follow me
Making me a suspect
You seem to think I'm playing her game
Don't you know my name

Chorus:
That was her, this is me
We're as different as can be
She and I we're nothing alike
You're confusing day with night
That was then, this is now
You wanna trust me,
