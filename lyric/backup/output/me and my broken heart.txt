All I need is a little love in my life
All I need is a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart

Yeah...

Shot gun, aim at my heart, you got one
Tear me apart in this song
How do we call this love
I tried, to run away but your eyes
Tell me to stay a while
Why do we call this love

It seems like we've been losing control
