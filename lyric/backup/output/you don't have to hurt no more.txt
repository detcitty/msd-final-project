I don't like the way he treats you
That's not the way that I would do you
What gives him the right to say
Its you that he owns

All those nights he left you to cry
Left you with nothing but tears in your eyes
Girl just come with me
'Cause this house is not a home

Girl he's over and gone
You don't have to hurt no more
And I'll be there for you
To give all the love you're yearning for

And you don't have to hurt no more, baby he's over
I'll be what you're looking for
Let me take over
