Sometimes a girl will come and go
You reach for love but life won't let cha know
That in the end, you'll still be lovin' her
But then she's gone. You're all alone

I never learned, to give myself
I've been a fool, but right now I need someone else well well well

Just like boy blue I, I blow my horn if you

just lead me home.
Baby, I should have known.

It takes a fool, to learn
That love don't love nobody
It takes a fool, to learn
That love don't love no one
It takes a fool (sometime's ya gotta suffer) to lean
That love (make ya bed warm gotta sleep yeah well, well) don't love no one
It takes a fool (aww yes it does) to lean
That love don't love no one (no one, no one)
Sign of pain is on my face, well
My heartbeat stops
But I won't take the blame, no no
I gave her all the love, I had within
