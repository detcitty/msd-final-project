How can I find somebody else
If I can't
Love myself to know
When it time
Time to let go ooo

I done went through just about two bags of tissues baby
And you're looking at me like you ain't the issue baby
And though I tried to leave
I cant stop missing you baby
And I keep coming
I keep coming back

We going in circles, circles
Round and round
And while he doing you so wrong
You just keep holding him down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what can I say
But I wanna go
I wanna go
But I keep coming back
