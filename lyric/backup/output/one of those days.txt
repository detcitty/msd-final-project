Na na, na na na na
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, ohh
Ohh, this is just for me
Na na, na na na, na na, na na na

Kick off my shoes and relax my feet
Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat
Now, it's been one of those crazy weeks
And I gotta do somethin' special for me

See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Gotta take time out
And all my real ladies know what I'm talkin' about, sing

Ooh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now, ooh, baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

One of those days
When the sun is shinin' bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

One of those days
