Anything you want me to
I will live or die, you choose
This I swear

Only love, I will live
Only love, I will give
Only love, I will live
Only love, I will give

Only love can make me do
What I don't wanna do
Only love, I will live, only love

You know I? m not much on words
But I got to tell you how I feel
(Open your eyes, don? t try to hide my love)

So hard to say but I think it? s best
Gotta give your heart it's time to heal
(When you're ready, I? ll be there)

Sometimes I try and sometimes I cry
Only love make me do
What I don? t wanna do
Anything you want me to
I will live or die, you choose

I? m serious when I tell you love
That a little heartbreak is ten to a dime
(Don? t be afraid, just turn the page my love)
