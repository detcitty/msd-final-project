Jigga man, Swizz Beats
History in the making, part three
Lights out ladies!

Chorus: (2x)

C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (to all my baby thugs)
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Hold me tight and call me your lady (say it louder)
Let me scream your name

[Jay-Z]
I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters
Busters they wanted to rush us
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
You can light up the whole room, turning day from night
When the summertime is in and the tops are down
