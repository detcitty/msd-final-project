Radio Killa, Big Snoop D O dub
The American Dream

Ayo nephew, come up off them keys
Sing a lil' somethin' for the ladies
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Let 'em know how we feelin' right now

Every time I go around, shawty love me down
Run off on me like click clack, throw it out like take that
She make it do what it do when we doin'
What we do in back of the 'Lac, I'm like I'm up all for that
And every night her body gets strapped how 'bout

That gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta, gang, gangsta
Gangsta, gang, gangsta
That gangsta love

Yeah, she love it the way I put it on her
Blowin' trees, summer breeze, sippin' na
Lost dog I give it to her right and she like it
She on the hip like a psychic, izzy

One of the coolest of fool on the flow
I whispered in her ear, come here you ready to go?
I bowled up a winna and put it up in the air
Got that low dress on you comin' up outta there, yeah

She like that, you like that
You say you bite, well, I bite back
And I'm all go, we can do it till tomorrow
I beat it up like Harpo

Snoopy, I go hard, baby, yes
