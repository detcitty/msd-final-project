Ohh, oooh
Ohh, ohhh
Yeah, right there
No, right there

*giggles*
I'm having fun
I hope you're having fun too
My body is your party, baby
Nobody's invited but you, baby

I can do it slow now

Tell me what you want
Baby, put your phone down
You should turn it off
Cause tonight it's going down

Tell your boys it's going down
We in the zone now, don't stop

Oooooh oooh
