Hmmm, hmmm
Yeah
Oh Baby, hmmm
Hang on in there, baby
(Give me love tonight)
Don't be afraid, baby, ooooh

You know we can't help but make it, ooh my love
You know we can't help but make it
Now that we've caressed a kiss so warm and tender
I can't wait till we reach that sweet moment of surrender
Oh we'll hear the thunder roar, feel the lightning strike
At a point we'll both decide to meet at the same time tonight
