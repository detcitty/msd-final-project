All my life been po' but it really don't matter no mo'
And they wonder why we act this way, Nappy Boys gon' be okay
All my life been po' but it really don't matter no mo'
And they wonder why we act this way, Nappy Roots gon' be okay, okay

We came in the game, plain ya see
Average man when the rest was ashamed to be
Nappy head and all, ain't no changin' me

So rough it was, downright wrong I tell ya
Nobody never gave us nothin' but tough time and made us somethin'
Different stretch of road, new somethin' to see
Every state on the map, a different somethin' to eat

Daps and handshakes, it meant nuttin' for real
Everybody makin' a killin' man, showin' no feelin's
Walkin' off collectin' pay, it's the way of the world
Can't change it, so I guess I'm gon' pray for the world

Sometimes I ask myself, was I made for the world?
I scream this to you, and I say it to the world
Nappy then, Nappy now, Nappy for a bit
Knee-deep, head over heels in this country shit
