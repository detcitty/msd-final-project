She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklin's, she wants Aretha
She don't really care how you're spending your money, it's all how you treat her
She just wanna a friend to be there when she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying

Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That's how you get with the lady who's worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your mama
