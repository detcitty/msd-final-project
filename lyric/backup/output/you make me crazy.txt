Fill me up to the top and take me away
To some little hidin' place in old Monterey
'Cause you, you make me crazy

Can't keep my hands off you, can't leave you alone
You've got the sweetest smile and a style of your own
And you, mmm, you make me crazy
Yeah, you, you make me crazy

Oh well, I don't wanna know about your past
