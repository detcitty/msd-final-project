Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain
Call him Mr. Raider call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane
He'd say: I know what I want
and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want and I want it now
I want you cause I'm Mr. Vain
Call me Mr. Raider call me Mr. Wrong
Call me insane call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like
As long as you call me time and again
Fell the presence of the aura
of the man none to compare
