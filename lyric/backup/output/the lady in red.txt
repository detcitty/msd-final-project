I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance,
given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes

I have been blind

The Lady In Red
is dancing with me
(Cheek to cheek)
