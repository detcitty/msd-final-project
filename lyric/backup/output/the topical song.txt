When I was young
All the gas was so plentiful
Bountiful, oh, liberal
My tank was full

And all the pumps on the street
They would dangle so happily
Joyfully, oh, playfully filling me

And then a shortage arose
And I tried to be sensible
Logical, economical, responsible

And now they doubled the price
