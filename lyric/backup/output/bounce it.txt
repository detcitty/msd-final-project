Yeah
Yeah, we gon' stay trippy for life, mane
Yeah
I'm 'bout to take yo' girl (bounce it)
Check it
Bounce it, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand

Bounce it, bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
Yes sir!, bounce it
I'm about to throw a couple thousand
I love the way she slow dance, she make me throw more bands
Grabbing ass with both hands, she in love with the dope man
She wanna be my main chick
I was thinking different, different

Clap that ass, light our blunt
Baby, let's get ig'nant, ig'nant
She's strips for the Gs, rake cash like leaves
She got double Ds, and ain't shit free
Came with my goons but I'm leaving with a diva
With an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms
She ain't finished college, she a head doctor

Bouncing ass while I'm getting high as propellers on a helicopter
Let's do it again (again)
Me, you and your friend (friend)
We don't even need a room, give me head up in my Benz (in my Benz)
