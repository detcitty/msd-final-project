Yeah
This is like the old times
I know a lot of you all out there can relate to the old times
This is one for you
Yeah
Listen

If I take you back in the room
Spend you around
My Baby
Take off your clothes and all of mine too
Lay you down
way down
We could be discrete nobody have to know
We don't need no sheets we can just close the door my baby
I can take you places you ain't been before
Soon as we get there baby
You'll be coming back for more, 'Cause

If ain't good enough, good enough baby
I'll work harder
I'll keep pumpin every minute girl
And baby I'll do you up, do you up baby
And I will not stop till I know you're hot
