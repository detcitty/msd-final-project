Before I met ya baby I don't know how I got along
Other lovers were just words to another lonely song
I was tired of singin' the same old tune for so long
You rewrote the melody. now it feels just right for me

I... I can't stop this feelin'
... comin' over me
... I have finally found a feel for love
With just a touch of your love baby I feel it come again
