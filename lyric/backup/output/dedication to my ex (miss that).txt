Hey ya'll

I went away for a while and
She gave my love away huh
I really shouldn't blame her
But now that lovin' is a stranger

Baby, somethings on my mind I gotta say it
Yeah, Your lovin' done changed
It ain't the same girl and thats a shame
(A crying shame baby)
Oooh, aint being funny

Ooh, baby, that lovin' done changed
It's such a shame girl and thats a shame
(who the hell you giving my loving to girl?)

Oooh Nooo

Cause it don't feel the same no more
(I miss that lovin', that lovin', that lovin', that lovin')
