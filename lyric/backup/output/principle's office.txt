Now normally if I can help
I don't spend a lot of time in a principal's office
What? 9'o clock

Now as I get to school, I hear the late bell ringin'
Runnin' through the halls, I hear the Glee Club singin'
Get to the office, I can hardly speak
'Cause it's the third late pass that I got this week

So to my first class, I run an' don't walk
All I hear is my sneakers an' the scratchin' of chalk
An' as I get to the room, I hear the teacher say
Mr. Young, I'm very happy that you could join us today

I try to sit down so I can take some notes
But I can't read what the kid next to me wrote
An' if that wasn't enough to make my mornin' complete
As I try to get up, I find this gum on my seat

An' with the seat stuck to me, I raise my hand
An' say, Excuse me but can I go to the bathroom, Ma'am?
The teacher got upset an' she screamed out, No
