Love, let me know, let me know
Love, let me know, let me know, let me know

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard for me to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn what you think you know

There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
