Ey shawty, shawty, shawty wadsyaname is,

(Verse 1)
Sad to say im only in town for the night you see,
I got like eight hours left before my flight occurrrr...
Ey yo im trying to stay respectful n polite ya digg,
now you can tell me go to hell if you like.
now I ain't one of them niggas that want to trip
get mad cuz you ain't intrested in yellin f**k you bitch
now dont get it twisted ya ima look when you pass,
but I ain't the one to pull on you arm or grab your ass,(whooo!)
you see its the swagger he wont allow me lookin thurst,
n I ain't attackin unless I get a signal first,
n I ain't the one thats gonna be payin to do the do...
before is over you gon say,
PPPSSHHHH! (I should pay you!)
please believe it...


(Chorus)
Ey shawty, shawty, shawty wadsyaname is,
wadsyaname is,
wadsyaname is
I said now shawty, shawty, shawty, whatcha yo sign,
ey whatcha yo sign,
ey whatcha yo sign,
