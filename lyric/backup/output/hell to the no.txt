Mama said get your ass out of bed
I said hell to the no
Said wash your grandma's nasty head
I said hell to the no

They tried to take away my tots
I said hell to the no
Yeah, 'cause I'm the one that calls the shots
And I say hell to the no

Try to make me change my weave
Well I got something up my sleeve
It's a whole lot of

Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I said
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hell to the no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
