When I first saw you baby
I wanted to die
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine
Started to cry then I'd dream
Wishin' my fantasy
Would soon become a reality
Cause every time I see you baby
All I do is sigh
Cause you're the most precious thing baby
That my dreamin' eyes has ever seen
So I continue to dream
Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine
