It was Friday night,
And I was feelin' AIGHT, (Yep)
Downtown Atlanta, big city, bright lights,
Mixin' Henny wit the Sprite,
While I'm drinkin' and drivin',
No police lights,
No police sirens,
I'm headed to the club, lookin' for a freak,
To spread a lil' love, to spread a couple cheeks,
Pull up to the spot, 26's like BEAMMM,
Eyes on me like "BITCH, DO YOU SEE EM'"?
Stroll to the front door headed to the VIP,
Bought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips,
Strokib' out the room and what do I SEE?,
A nice round butt and a pair of DOUBLE D's,
So, I crept up like SHAWTY WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?,
You killin' that dress and I love it with a passion,
Then she turned around and her face was AIGHT,
She had a gap tooth and a mean overbite,
But I was like HMMMMM...

(Refrain)
(T-Pain)
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' end up f**kin' YOUUUUUU,
Is that what you wanna DOOOO shawty?,
If I take one more drink,
I'm gon' end up f**kin' YOUUUUUU,
You TOOOOOO!!!

Woke up the next mornin' and all I can remember,
