Everyday is getting worse
Do the same things and it hurts
I don't know if I should cry
All I know is that I'm trying
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you (but you make it so hard to do)

What's the point of making plans
You break all the ones we have
I don't know where we went wrong
Cause we used to be so strong
I wanna believe in you
I wanna believe in you

So why can't you be
Be good to me
