want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

I'm slipping down a chain reaction
And here I go, here I go, here I go, go
And once again, I'm yours in fractions
It takes me down, pulls me down, pulls me down low

Honey, it's raining tonight
The storms always have an eye, have an eye
Tell me your cover tonight
