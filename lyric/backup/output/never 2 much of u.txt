There's never too much of you
The sun goes up the sun goes down
Think of you when you're not around
So I call you up on the phone
You tell me that you're there all alone
Now I know it sounds funny but I gotta know
If I come right over can I let my feeling show baby
'Cause you've been so good so good to me
You're the kind of lover I really do need
You're all I need

There's never too much of you
