I said, "I left my baby girl a message
Sayin' won't be coming home, I'd rather be alone"
She doesn't fully understand me
That I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she'll give me some time I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time to be alone

But when you love someone, you just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me, "How could you let this be?"
