The secret of love
I thought I understood
The way it's supposed to be
I never imagined you could

Blow my theory apart but now you're running
Away with my heart

I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze
What I'm doing here

Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself
In your kiss

Arrows through hearts
Drawn on a misty window
