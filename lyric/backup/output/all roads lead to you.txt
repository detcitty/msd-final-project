Blacktop? s burning, heat waves rise
Pick up my shove, l put my back to the grind
Got another job in Flagstaff and this one? s paid

I work the freeway, the pays all right
But I can? t get you off my mind
'Cause every stretch of highway ends the same

All roads lead to you
I thought I could forget but it? s now use
Your memory is there wherever I go, whatever I do
