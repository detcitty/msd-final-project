"No Mediocre"
(feat. Iggy Azalea)

All I fuck is bad bitches
I don't want no mediocre
Don't want no mediocre
I don't want no mediocre, no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don't want no mediocre
I won't hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stunting on the mediocre
All over the mediocre
You stunting on the mediocre
Seven bitches with me
And ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes
They so far from mediocre

Right hand in the air I solemnly swear
I never fuck a bitch if she don't do her hair
No more, you won't get no dick if there's a bush down there
Girl I should see nothing but pussy when I look down there
You come fuck with a nigga what better to do
He call and ask how you doing tell him better than you, yeah
I'm kicked back with four pieces like kit kat
Me fucking if you ain't a dime just forget that
Pretty face, fat ass, if she don't have
Have one of these, well I think I'll pass
I just handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it I took it back, you shoulda asked for a Benz
That's mediocre bitch
