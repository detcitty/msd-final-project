They call me Big L'y, Big Silly
Big Money, Big Billy
When I'm sliding in them all, can ya hear me?
I be sexing wit these bars so ya feel me

Let me grip it up for cuz in the back
Let me grip it, get a buzz in ya hat
I'm a tell ya how to cause an attack
Timbaland, Ladies Love on the track

Lovely get the ice, pop champagne
Don't forget I used to ride on the train
When I bump it right, call my name
Go crazy in the mall wit James

Dump that, not ill like me
Bring the women in to chill for free
Let me tell ya, girl, don't try me
You better have I.D. 'cause we be

When we be up in the club
We be posting the back
When we be in the club
Girl always come to the back

Everybody get a head sprung
Everybody get a head sprung
Everybody get a head sprung
Everybody get a head sprung

When we be up in the club
We be posting the back
When we be in the club
Girl always come to the back

Everybody get a head sprung
Everybody get a head sprung
