Looks like we're running out of time
Can't hide away
In nights no longer yours or mine

All things must change
It's so painful when nothing ever stays the same
But I must go on
While you run away from love, oh

Next time you'll know
Not to let my love go
When you feel afraid
And you can't love nobody
