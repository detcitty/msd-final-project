Oh yeah, I
Just wanna watch the girls, goin' by
It's like poetry in motion
Against a hot summer sky

I'm in love, yeah yeah
At least every minute or two
Until' the next time a girl walks by
I think I love her too

Oh I, I can't help myself
But I just lose my head
Every time you see 'em walkin' by

Summertime girls
