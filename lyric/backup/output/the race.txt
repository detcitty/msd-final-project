The World turning, the weed burning
Them haters talking, I keep earning
Know some will say that life's a bitch
Well I'ma flirtin and fuck that bitch for the money and Louie V purchases
Old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is
Niggas felxin' hard with no bars, they got weak servants
Keep verses, Mortal Kombat
Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin' then what you call that
Nothing but net, ain't back cause i never left.
I did everything right nigga better yet
Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us
Something like a contractor building from the ground up
Now just
Twist up this weed
Realize that you are in the presence of a G
Don't fuck up my paper meaning my cheese
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees
Fuck it, you know what I mean

I'm riding round, smoking good, music so loud
Kinda do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they don't on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own

I'm in a race, and taking the winners place
No foot on the brakes
