{I used to think about immature things
You know like, do you love me? Do you want me?
Are you gonna call me like you said you would?
Is this really your real phone number?
But you know I'm a man now, baby, a grown man
And I came a long way, ha-ha
'Cause those fears taught me one thing
Taught me to hold on to my love}

Sometimes
I just can't help thinkin' livin' without you, baby
See, sometime
I just can't live cryin' about you, baby

I'm not worried 'bout a doggone thing
I'll take anything you bring
Although I love the sunshine
I'll still accept the rain
'Cause when I'm in my lonely mood
And I just can't be with you
I tried everything to occupy my mind
But there was no substitute

Thinking all that life would be
When you're not around
I just could not find a way
I wouldn't even know up from down
But since I've had you in my life
All these can be found
So strong and true, baby
All comin' from you

You, I call your name, girl
(Whenever I am lonely, baby)
I call your name
(When I feel the need of love)
I think of you and it eases the pain
Take away the strain

'Cause I don't worry 'bout what my people say
