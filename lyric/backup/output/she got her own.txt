A dedication to the independent woman
To the one working hard for hers
That is just my way to let you know, I see you, baby
And I brought a friend along
To help me show my appreciation the right way
Ladies, Mr. Jamie Foxx, Mr. Foxx, ladies

I love her 'cause she got her own
She don't need mine, so she leave mine alone
There ain't nothin' that's more sexy
Than a girl that want, but don't need me

Young independent, yeah, she work hard
But you can tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow down 'cause she ain't got time
To be complaining, shawty gon' shine

She don't expect nothin' from no guy
She plays aggressive, but she's still shy
But you never know her softer side
By lookin' in her eyes

Knowing she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my world
Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin' for her throne

I love her 'cause she got her own
She got her own
I love her 'cause she got her own
She got her own
