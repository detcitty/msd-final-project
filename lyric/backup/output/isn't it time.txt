Falling in love was the last thing I had on my mind
Holding you is the warmth that I thought I could never find

(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Sitting here you're all alone)
Just trying to decide
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Whether to go on alone)
Or stay by your side
(Ooh ooh ooh)

(Then I stop myself because)
I know I could cry
I just can't find the answers
To the questions that keep going through my mind

Hey babe
Isn't it time

(Isn't it time you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)
Isn't it time

(Isn't it time you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)

I've seen visions of someone like you in my life
A love that's strong reaching out
Holding me through the darkest night

(Ooh ooh ooh)

(Sitting here you're all alone)
Just trying to decide
