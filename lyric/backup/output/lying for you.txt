When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just because I know I can
But I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from you

No, no turning back now
I want to be pushed aside, so let me go
No, no turning back now
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
No, no turning back now
Anywhere on my own because I can see
No, no turning back now
