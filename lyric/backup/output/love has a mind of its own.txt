Think about me and you
think of all the changes we've
been through
the laughter an the tears, the
years together
little did we both know
when we fell we gave up all control
though times get hard
we're strong enough to carry on

'Cause
Love has a mind of its own
it moves in its own circles
and it roams where it will roam
love has a mind of its own
