I believe in Jesus
His Father's only Son
I do believe He sees us
With the loaded gun

I believe in the magic
Of the Mujahideen
I still believe in Daniel Ortega
The sun in Omega, The Lord of the Rings
I believe in most everything
I believe, I believe

I have a friend in England
Who says I must escape
