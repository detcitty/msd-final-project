Who's watching?
Tell me who's watching
Who's watching me?
I'm just an average man, with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone, and
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?
When I come home at night
