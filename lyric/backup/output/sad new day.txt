Pain it's as dark as the night
Keeps you up-tight forever you fight
You try to break the bondage you experience
Deranged delirious mentally serious
Tell ME how do I break the chains on my brain
My mind my body my soul I need total control
Of my freedom and my liberty when will it be for all
All Berlin walls must fall
The physical torture and mental oppression
The anguish of depression life is a lesson
That you've got to study hard because the hard times
Are grippin' and whippin'
Quit slippin' don't be a slave just create
A positive state don't break just make and take
Be great don't be controlled just be strong never doubt
Your tomorrow and we'll hear you scream out

SAD NEW DAY GO AWAY -- SAD NEW DAY GO AWAY

When it rains it pours for pain is a force
