For Mac who reminds me of me seven years ago

In the middle of late last night I was sittin' on a curb
I didn't know what about, but I was feelin' quite disturbed
A street sweeper came whistlin' by, he was bouncin' every step
It seemed strange how good he felt, so I asked him while he swept

Chorus:
He said, "It's my job to be cleaning up this mess
