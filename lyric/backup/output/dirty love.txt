I see you walking by, you've got that faraway look in your eye
It was only yesterday, like a cheap suit you were all over me
I should know better by now my friend, just what I mean to you
You've been running in and out of my life so long
I don't want nothing to do with you

I don't need your dirty love, I don't want you touching me
I don't want your dirty love, it's enough, trying to live with the memory
