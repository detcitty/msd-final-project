Have you ever seen
A dime piece all alone at the bar, bar bar?
Straight out of a magazine
And you just want to let her know who you are, are are

So you say, let me buy you a drink
Or a little conversation
If that's what you want to do, do do
Then she said, love is about to end
Then you said, why don't you come to my crib?
Then she said, I can't leave my friends

Now you've officially been chopped and screwed
Screwed-screwed, chopped-chopped and screwed
You've officially been dance-dance screwed
And ewed-ewed, chopped screwed-screwed
You've officially been chopped and screwed

And-and screw, chop, screw-screwed
You've officially been screwed
