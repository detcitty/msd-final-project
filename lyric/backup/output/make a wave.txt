They say the beat of a butterflies wings,
Can set off a storm in the world away

What if that ride in the smallest of things
Can power the strongest hurricane?

What if it all begins inside?

We hold the key that turns the tide

Just a pebble in the water (ohh)
Can set the sea in motion (ohh)
A simple act of kindness (ohh)
Can stir the widest ocean
If we show a little love
