The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A.
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

Verse One: Kool G Rap

Champagne wishes of caviar dreams? a penis didn't cream?
With sales of fish scales from triple beams I gleam
Livin the live of rowdy packin fifty cali's
Rockin lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin beam-o's then parlay in Reno with two fly latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count mad for seen bad
We've seen a half a milli dashin out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Domateus
Fakers get used to shootin targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
that'll stray pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders, lookin straight crimy in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots ta come get through a whole army
The celo rollers money folders sippin bola holdin mad payola
Slangin a Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game we do our thing son

Chorus
