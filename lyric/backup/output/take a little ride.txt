Been goin' round and round all day
Bailin' some hay and stacking it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town
Shine the old truck up
Swing by the quick stop
Grab a little shiner bock
Then ease on out your way
To your place around 8 o'clock

Well I'm just ready to ride this chevy,
Ride this chevy down a little backroad
