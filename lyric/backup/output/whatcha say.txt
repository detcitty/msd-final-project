Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did she say?
Mmh whatcha say
Mmh that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmh whatcha say (Jason Derulo)
Mmh that it's all for the best?
Of course it is

I was so wrong for so long
Only tryin' to please myself (Myself)
Girl I was caught up in her lust
When I don't really want no one else

So no, I know I should of treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever
So let me in (let me in) give me another chance (another chance)
To really be your man

'Cause when the roof cave in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you

So tell me girl
Mmh whatcha say
Mmh that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmh whatcha say (Oh whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmh that it's all for the best?
