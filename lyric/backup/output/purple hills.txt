I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
Cool, calm, just like my mom

With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people
And 5 I hit
Ah shhh
I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick
And lost the foster kids
This room make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
To the women in the thongs wit thier asses out
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is crashing out
Get her on the couch while she passes out
Fuck that, someone help Denaun

Who's upstairs wrestlin with Elton John
Hey Von
You see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It's gonna be acid 'cos the X lax is gone
Yeah I took 'em all down with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone
It's probably numb
Dumb, dumb, and fulla...
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
You scary ass it was false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
So stop acting stupid
You so high
That you might wake up with a guy
