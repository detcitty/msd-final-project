When there's something I can't have, 
I only want it more.
You know I sure found out the hard way
That it's true.
'Cause there's a storm inside of me
From wantin' you.
How I wish that I'd found you in time, 
'Cause now you're his and can't be mine.

But you can start a fire raging
Just by touching me.
Even though I know
We're not supposed to touch.
