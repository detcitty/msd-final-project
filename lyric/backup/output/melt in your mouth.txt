This one goes out
To all the suckers out there
Who thought I was soft
When I dropped Knockin' Boots
For the ladies

But I'm-a come correct this time
And do something a little bit different

Who you gonna cook this to, man
Mmm, the ladies

Melt in your mouth
Not in your hand
The C-A to the Ndy
The m-a-n

I'm like no other man
Cause you know
No other man can
Be an undercover lover
And a soul brother man

On the other hand
Introduce me to your mother and
I wouldn't be surprised if
She's my number one fan

Here I stand
A full six feet three
At the perfect matched heights
To be when you meet me

Under a palm tree
In the middle of the beach
Bring a towel or a suit
Like the boots with sand on my feet

After we eat
What we brought on the pier
I hear your earrings jingle
Like a chandelier

As you premiere
What you hear is not a simile
Bit it's meant to be the poetry 

There'll never be another Candyman
Because I melt in your mouth
Not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Not in your hand
