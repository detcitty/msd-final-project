Five names that I can
Hardly stand to hear
Including yours and mine
And one more chimp who isn't here

I can see the ladies talking
How the times are getting hard
And that fearsome excavation
On Magnolia Boulevard

Yes, I'm going insane
And I'm laughing at the frozen rain
And I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home
