Can I get your hand to write on?
Just a piece of lead to bite on
What am I to fly my kite on?
Do you want to flash your light on?
Take a look its on display for you
Coming down no not today

Did you meet your fortune teller?
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's always stellar
What a way to finally smell her
Pick it up it's not to strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on
