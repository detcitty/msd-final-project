Mmm, baby
When my way was dark and weary
Into my life, you came
You brought me the kind of loving, baby
That words could never, never explain

Oh, your sweet conversation
I began to see the light
We got the kind of relation
That's what makes everything all right

And that's what keeps me hanging on
Oh, baby, without your loving, I can't go on
Cause it keeps me hanging on
