Maybe it's the way she walked (Wow!)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and passed the guards (Wow!)
Just like she already owned it

I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams!"

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes...
