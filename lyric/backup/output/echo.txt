Echo
You did it to yourself
Now you're all by yourself
Acting like you hate me
I left because you made me

You played me to the left
Now there's nobody left
To hear your complaining
I'm gone and all you hearing is your own

Echo, e-e-echo
And I'm gone and you're all alone
Can't you hear the
Echo, e-e-echo?
No one to hear you
There's nobody near you

It started off great but who was to know
That love that is lost, cannot be let go?
You say it's my fault, okay, then I'll go
It's better to know
Now there's nobody to argue with

'Cause I'm not home
Don't care who you're with
Don't call my phone

Or did you forget
You know you're wrong?
