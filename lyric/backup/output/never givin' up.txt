I've been afraid that I had missed the chance of a lifetime
And by the way I've tumbled with romance, girl
And I don't cry but now I'm searching every star
(I go on)

Searching near and far
(Every dawn)
'Til I find our one spirit flying high
Flying high

I'll never give it up, never gonna give it up, even when this life is over
Never give it up, never gonna give it up, even when this life is over
Never give it up, never gonna give it up, even when this life is over
