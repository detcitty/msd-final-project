It goin' down right here
Hold that nigga back You can, you can get crunk in the club
Roll, roll wit your hood, get stomped in the club
Or you could, you could get buck in the club
Get fucked up in the club, nigga, we don't give a fuck

But you don't, you don't want no problem, problem
But you don't, you don't want no problem, problem
But you don't want no problem with me
BME, we be filthy deep

You don't wanna be dead in the streets
Mouth, mouth full of blood an' soul full of heat
Why you, why you tryna act hard as hell?
Know, know damn well, you don't wanna feel the shell

Nigga, I've been down by the law
Gun to my head, pressed dead to the wall
I got big balls an' bullets like baseballs
Split ya dome, put you straight, knock out all y'all
