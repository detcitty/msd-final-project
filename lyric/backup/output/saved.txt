Everytime they see me ballin'
All my old bitches callin'
Pull up in exotic, I see a little bitch jockin'

Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Tryna get saved, she wanna get saved, I ain't gonna save her
Yeah!

No I won't save her
Dolla $ign a fuckboi he won't date her
About my paper, real big shit man everything Taylor
Vans on like a skater
We eatin' over here, man, everything catered
She know I'm a player
