You da one that I dream about all day
You da one that I think about always
You are the one, so I make sure I'll behave
My love is your love, your love is my love...

Baby, I love you I need you here with me all the time...
Baby, we meant to be
You got me smiling all the time...

Cause you know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back when I go runnin', runnin'
Tryna get away from loving ya
You know how to love me hard
I won't lie, I'm falling hard
Yep, I'm falling for ya but there's nothin' wrong with that

You da one that I dream about all day...
You da one that I think about always...
You are the one, so I make sure I'll behave...
My love is your love, your love is my love...
