I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still prob'ly working
At a nine-to-five pace

I wonder how bad that tastes
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell

Hope it gives you hell
Now where's your picket fence, love
And where's that shiny car
And did it ever get you far
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard

Do you know where you are
And truth be told, I miss you (Miss you)
