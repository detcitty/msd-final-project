Yo what up you know
What's up dawg
Just kicking this on the thing for the basketball 
White men
White men
White men
Yeah yeah
White men
To the beat ya'll
White men
To the beat ya'll
White men

Sometimes you have to do
What you gotta do
To even out the score
Don't ever fake your game
It's not a sure thing
Hold on and get it through

Bet your bottom dollar
That you can make them holler
Don't you know that white men can't jump
And if you say it louder
Than you might make me prouder
Don't you know that white men can't jump
White men can't jump
