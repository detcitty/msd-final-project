You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo

You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they looking you let me hide
Defend my honour, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But looking back it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lying, know when I'm crying
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I trying, no you ain't lying
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make hoarse from yelling at you
At gettin' at you, pickin' up dishes and throwing them at you

Why are you speaking when no-one asks you

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
