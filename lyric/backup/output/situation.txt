Blue eyed, dressed for every situation
Moving through the doorway of a nation
Pick me up and shake the doubt
Baby, I can't do without

(Move out) don't mess around
(Move out) you bring me down
(Move out) how you get about it
Don't make a sound, just move out

I remember only for an hour
Move right through me, can you feel the power?
I don't know what's going on
It scares me, but it won't be long

(Move out) don't mess around
(Move out) you bring me down
(Move out) how you get about it
