She's a very kinky girl,
The kind you don't take home to mother;
She will never let your spirits down,
Once you get her off the street.

She likes the boys in the band,
She says that I'm her all time fav'rite;
When I make my move to her room,
It's the right time; she's never hard to please.

That girl is pretty wild now;
The girl's a super freak;
The kind of girl you read about
