Yeah, used to treat my mattress like the ATM yeah
Bond number 9 that's my favorite scent, yeah
Can't forget the kush I'm talking OG, oh yeah
Rest in peace to pop, he was an OG
Oh yeah, 285 I had that pack on me
Uh, I can not forget I had that strap on me
Yeah, rest in peace to my nigga Doe
All he ever want to do is ball
That was the easy part
We playing that Weezy hard
We sit in the kitchen late
We tryna to make an escape
Trying to make me a mil
So I'mma keep me a plate
I told 'em shawty can leave
So I'mma keep me a rake
So I'mma keep me a Wraith
My jewelry look like a lake
Today I'm in the Maybach
And that car came with some drapes
You know I look like a safe

I look you right in your face
Sing to your bitch like I'm Drake, yeah
