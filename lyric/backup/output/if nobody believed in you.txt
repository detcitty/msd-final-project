I watched him take the two strike call
He hadn't tried to swing at all
I guess he had all he could take
He walked away for goodness sake
His father's voice was loud and mean
"You won't amount to anything".

That little boy quit trying
He just walked away
There were tear drops on his face
Tell me how would you feel
