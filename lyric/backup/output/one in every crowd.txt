Golden Tee, shuffleboard, pinball, he's got the score
that everybody around here's tryin to beat,
he's a six pack up when he walks in,
tells the band crank it up to 10,
then he's up dancin on his seat,
well he's a big mouth, yellin' hey play some free bird,
says give me three steps and nobody gets hurt,
then he takes off his shirt


Chorus:
There's one in every crowd,
brings the party in us out,
good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound,
