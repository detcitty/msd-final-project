We all sip the Henny for the day baby
Bodmon, we no stray baby
Oops I done fell for your way baby
I know girl but, everyone falls...

And I know from the first time, the first time
I seen your love, you got me baby
Even though girl I know that I will fall for you
You got to know that everyone falls
Oops I done fell so deep baby
Oops I want you for me baby
Oops I want you for me baby
Oops I done fell so deep cause...

Everyone falls in love sometimes
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
If you let me love you, love you, love you for long time baby
If you let me touch you, and if you let me love you 'til the morning, oh

Mmm, ah, mmm, ah, mmm, if you let me love you
