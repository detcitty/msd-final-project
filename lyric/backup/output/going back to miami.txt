Going back to Miami (Going back to Miami)
Going back to my girl (Going back to my girl)
I said I'm going back to Miami (Going back to Miami)
Going back to my girl (Going back to my girl)


I've got to get back to my baby
And take her in my arms again
I've got to get back to my baby
I ain't seen her since I don't know when
