I'm more than just an option
Hey, hey, hey
Refused to be forgotten
Hey, hey, hey
I took a chance with my heart
Hey, hey, hey
And I feel it taking over

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothing's gonna tear us apart
