Uh, uh, uh, what?
Yeah, I know it's not too ghetto
I know it's not too ghetto
I said, I know it's not too ghetto

You better check yourself, respect yourself
You better go for self 'cause I flow for self
(You gets no love from me)

I’ll tell you why there's no love
Simply you’re not cool enough
For what we had between us
Don’t you know you lost my trust

People ask me where you been
And I tell them, we're just friends
'Cause it's obvious, it's never gonna work for us
Oh no, oh no, no

Played with my emotions
You’ll gets no devotion, you gets no love
You can get no love from me
You can even be my friend

And you’d gets no love again
Whatever you do it
It will come back and use it
You gets no love
