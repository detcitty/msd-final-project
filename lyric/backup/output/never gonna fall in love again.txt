No use pretending things can still be right
There's really nothing more to say
I'll get along without your kiss goodnight
Just close the door and walk away

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
'Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you

No, I never want to feel the pain
