Baby does he do it for ya
When he's finished, does he step back and adore ya

I just gotta know cause your time is money
And I won't let him waste it

Ooh no nooo
Baby just go with it
Cause when your with me I can't explain it
It's just different
We can take it slow
Or act like your my girl let's skip the physics
