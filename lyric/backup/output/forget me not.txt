You leave the light on at your door
You cross your heart
Across the bedroom floor
And through the window
To your world
You can feel me there
And you know I'm waiting
You taste the words
Of my forbidden kiss
Our eyes connect
And we both know what this is
I will be your keeper
You possess the key
Forget me not
Forget me not
Cause you belong to me
I will be your shadow
When you walk away
Forget me not
Forget me not
I will follow you
Until your dying day
Oh yeah
Oh
A thousand lifetimes long ago
