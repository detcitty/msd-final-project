I thought I spoke to you last evening
I woke up cryin' in my sleep
I dreamed that we were still together
But now I'm back out on the street

I've been runnin' so hard
Tryin' to find the place
Where my baby might be stayin'
I've just gotta see her face

I know there's lots of lonely people
Cryin' all around the world
And this is just another story
About a boy who lost his girl
