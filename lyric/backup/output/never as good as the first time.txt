Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right

Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it
Then it flows right to you

So we rely on the past
Special moments that last
We're as tender as we dare to remember

Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss?
The thrill of the first kiss
