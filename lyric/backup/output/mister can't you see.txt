I can hear the rivers flowing
And I can see the winds blowing
Since the endless marching of the time

And if you don't know what I'm feeling
Take a look 'cause I'm revealing
Everything that's now
Running through my mind

I'm telling you the time is coming
You're gonna have to start
Your poor legs running
