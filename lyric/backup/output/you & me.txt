How would you feel
If I asked you to spend your whole life with me
Baby believe in me
'Cause as strong as I'm for you from someone else would never be

Yeah, it's real, it's real, it's real
I've never felt this way before
So say you'll be mine
Together we will open every door

You and me
Together forever
You and me
Just us two

You and me
Belong together
Sharing everything that we do
