The selfish, they're all standing in line
Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time
Me, I figure as each breath goes by

I only own my mind
...
The north is to south what the clock is to time

There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that I'll die
The in-between is mine
