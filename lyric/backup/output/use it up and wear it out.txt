Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long, do it all night
Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long, do it all night
Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long, do it all night
Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long

Everybody, all you people gather `round
And let your body music, move it up and move it down

We`re gonna use it up, gonna wear it out
Ain`t nothing left in this whole world I care about
I said one two three shake your body down (shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down to me (shake it on down to me)
One two three shake your body down (shake it on down to me)
One two three ah shake

Everybody, body looking good tonight
