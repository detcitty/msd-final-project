Living in the city
I've been abused, he has
Jobs I keep the people I meet
They don't do more than make me amused

Everywhere I turn now
Just more bad news
So don't look now and don't ask how
We're gonna find me a way to the animal zoo?

Oh no something went wrong
Well you're much too fat and a little too long
