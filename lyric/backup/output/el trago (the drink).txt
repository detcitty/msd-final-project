Gimme a token, I wanna get open
Pour me a Coke and rum and then some
I ain't joking, I need to get open
So I'm-a need more than just one

I've just begun
I feel the buzz and rush, man
And I got the touch like

I'm super, never blooper
Blunder, rough like thunder
Got the hunger, I feel the hunger
All I wants is get up under

And you surrender, love me tender
Won't ever leave me drunk and lonely
So take my keys and drop me home
And work me to the bom bom bom

Hey, yo, D (what up, dude)
Let me get open on this groove
'Cause I be the lifted one
Gifted one with the gifted tongue
Enlisted on this
