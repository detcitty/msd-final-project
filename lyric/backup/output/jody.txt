Everybody wants Jody...
Everybody wants Jody...
Everybody wants you, girl...

Everybody wants you, baby.

Diamonds on the left,
Stars on the right.
Be my girl from early in the night.

She don't need protection,
She don't have to fight.
She just?
? says she might.

You can't explain it.
Made you weak,
Make your body wreak, ha!
