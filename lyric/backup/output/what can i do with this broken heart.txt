The night is starting here we go
I check out everything
This is our time to lose control
What do you want from me
You line them up we'll put them down
This is so frustrating
To watch you sleazing all around
Yet you keep on smiling
What can I do to make you see
You're guilty
What can I do to make you feel
You're wanted
What can I do to make you see
