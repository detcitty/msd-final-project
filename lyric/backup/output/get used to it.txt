I did not know what you were about
Something called "love"
Made me want to find out
Did not think you could ever care
But I'm outta control
'Cause you're takin' me there
I couldn't believe our love would last
It's comin' on strong, girl
Comin' on so much faster

Get used to it
'Cause I'll be around
