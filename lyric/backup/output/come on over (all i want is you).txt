Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey boy don't you know
I got something going on
I've got an invitation
Don't you keep me waiting all night long

I know, you know, so baby don't
Pretend you won't, keep me guessing if you
You will or you won't
Don't wanna play that game with you baby
Said listen to me

All I want is you, come over here baby
All I want is you, you know you make me go crazy
All I want is you, now baby don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you
