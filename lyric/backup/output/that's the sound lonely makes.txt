Mmm, that's the sound
That lonely makes
Oh, that's the sound
My heart can't take

Streets deserted
Only emptiness and me
Walk side by side
Down the road to destiny

Time for dreaming
(Time for dreaming)
'Cause reality makes me cry
I'm left with memories
(Left with memories)
Of a love saying goodbye

Oh, clocks keep a-ticking
But time will stop for me
I've lost the beat of life
With the start of misery

Oh, that's the sound, yeah
That lonely makes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, that's the sound
(That's the sound, yeah)
My heart can't take, mmm
