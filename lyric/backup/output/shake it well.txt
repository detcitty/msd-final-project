My name is Squirrel
Best shaker in the world
Shake it on down
(Shake, shake, shake it, baby)
Shake it down to the ground
(Baby, baby, shake it down)

Oh, yeah, yeah... 

You've got problems
I've got problems
I can tell, ooh, ooh

Here's my best key
Such a good therapy
It's called shake it well
Well, well, well

It's the best sensation
For your frustrations
And it never fails, no

Move your body to the music
And shake it well, oh, girl

Hey, hey
Shake it right on time
Do it to the music
Ooh, you got it on
Let's see you use it

Let your hair hang down
Oh, you party pooper
Forget about yourself
Ooh, let the music groove

Not an inspection
Just a bad reaction
Baby, ain't no thrill
Ain't no thrill to me

There could never be
