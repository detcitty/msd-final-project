Um, mmm, is it something that I'm missin'?
Um, mmm, is it something that you got?
Um, mmm, not to go to a sleep about a dream, yeah, baby

What's stopping you from loving me?
When I can give you all you need
What's stopping you from loving me?
You must be sleepin', still out there creepin'

Everything you do, oh, you know I like
Girl, it ain't cool saying okay and then stay inside
Girl, I'll be patient, I'll even change my ways
Looking for your love is like walking through a stage

What's stopping you from loving me?
When I can give you all you need
