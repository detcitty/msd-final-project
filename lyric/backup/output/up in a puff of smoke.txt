Going up, going up
Going up, up, up
Going up, going up
Going up, up, up
Going up, going up
Going up, up, up
Going up, going up, oh!

Like a bubble
Headed for trouble
Wind is blowing
In the wrong direction
I was headed into danger
Too much in love to see

I pledged my trust in him
Believed in everything
Just had me on a string
And then he let me blow away
