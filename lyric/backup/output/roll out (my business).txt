Roll out! I got my twin glock .40's, cocked back

Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that
Twin glock .40's, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that
Now where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?
Where'd you get that matchin Benz with them windows tinted?

Who dem girls you be with when you be ridin through?
Man I ain't got nothin to prove, I paid my dues
Breakin the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin a CRUISE!
Tell me who's your weed man, and how do you smoke so good?
You'se a superstar boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that BAG, what you got in that BAG?
A couple a cans of whoop ass, you did a good-ass job
of just eyein me, spyin me
I got my twin glock .40's, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that

We rollin on twenties, with the top back
