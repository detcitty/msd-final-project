Now, I don't have to question
Where you were last night
'Cause I already know what you will say
I already know you'll lie

But I can't be mad at ya
'Cause there's something that you don't know
That when you're gone I do my own thing
And I catch a bone while you're dogging me

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
When you're feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not 'cause I'm out getting mine

When you're out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when you're out making love, don't think I'm not
