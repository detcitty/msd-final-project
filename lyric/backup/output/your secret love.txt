A kiss in the dark a certain time I can call you
A letter of love but no name did you sign
Pretending to all that we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be
I didn't know that you wanted me for your, to be

Your secret love, why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves never last as long
Your secret love will never be your true love
I can't be no secret baby it's breakin' my heart
