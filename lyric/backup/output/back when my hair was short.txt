Back when my hair was short
I was a white socked sport
Wore pointed shoes and pegged pants
Drank till my eyes were red
Hid Playboy neath my bed
Slicked my d.a. for the dance

Back when my hair was short
I met some friends in court
For stealing hubcaps from cars
Chain smoking under the stars
Played all night pinball in bars
