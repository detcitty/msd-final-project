Hey listen, treasure
You know I'm waiting for you
I want some pleasure
I love those things that you do

Do you know what you want
Oh yes I do
Do you know how to get it
You know that it's true

I know what I want
And I know how to get it
So come on baby
Let's do it again

I feel your motion of love
I feel the motion of love
I feel the motion of love
