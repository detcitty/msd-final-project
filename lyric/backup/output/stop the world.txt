All the world's a masquerade
made up of fools and philosophers
Were it to rain on our charade
All washes away, except for our true colors

If any people bothered looking for truth, please
(Stop the world from spinning 'round)
instead we choose to follow footsteps of fools, please
(Stop the world from spinning 'round)

If nothing's new under the sun for me and you
Won't somebody please...

Stop the world
Stop the world
I wanna get off
Stop the world
Stop the world
