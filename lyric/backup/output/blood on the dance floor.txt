She got your number
She know your game
She put you under
It's so insane
Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill
Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world
I got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Right on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love
And true romance
And now she's out to get me
