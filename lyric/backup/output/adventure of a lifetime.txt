Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends every day
That's what she told me

Turn your magic on,
To me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure under this weight
We are diamonds

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
