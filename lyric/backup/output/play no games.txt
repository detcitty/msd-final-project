OK, I won't deny it
Half the time you send a text, yep, you know I'm not replying
Just to let you know, I'm not one of them niggas you be dodging
I'm the one that you dodge with
I'm the one that you gon' take that dress you saving out the closet
I'm the one you need alone
I'm the one that when you round your friends, that you gotta put on speakerphone
Just so you can let them know what we be on, like he the one
Yeah yeah, I know I'm young but you respect me like a father figure
Young mobbish nigga, probably make you farther figures
Sean Don Perrier out in Paris with a pair of Ye's going
Well, I would tell you but I gotta paraphrase
And even when you tripping, we tripping, I pay for ya
Gourmet for ya, chauffeur arranged for ya
I'll take that flight alone earlier in the day for ya
Just to beat you there and prepare, let you know I'm waiting for ya
Finally famous

I ain't like them other niggas
And I ain't bout to play no games with you
