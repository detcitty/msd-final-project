Oh, oh, oh, yeah

You can hardly wait to tell all your friends
How his kisses taste sweet like wine
And how he always makes your heart skip a beat
Everytime he walks by

And if you're feeling down
He'll pick you up
He'll hold you close when you're making love
He's everything you been dreaming of, oh baby

I wish you'd look at me that way

Your beautiful eyes looking deep into mine
Telling me more than any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive
Baby, to you all I am is the invisible man
Oh, you don't see me baby
You probaby spend hours on the phone

Talking 'bout nothing at all
It doesn't matter what the conversation
Just as long as he calls
