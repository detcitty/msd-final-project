"Better With The Lights Off"
(feat. Chris Brown)

You're a dime, so beautiful
Top of the line, so unusual
Words can't define,
You're running through my mind all day (day)
I'm so happy you're mine, so beautiful
Top of the line, so unusual
Now I think it's time, hey shawty
I hope you don't take this the wrong way

Girl you look better with the lights off,
Better with the lights off ooh
Girl you look better with the lights off,
Better with the lights off ooh
Better with the lights off

Hey miss America, what you look so sad for?
Sweetheart you only live one time
So put your fantasies on fast forward
Like gon' speed me up,
Got a deadline, cause you need me done
