I fell in love in a 7/11 parking lot
Sat on the curb drinking slurpees we mixed with alcohol
We talked about all our dreams and how we would show 'em all (whoa oh oh oh)

I told him I got a plan and I'm gonna dominate
And I don't need any man to be getting in my way
But if you talk with your hands then we can negotiate (whoa oh oh oh)

I'll just keep moving my body (yeah, yeah)
I'm always ready to party (yeah, yeah)
No I don't listen to mommy (yeah, yeah)
And I'll never say that I'm sorry

I am an American girl
