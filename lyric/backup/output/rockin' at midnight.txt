Have you heard the news
There's good rocking at midnight
I'm gonna hold my baby with all my might
What a wonderful time we had that night
Hey, hey, there's good rocking at midnight
Have you heard the news
There's good rocking at midnight
I'm gonna hold my baby with all my might
What a wonderful time we had that night
Hey hey, there's good rocking at midnight
Now sweet Georgia Brown and sweet Lorraine
They got caught on Caledonia's land
Sioux City Sue then told it all
Those girls got drunk and they had a ball
Crying hey hey, good rocking at midnight
Well, two times
