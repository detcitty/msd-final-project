Bryan Adams
Waking Up the Neighbours
There Will Never Be Another Tonight
Put on your best dress darling
Can't you see the time is right
There will never be another tonight

If you got your motor runnin'
Then I got my engines on
Say the word and darlin' we'll be gone
Outside the world is waitin'
But we won't lose control
So come on now - let the good times roll
