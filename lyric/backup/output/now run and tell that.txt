Every big city man, 
Run around town, just... 
Even tellin' how he loves, 
A man'll put him down, yes... 

How he gets what he wants, 
Then he'll blow your mind, 
Aww, but baby, you met your match this time, yeah yeah.

Hey hey, Mr. Playboy, 
Hey Romeo, 
It broke your heart, 
If I let you go.

You been tellin' everybody where it's at.
Now run and tell that.
(Run on)
That's what you're gonna do.
