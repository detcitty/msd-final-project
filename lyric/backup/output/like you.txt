Yo!
It's your boy!
Daddy Yankee!
All my Latinos stand up!
Marcando la historia
Caminen comigo en esta!
Holla back. You know how we do man!

Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)
Cause you're the only one for me (All I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel (All I want is a girl like you)

Straight up, you's a bad ass, baby you hot
In the hood you feel the tension when you walk down the block
That's the reason you mujers got me, believe it or not
Me and you can run the world like Biggie and Pac
Cause you my main homie, my main shorty
Cock back hammers and bang homie, protecting our gauge slowly
