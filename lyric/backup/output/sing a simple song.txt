Sing a simple song! 

Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
I'm talking, talking, talking, talking, talking in my sleep
I'm walking, walking, walking, walking, walking in the street
Times are passing
I grow older
Things are happenin' fast
All I have to hold on to is a simple song at night

Let me hear you say
Ah, ya ya ya ya (AH)
Let me hear you say
Ah, ya ya ya ya (AH)
