All I wanna do is stay right here on the floor
Get lost in the night 'n' dance like there's no tomorrow
Don't care about the sunrise
Somebody please just hit the lights
All I wanna do is dance like there's no tomorrow

Today just wasn't my day
Everyone's getting me so fed up
I gotta find a way
I know what can make me feel better
Stepping out in my best
Looking hotter than ever
Wherever the party is
