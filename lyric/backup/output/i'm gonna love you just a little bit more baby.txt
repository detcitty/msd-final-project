It feels so good
You lying here next to me
Oh, what a groove
You have no idea, how it feels
My hands just wonâ€™t keep still
I love you, baby
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you
I just wanna hold you
Runmy fingers through your hair
Ooh
Outta sight
Uh-huh, right there, you like it like that
Closer
Come here, closer, close
