She bathes me in sweetness
I cannot reveal
For sharing dreams
I need my woman

This humble expression
Meagerly dressed
My eyes so mean
It has no meaning

But jealous night and
All her secret chords
I must be deaf on the telephone
I need my love to translate

I play the piano
No more running honey
This time to the sky
I'll sing if clouds don't hear me

To the sun I'll cry
And even if I'm blinded
I'll try moon gazer
Because with you I'm stronger
I'm stronger, I'm stronger

Arc of a diver
Effortlessly
My mind in sky
And when I wake up
