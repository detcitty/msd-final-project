I was twenty and she was eighteen
we were just about as wild as we were green
in the ways of the world
she'd pick me up in that red ragtop
we were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
on a summer night
running all the red lights
we'd park way out in a clearing in a grove
and the night was as hot as a coal-burning stove
we were cooking wiht gas
knew it had to last
