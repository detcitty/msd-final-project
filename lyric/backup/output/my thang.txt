Fellas, yeah
A brand new funk
Tell us about it
Brand new funk

If you wanna get down with a bird
This is the way you do it
Walk up and rap to her
Put your hand on the lower level
Come on now, you know

And this is what you rap to her
I mean, come on like you should
Come on with your, come on

Gimme, gimme your thing
Gimme, gimme my thing
Gimme, gimme my thing
Feels so good, let's get it on
Gimme

Make it stone to the bone
