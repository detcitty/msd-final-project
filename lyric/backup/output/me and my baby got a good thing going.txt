Hey, yeah, I want all you
Brothers and sisters to stand up
I want everybody to stand up
And be counted tonight

Brothers and sisters if you
Know you got your thing together
I want you stand on up

Now I got something to tell you
I told you how to think about it
And now I wanna tell how
To get your thing together

So come on and get a groove going
Stand up and clap your hands, y'all
Hit me now, hey
