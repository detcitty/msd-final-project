Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo

And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
Said to my friend, baby, nothin' else mattered

He was no more than a baby then
Well he seemed broken hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him, all alone
On the edge of... seventeen

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
