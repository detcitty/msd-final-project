Child isn't born with a prejudiced mind
He only learns what he sees
Or what he's taught to do

Think about your children, mother
Help all mankind
Don't let the weight of hate
Weigh the world down

Here we are in this world together
We were meant to live with each other
Tell the child the truth, it's your own son
