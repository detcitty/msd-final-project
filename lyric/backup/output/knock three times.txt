Hey, girl, whatcha doin' down there?
Dancin' alone every night
While I live right above you

I can hear your music playing
I can feel your body swaying
One floor below me
You don't even know me
I love you

Oh, my darling
Knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Mmm, hmm, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no
