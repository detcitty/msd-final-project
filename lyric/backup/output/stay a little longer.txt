Something like a strong wind is coming over
Has got a hold of me, yeah
Thinking and doing things I shouldn't be
No, I shouldn't be

One more call
It's one more "whatcha doin right now?"
It's one more trip to my side of town and you walk right in
One more here we go again

One more drink leads to another
You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
