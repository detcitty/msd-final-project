Won't you please?
Slow it down
I'm tryna talk to you, darling
Tryna walk with you, darling
Do you hear me?
And no-no-no-no-nobody can stop it
The love you got from me
And every time, I look out at my seat today
They chase, they flash they flash, yes

Tell me how you feel right now
'Cause all I wanna do is keep it real right now
I'm tryna beat it up
Beat Pills right now
Athletic in the sheets
I got skills right now
Red braids, with some red baby hair
Ballin' in that club, Ace of Spades, yeah
Pop that bitch and spray it like 'Raid'
Yellow diamonds on you like a glass of lemonade
QB, I'll throw it
Teeth white, Newports
I want knees, right choice
80 thousand dollar Birkin bag in the Porsche
