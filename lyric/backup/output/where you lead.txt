Wantingyou the way I do
I only want to be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
'cause darling
To me that's what you're worth
Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere, that you tell me to
If you need, need meto bewith you
I will follow whereyou lead
If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely and oh so cold
