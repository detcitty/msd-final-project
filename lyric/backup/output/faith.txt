Well, I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you

Oh, but I gotta think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too

Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well, it takes a strong man, baby
