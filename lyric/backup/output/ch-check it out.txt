All you Trekkies and TV addicts
Don't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static
All you Klingons in the fuckin' house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud

Blowin' doors off hinges
I'll grab you with the pinchers
And no, I didn't retire, I'll snatch you up
With the needle nose pliers

Like mutual Omaha
Got the ill boat, you've never seen before
Gliding in the glades and like Lorne Greene
You know I get paid

Like caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like Darren or Hazel
I'm a mother fucking nick at night
With classics rerunning that you know all right

Now remain calm, no alarm
'Cause my farm ain't fat, so what's up with that
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check

So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that y'all and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock

Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about?
