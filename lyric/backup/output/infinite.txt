Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying, cuz they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, a zany act, a maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming rills of roaches, when sprayed in this infections
Twistin necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass in the track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring, gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...

I'm Infinite
