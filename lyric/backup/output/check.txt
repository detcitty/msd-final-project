I can see that bullshit from a mile away
You can stack my money about a mile away
I got three white bitches like it's powder day
Mink coat with the rolls like a Shar Pei
And all my bitches sexy, call them Barbies
She lookin' back like I'm flexin', baby no way
And lately I've been on that D'usse
I got me a check, I got a check
Y'all, I done got me a check, I got a check
Y'all, I done got me a check, I got a check

Y'all, I done got me a check, I got a check
Money on my mind, I got money on my brain
Money in my pants, I got money, I call change
20, 50, 100, 5, all the millions made
Big hundred dollar, screamin' free Gucci Mane
If I need some racks I'mma flip me some packs
I talk like I want and she don't say nothin' back

If cops pull up I put that crack in my crack
