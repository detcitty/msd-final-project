What it is hoe, ah what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut

Well, give me your number and I'll call
And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my balls
While I'm beatin' and tearin' down your walls

This your boy Mr. Funkadelic, what's the business baby
I've been eying you all day in the mall miss lady
You looking good, I think I seen your ass in the hood
With your friends dressed up, trying to front if you could

But anyway, gone and drop a number or something
So I can call you later on, on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, 'cause tonight we cutting, gut busting

I'm digging in your walls something vicious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut something serious
You delirious, or might I say you taste so delicious
With your pretty brown skin, like Almond Joys and Kisses

And you ah certified head doctor
Number one staller that takes dick in the ass and won't holler
Bend you over and I'll follow you straight to the room
Where it goes down lovely in the Legion of Doom
