She's a good girl, she's daddy's favorite
He's saved for Harvard, he knows she'll make it
She's good at school, she's never truant
She can speak French, and I think she's fluent

'Cause every night she studies hard in her room
At least that's what her parents assume
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend
Here's what she told me the time that I caught 'em

She said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught

Whoa
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
Whoa
