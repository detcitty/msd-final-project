Heyy, heyy, heyyy!
Heyy, heyy, heyyy!
Heyy, heyy, heyyy!

(Chorus)
I don't know what I would do
Do without you
In my life boy
I don't know if I could live
Live without you
You bring me joy

(Vs.1)
You know if the time is right
I don't wanna fuss n fight
I just wanna let you know
I'm feeling good tonight
I want you to take my hand
