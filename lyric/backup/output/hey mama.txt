Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the floor and move your booty mama

We the blast masters blastin' up the jamma
(REEEEEEEWIIIIIIND)
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party

the way your body look really make me really feel naughty
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party

the way your body look really make me really feel naughty

I got a naughty naughty style and a naughty naughty crew
But everything I do, I do just for you
I'm a little bit of old, and a bigger bit of Nu
The true niggers know that the peas come thru
We never cease (NOO), we never die no we never decease (NOO)
We multiply like we mathamatice

Then we drop bombs like we in the middle east
(The bomb bombas, the base move dramas)

Naw y'all knaw, who we are
y'all knaw, we the stars
Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
