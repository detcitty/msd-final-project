Suzi Quatro -:- She's in love with you

She's in love with you
That's all she wants to do
She'll never let you down, she'll never fool around
'Coz she's in love with you

So if you see her all alone one night walk up to her discreetly, ask her why
And if she replies with words that don't make sense it may be just because she's shy
Don't take advantage of her lack of understanding just because you think you could
Treat her right, treat her good take her home and make her feel the way she should

'Coz she's in love with you
