Hey, yo, to all the killers
And the hundred dollar billers
For real, niggas who ain't got no feelings
Check it out now

I got you stuck off the realness
We be the infamous, you heard of us
Official Queens murderers
The Mobb comes equipped with warfare

Beware of my crime family
Who got 'nuff shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face
Stab your brain with your nosebone

You're all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for theirself in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin'
Like they supposed to
They come around but they never come close to

I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they're whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'

Your simple words just don't move me, you're minor, we're major
You all up in the game and don't deserve to be a playa
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate

I'm only nineteen but my mind is older
And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold
