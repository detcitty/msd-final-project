I see them marching off to war
They're looking so heroic
I'm told they won't be gone for long
But that's a lie and they know it

Ten thousand gone they won't return
Never to be seen again
Strategic games is all we learn in the end
But they say

Don't you worry about the situation
(A message from the telephone)
They out there fighting for the state of the nation
(I'm waiting a chance to come home)
They always have to fight the alienation
(I realize I'm fighting alone)
