It’s the king representing once more, you understand?
When people see me on Bankhead man on four star point, yelling screaming and waving
I don’t wanna roll over no toes in my Rolls
You just back up and let a pimp pass through you dig?

Beamers, Bentleys, double R's, Ferraris
Every time I see a shorty
Where you headed tonight?
(Hey, where you headed shorty?)
Sellin' out arenas, chicks with asses like Serena
Man, shorty live a hell of a life

Hell of a life
(I'm tryin' to tell you shorty)
Man, shorty live a hell of a live
(This is how I live, real talk, true story)
I ain't tellin' no lies
Man, shorty live a hell of a life
(I'm tryin' to tell you shorty, this is how I live, real talk, true story)

You know shorty goin' extra hard when they release his passport
Why I need a credit card? What you think this cash for?
Hit the dealership and give them every dime he ask for
Just so I can see 260 on the dashboard
If shinin' against the law, somebody better get the task force
Fuuny, hoes love me, let me fuck 'em 'til they ass hoarse
Pimpin' 101, just come and see me, take a crash course
You wanna count my money? Go to college, need a math course
On a mad dash for 100 milli runnin'
Breakneck speed 'til I see a billi comin'
I’m built to reach a hundred, feel the grumblin' in my stomach
I’m still stunting off the chain, chasing nothin' for my money
With a couple pair of queens, like I’m playing gin rummy
