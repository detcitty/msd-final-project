Ooh no-ohh, no-ohh
Ooh no-ohh, no-ohh
Ooh no-ohh, no-ohh
Ooh no-ohh, no-ohh
Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan
It ain't all good and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should it's all on you
I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you-whoahhha-ohh-yeah
I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want right
The lovin' that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's invitin' so visualize the verb
You curve thoughtways when you're handlin' the candleabra
