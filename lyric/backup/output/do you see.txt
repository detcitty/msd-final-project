The Blues has always been totally American
As American as apple pie, as American as the Blues
As American as apple pie, the question is why?
Why should the Blues be so at home here
Well, America provided the atmosphere

You don't see what I see
Every day as Warren G
I take a look over my shoulder, as I get older
Gettin' tired of mothafuckas sayin', "Warren I told ya"
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
With these funny-bunny niggaz, ain't shit changin'
Got my mama wonderin' if I'm gang-bangin'

But I don't pay attention to these father figures
I just handle mine and I'm rollin' with my niggaz
Off to the V.I.P., you see, Snoop Dogg and Warren G
Unbelievable how time just flies
Right before your eyes, but you don't recognize
Now who's the real victim, can you answer that?
The nigga that's jackin', or the fool gettin' jacked, yeah

You don't see what I see
Every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

You don't see what I see
Every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
