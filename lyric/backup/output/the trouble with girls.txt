The trouble with girls is they're a mystery
Something about em puzzles me
Spent my whole life trying to figure out
Just what them girls are all about

The trouble with girls is they're so dang pretty
Everything about them does somethin' to me
I guess that's the way it's supposed to be

They smile that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with hello
They kill you with goodbye
