Written by Natalie Cole
Gimme some time, Baby
I know you're thinking that I'm playing
But I'm saying that I wouldn't hurt you for the world, oh no
I'm not so blind, Baby
I need your lovin' and you know it (yes, I do, well) 'cause I'll show it, well
I don't wanna be hurt you
If you want me to I'll keep it a secret
