Uh, what's happenin, CC?
They still call it the White House, but that's a temporary condition too
Can you dig it, CC?
To each his reach and if I don't cop it ain't mine to have
But I'll be reachin for you cause I love you, CC
Right on

There's a lot of chocolate cities around
we got Newark, we got Gary
Somebody told me we got LA
And we workin on Atlanta

But you're the capital
Gainin on ya

Get back
Gainin on ya
Movin in on ya
Gainin on ya
Can't you feel my breath
Gainin on ya
All up around your neck

Hey, CC, they say you jive and game and can't be changed
But on the positive side, you're my piece of the rock and I love you CC
Can you dig it?

Hey, uh, we didn't get our 40 acres and a mule
