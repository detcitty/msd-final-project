Daddy's been a back-row Baptist 
With his share of front-row sin 
His Saturday night still on his breathe 
Every Sunday when he'd walk in 
He's never led the Benediction 
He's never sang in the choir 
But he's an angel with no halo 
An' one wing in the fire 

Mamma lives by the Bible 
The Bible lives by the bed 
An' she's lied alone so many nights
