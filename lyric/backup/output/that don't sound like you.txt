Girl, I'm glad you called, first heard you talk
Took me a second cause I couldn't hear your drawl
And that don't sound like you
No, that don't sound like you

I know it's been a while, I don't mean to pry
But when I asked you if you're happy I didn't hear a smile
And that don't sound like you
Nah, that ain't the girl I knew you always sounded like
