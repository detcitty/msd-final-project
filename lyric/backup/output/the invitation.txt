1!
1-2!
GRRR!

I had five hundred grams in fifty-fifty-eight bags
Four-hundred Benz eight-thousand in cash.
Then the ball dropped, GUN POPPED! - Bank$ got blast!
I make it so HOT! - One shot'll melt your ass!
GOT POPPED UP! - Probably till my eyes turned red
Told myself in the mirror nigga you ain't dead!
I'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic
I don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it!
When you see me in the hood - muhfucker don't talk to me!
'Less you wan' talk about usin' a Hawk for me.
When Al blew Black away I had 'em on some stupid shit
Then my rap shit WORKED! Now I'm super stupid rich!
