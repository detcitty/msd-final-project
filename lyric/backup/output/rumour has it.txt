There's a rumour, there's a rumour
Rumour has it

Rumour has it all around the town
someone's looking for a girl like me
where can she be found
I hope it's who I think it is
I wonder if it's really him
it's got to be the man I love
no one else but him

Rumour has it

They say he's gonna make this girl his everything
