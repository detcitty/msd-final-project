Life is so hard needlessly
No fairy tales
Tell me am I history?
A broken heart if you say good-bye

I never knew you could leave this way
Forget about what I've been through
If you should go what am I to do?

Remember we met and the room was crowded
And I can't forget the way that it started
Giving it all
Ready to fall in love

And now you're giving me a heartache
