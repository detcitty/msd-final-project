I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer tryin' to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry about me

and who I fire

I get what I desire,

it's my empire

And yes I call the shots,

I am the umpire

I sprinkle holy water

upon the vampire

In this very moment I'm king
In this very moment I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything,

that I will retire with the ring

And I will retire with the crown,

yes

No, I'm not lucky I'm blessed,

yes

Clap for the heavyweight champ,

me
