Paper bags and plastic hearts
All our belongings in shopping carts
It's goodbye, but we got one more night
Let's get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right

Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn, let it die
