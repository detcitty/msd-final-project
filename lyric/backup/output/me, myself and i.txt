All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out...

I can't believe i believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think
She was from your past
Silly of me to dream of
One day having your kids
Love is so blind

It feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me
You're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete

When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on

Cuz I realized I got
Me myself and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out

And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

Me myself and I
That's all i got in the end
