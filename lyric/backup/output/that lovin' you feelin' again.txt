Roy:
When I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
There? s just no way to hide from that old
Loving you feeling again
It? s really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you

Emmylou:
I remember how you always get
That certain look in your eyes
Your not easy to resist but I just walked on by
With that loving old feeling again

Roy:
Loving you feeling

Emmylou:
