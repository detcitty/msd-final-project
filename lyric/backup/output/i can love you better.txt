She's got you wrapped up in her satin and lace
Tied around her little finger
She's got you thinking, you can never escape
Don't you know your heart's in danger

There's a Devil in that Angel face
If you could only see
The love that you're wasting

I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm asking is for one little chance
'Cause baby, I can love you
Baby, I can love you better
