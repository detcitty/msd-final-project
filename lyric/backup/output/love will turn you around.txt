You can run, you can hide, never let it inside
keep livin your life in the dark
Sooner or later, that gentle persuader
is gonna catch up with your heart

Make you a dreamer, beliver, believin in love

Right when a man's, doin all that he planned
and he thinks he's got just what he needs
Life will deliver, a shot that will shiver him
