When I was just a, girl papa told me
Baby, you're gonna make it big one day
I know you'll do it, keep sticking to it
Just don't let anything get in your way
I'm searching for the star above
It's all that I've been dreaming of
Hey listen world to what I have to say

Chorus
One day I am gonna make it
Make it, make it to the top
Watch out, I am gonna make it
There's no way I'll ever stop

Don't need a semon cause I'm determined
To take control of my own destiny
My soul's on fire with such desire
