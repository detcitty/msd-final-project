Are You Man Enough? -from the movie "Shaft in Africa" starring Richard Roundtree
---------------------------

There's not a street that you can walk.
You got to watch just who you're talkin' to.
They're out to get ya, can't turn your back on a smilin' face.
Next thing ya know, there ain't no trace of you.
And this I betcha... some people lose, and some folks win.
It's a matter of what they do.

Are you man enough... big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries,
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend, just around the bend.
