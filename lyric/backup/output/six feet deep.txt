There's far too many of you dying

June, 28 was the date 38
Till the chest plate mommy dear's cryin' at the wake
And everybody's dressed up in black suits
Goin' to pay their last respects to the black troop

Why'd he have to die is the question that we're under
But everyone knows that everyday's a different number
So when your time comes, just remember G
You'll always have a place in this world as a memory

Especially my boys who passed away back in '92
Best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you
Wherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin'
Of how we hung in the clubs smokin' and drinkin'

Never missin' out on a hood fight
'Cause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight
Everything is changed and people are lookin' lonely
It's gonna be strange spendin' New Year's eve without your homie

But ain't much that we can do
Except pour brew throughout the crew
To make sure we all remember you
And believe me it hurts
To see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt, dirt

There's far too many of you dying
