Oh, that summer was a killer, all right
Sleeping in the back of the car at night
We had no money, we came through
You had me, baby, I had you

Out on the open road all over America
Had it made, we were getting it right
Making love on a West Coast summer night

(Summer night, summer night)
Summer night (summer night)
Summer night (summer night)
