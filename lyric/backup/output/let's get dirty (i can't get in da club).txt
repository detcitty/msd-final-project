Attention, all you niggaz, all you bitches
Time to put down the Cristal, time to take off the ice for a minute
Time to throw a little mud in this motherfucker.

{*barking*} Turn me up some
{*more barking} Yo
{*barking*}

(Red imitates an old woman)
Ohh shit! Who those motherfuckers comin in here?
No, it can't be! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

(Redman)
Yo. yo, gimme some room I'm throwin elbows
Timberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them?
If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'ma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P.
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black when I'm makin the moves
Similar to the new Playstation 2
I can't help it if the club only packin a G
And the fire marshal wanna shut it down in 3
And you ballin ass niggaz, whose dressed to kill
for the hoes showin the toes with extra heels (man!)
I gotta get in, I drove here
with a carLOAD of bitches charged on Belvedere
My niggaz hit the cells if the line is thick
So I drive the 500, through the door of the bitch

(DJ Kool)
Yo Red, wassup man?
Aiy they ain't tryin to let you in the club!
