Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I try to reach for you but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me, SOS
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, SOS
