This is where they stay crunk
Throw it up, dubs on tha Cadillac
White tees, Nikes
Gangstas don't know how to act

Adamsville, Bankhead
College Park, Carver Homes
Hummers floatin' on chrome
Chokin' on that home-grown

They got that southern cookin'
They got them fellas lookin'
Thinkin' I was easy I can see it
That's when I say no, what fo'?
Shawty, can't handle this
Ciara got that fire like

Oh, 'round here we ridin' slow
We keep it gutta, you should know
Gettin' crunk off in tha club
We gets low, oh

Oh, all my ladies to tha flo'
Handle it ladies back it up
Gettin crunk up in tha club
We gets low, oh

Buddy take a new whip
Paint strip, bowlin' ball
Still smoke unemsmote
