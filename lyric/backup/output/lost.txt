Is it obvious to you
When you walk into a room
Your face is all I see
And my heart races so fast
I never knew a rush to feel like that
Every time you're touching me

I never did believe in anything
I couldn't hold between my fingers
But the way you make me feel
It's just so real the way it lingers

I get lost
Inside your stare
Lost
When you're not there
When everything I have doesn't mean a thing
If it's without you
If it's a dream
Don't wake me up
I'll scream
If this isn't love
If bein' lost means never knowin'
