Lucky 4 you, 4 you
Lucky 4 you

You always say that I have multiple personalities
I bounce around somewhere between my dreams and reality
So where'd you dig up the audacity to ask me
How we've all been doin' since you broke our hearts
(Well so far)

Number 5 just cries a river a minute
7 wants to tie you up and drown you in it
Yeah, 14 just wants to say so long, bygones
32 wants to do things to you that'll make you blush
10 will key the el camino that you love so much
And there ain't nobody wants to mess with 23
Ohh, lucky 4 you tonight I'm just me
