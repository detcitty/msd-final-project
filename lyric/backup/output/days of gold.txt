Long truck bed hop in it
Fire engine red like her lip stick
Out here we can let it go
But just me and my good friends
Jug of wine little sip
Out here baby you just never know

Yeah, these are the days of gold
Well it's a southern summer
Whisky's in the air, dogs on the burner
Beers ice cold and got a pretty little lady to hold
Southern summer, and that sun shining down
