Here comes the rain again
Falling on my head like a memory
Falling on my head like a new emotion

I want to walk in the open wind
I want to talk like lovers do
want to dive into your ocean
Is it raining with you?

So baby talk to me
Like lovers do
Walk with me
Like lovers do
Talk to me
Like lovers do
