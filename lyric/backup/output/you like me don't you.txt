I remember when we met
Your eyes I can't forget
They told me a lot about you
From the look upon your face
This feeling I could trace
Girl? needed love
That smile you gave from my hello
Would light up my world all aglow
I just kept my cool

When you put your hand in mine
I knew that it was time
To let you know how I feel
When you kissed me by surprise
