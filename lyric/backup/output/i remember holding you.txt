Time Will Never Lose
memories We Choose
choices That We`ve
made For Love

voices In My Head
they Call Me Away
you Were Right Beside Me
i`m In Love

maybe I Should Have Known It
maybe I Should Have Seen
but I Stayed Lost In My Dreams

now That You`re Gone

(Chorus)
i Remember Holding You
feeling Felt So Right
