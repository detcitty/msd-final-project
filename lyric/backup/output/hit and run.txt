Well, well, well
Whoa, whoa

Hit and run
You were just out for fun
I thought I was the only one
Who turned you on
But I was wrong

Hit and run
Girl, you played your game so well
You really made it hard to tell
That all you were was
A one night stand

Yeah, yeah, yeah

The stage was set the day we met
I thought I had the leading part
But you lied to me and led me to believe
