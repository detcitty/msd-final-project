Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh

Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh

When you came into my life
You showed me what true love was meant to be
You brought light into my shadows
And made me be your number one priority
And when you hold me in your arms
The rest of the world seems to disappear
Im in heaven when Im with you
