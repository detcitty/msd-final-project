IT'S MURDA!

Yeah yeah, Hova Hova
We takin over soldier, told ya it's murdaa
I'm here for that paper playa, fuck one time
I'm here ta break ya playa one nine
Make ya scream and holla partner
When I block ya partner
When I squeeze niggaz breathe like
We the realest niggaz we killaz niggaz
We Murderers, feel us?

Vita Vita to all of my bitches
that's ready to flip dollars dollars
Lemme hear you holla holla
Gunshots pop up like it's murda
Ja's a murdera
I'm the murderous bitch
Semi semi automatic in my Fendi Fendi bag
for any any hoes feelin envy envy if you choose to
but I got some killers that'll bury and use you
It's murda!

Nigga we do this for the doe doe, hurtin hurtin
Y'all niggaz is curtains curtains
When the pound kick, round spit hit the ground quick
Playa playa I hate a hater whose flow flow is so-so
Midget niggaz who grow slow
