you wanna be with me
i wanna be with you
we could fly away up
in the sky
out in the blue
we'll kiss and hug
make all kinds of love
just you and me
we'll be flying free
and the starts above

deep in your eyes
i can see that
you are lonely,
come take my heart
and say you'll be
my one and only
we've been dreaming on making love
out in the moonlight,
