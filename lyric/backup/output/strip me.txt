Everyday I fight for all my future somethings
A thousand little wars I have to choose between
I could spend a lifetime earning things that I don't need
But that's like chasing rainbows and coming home empty

And if you strip me, strip it all away
If you strip me, what would you find?
If you strip me, strip it all away
I'll be alright

Take what you want
Steal my pride, build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million, but you ain't taking that from me

You ain't taking that from me
(You ain't taking that from me)
