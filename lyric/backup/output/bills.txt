I got bills I gotta pay
So I'm gon' work, work, work every day
I got mouths I gotta feed,
So I'm gon' make sure everybody eats
I got bills!

All these bills pile up my desk
They looking like a mount (Everest!)
All the little kids run around
I can hear their stomachs growl (grrr!)
It's a full moon out
And my girl just keep on howlin' (ooh, ooh)
She said she gonna leave me
If I don't come home with fifty thousand (fifty thousand?)

God damn, God damn, God damn, God damn
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man
