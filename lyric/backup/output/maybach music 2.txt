Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
Whatever I sing now homie I'm a Maybach
Can you believe that? Who
You gotta see it
'Cause I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
'Cause I'm in it to win, you all niggers can't take that
Listen to my Maybach Music, to my Maybach Music

Martin, Louiee the King Junior
Startin' all that stunti' is gonna ruin ya
B I was a lie, he probably had a two-tone
With the great poop on, anything that Ye poop on
Will explode, 'cause I am the shit and this is my kamol
Oh oh that it go
Talkin' 'bout how your boys clothes extra tight
I just remembered that my lime light extra bright
I hit the Strip Club as girls get extra hype
You hit the strip club and girls turn extra dyke
We know who not gettin' no sex tonight
And a lap dance will probably be a blessin' right
So all this shit you talkin' dead, Coffin
Like the weed coffin
New Crib: Lofton
Where is that? Austin
Where is that? Texas
What's in front: Benzes
What else? Lexus
