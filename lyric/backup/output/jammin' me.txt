You got me in a corner
You got me against the wall
I got nowhere to go
I got nowhere to fall

Take back your insurance
Baby nothin's guaranteed
Take back your acid rain
Let your T.V. bleed

You're jammin' me
You're jammin' me
Quit jammin' me
Well, you can keep me painted in a corner
You can look away, but it's not over
