Once upon a time not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck, it's tough
So tough

Gina works at diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay for love
For love

She says: We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Wooah
We're half way there
Woah-oh
Living on a prayer
