"Songbook baby,
I like to thank Mr. Bryan Michael Cox for helping me illustrate my feelings.
It's just gettin' too hot baby, it's gettin' too hot."

this The Last Time, it's the last chapter

I mean for real
This has gotta be the last time
It's gonna be the best though
I promise
Just one last time


'Cause if she catch me with you
she gon' kill us
These hotel rooms is looking too familiar
Your love is so, so serious
Girl, you keep me coming back, baby
I be with her, thinkin' of you
I be with you, thinkin' of her, my boo
She just don't deserve this
ain't nobody perfect
but I just can't take no more, 'cause...

I'm livin' two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night
And even though this ain't right,
I just can't get enough
of the way you put it down
You really got me trippin'
hold up, baby girl
Don't talk, just listen

Let's just make love
Girl, for the last time
Yep, I said the last time
Girl, this is the last time
I'm all caught up
and it's time to put it down
You really got me trippin'
