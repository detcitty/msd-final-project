You could buy me diamonds
You could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
Baby, you know I'm worth it

Dinner lit by candles
Run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last and last
Baby, you know I'm worth it

Wanna please
Wanna keep
Wanna treat your woman right

Not just told
But it's showed
That you know she is worth your time

You will lose
If you choose
To refuse
To put her first

She will
and she can
