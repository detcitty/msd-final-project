Love of a lifetime

Good for you (heart of change)
Got to be the heart of change
Good for me - a heart of change
I know we'll get it better
Stir it up (got to be)
Stir it tender heartedly
Stir it and
The whole world's gettin' better

BRIDGE:

I believe the world to be
Fast and ever changing
That's the way my love will be
Got to last and satisfy me
