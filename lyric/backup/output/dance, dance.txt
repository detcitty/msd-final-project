She says she's no good
With words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out "a joke of a romantic"
Stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too
Over-dramatic
Tonight it's "it can't get much worse"
Versus "no one should ever feel like"
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds,
These words are all I have so I'll write them
So you need them just to get by
Dance, dance
