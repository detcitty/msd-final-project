Turn it down you say
Well, all I got to say to you is time and time again I say
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tell me not to play

Well, all I got to say to you when you tell me not to play
I say
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it
There's only one thing I can say to you

I wanna rock
(Rock)
I wanna rock
(Rock)

I wanna rock
(Rock)
I wanna rock
(Rock)

There's a feelin' that I get from nothin' else
And there ain't nothin' in the world
That makes me go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Turn the power up
