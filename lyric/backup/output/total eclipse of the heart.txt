Turn around, every now and then
I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming round

Turn around, every now and then
I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
Turn around, every now and then

I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around, every now and then
I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes

Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
