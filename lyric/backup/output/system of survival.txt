The Human Race is runnin' over me
I punch a clock at 9 and 5
Just tryin' to make a livin'
A plastic face on satellite TV
Says, "Life is filled with give and take"
He's takin' and I'm givin'
So I dance

It's my system of survival (SOS)
Hey, I'm dancin'
System of survival (SOS)
It's a system of survival
Future revival
Greet the new arrival

It's a system of survival
Future revival
Greet the new arrival

At times it's the only way
I'm gonna make it through this day
