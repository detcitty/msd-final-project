I'm in love with a girl and she's in love with me
When I look to her mind I can only see tears
If she'd blow me a kiss I would wait for years
I'm in love with a girl she's in love, with...

If we wait for church now
Can we see diekirche?
Broken china on the bull platter
Time bomb tick-tickin' on
She's a foxy little thing now
I like the way she makes me swing
Like the sound of the sunday prayer
She got no time for the marble chatter
