Do you feel this?
I know you feel this
Are you ready?
I don't think so

Somebody give me my truck
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like
Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend that cash like

What you gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo?
Why you standing on the wall?
Music starting everywhere
So why don't you just move along?

I see you looking at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'?
I see you looking at me
Like I got what you need
