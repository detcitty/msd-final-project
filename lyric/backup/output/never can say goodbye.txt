Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Never can say goodbye, girl)
No no no no, I
(Never can say goodbye, girl)

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no

Tell me why
(Tell me why)
Is it so that I
(Is it so)
(Never can say goodbye, girl)
No no no no, I
