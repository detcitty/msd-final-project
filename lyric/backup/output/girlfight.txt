It's about to be a girlfight
Remix, hey, sendin' this out to all the ladies
That got beef with another ***
Just walk up to that *** and tell her, whatcha tell her?

I don't fight, I don't argue
I just hit that chick with a bottle
I don't fight, I don't argue
I just hit that chick with a bottle
(It's about to be a [Incomprehensible] girlfight)

We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swing them thangs
We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swing them thangs
It's about to be a what? Girlfight

I hit that chick wit a bottle, I hit her full throttle
Didn't think I could do it 'cause I look like a model
I'm so impossible, originated for girlfights
The first to leave a heffa in the hospital

That's me, yup, M.S.B.
Ms. Bottle Action, I swear you heffas can't see me
Y'all can't never take me an' insinuate me
Turn around an' bite me an' try to demonstrate me

Huh? How 'bout I slap ya an' hit ya with one of these
Punch ya homie in the mouth with a handful of rings
