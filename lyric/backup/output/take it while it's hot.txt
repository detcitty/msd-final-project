It's time to jam

Take it hot

So won't you come inside?

Take it while it's hot
Take it while it's hot
Give it all you've got
Take it while it's hot

I've always dreamed this was the way that it could be
Just like a fantasy, you're here along with me
So now it seems we've slipped into reality
And it's plain to see this is our destiny
