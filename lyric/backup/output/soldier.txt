They way you got it I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' them impalas around it
With the top down feeling' the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs
Ridin' hard than guys
With the chrome wheels at the bottom
White leather inside
With them flames spittin' at you tell them don't even try it
Shoot it Chelle and kick it with Kelly
Or holla a B
You got to be G's you way out of your league

We like them boys who be in them 'lacs leanin'
Open they mouth they grill gleamin'
Candy paint keep that wheel clean and
They always be talkin' that country slang
We like

They keep that beat that be in the beatin'
Eyes be so low from the chiefin'
I love how he keep my body screamin'
A rude boy thats good to me
With street credibility

If yah status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for them
Betta be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things if yah know what I mean

If yah status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for them
Betta be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier that ain't scared to stand up for me
Got to know to get dough and he betta be street

We like them boys up top from the BK
Know how to split the money three ways
Always ridin' big on the freeway
With that East Coast slang that us country girls
We like

Low cut Caesar's with the deep wave
So quick to snatch up yo Beyonce
Always comin' down boppin' our way
Tellin' us that country girls the kind of girls
They like
