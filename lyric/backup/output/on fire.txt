(Lloyd Banks Talking)
New York City
You are now rockin with the best
Lloyd Banks
G-Unit

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
We on fire
Up in here, it's burnin hot
We on fire
Shawty take it off if it get too hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this ma'a'fucker, light the roof on fire
(Nigga wutchu say?)
We gettin loose in this muh'fucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire

(Verse 1 - LLoyd Banks)
Naw I aint puttin nuttin' out, I smoke when I wanna
26 inch chrome spokes on a Hummer
This heat gon' last for the whole summer
