Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way

Oh no! the fight's out
I'm about to punch yo, lights out
Get the fuck back, guard ya grill
There's somethin' wrong, we can't stay still
I've been drinkin' and buzzin' too
And I been thankin' of bustin' you
Upside ya motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in
"Oh girl", they'll be more dead

Causin' confusion, disturbin' tha peace
Its not an illusion, we runnin' the streets
So bye-bye to all you groupies and golddiggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? No nigga
I'm doin' a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the fuck outta my way
I'm DUI, hardly ever caught sober
And you about to get ran the fuck over
