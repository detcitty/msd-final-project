Here we are together
In a place, in a space surrounded with love
Here to say
(Yes, I do)
I love you and I wanna be the only one

'Cause you, you are
(You are just the one, I want to spend the rest of my life with)
I wanna spend the rest of my life
(You are just the one to bring out the very best in me)
You make me so happy
(You make me so happy)
Happy forever
(Happy forever)
And that’s a mighty long time

We must be in
We must be in love

Yes, I've reconciled in my mind
That you are the only one for me
Yes, I've been around
And to this day, no one has made me as happy as you

‘Cause you are the one
(You are just the one, I want to spend the rest of my life with)
