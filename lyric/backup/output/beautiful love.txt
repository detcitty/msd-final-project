Far away, I feel your beating heart
All alone, beneath the crystal stars
And staring into space, what a lonely face
I'll try to find my place with you

What a beautiful smile
Can It stay for a while
On this beautiful night
We'll make everything right
My beautiful love
My beautiful love
Larger then the moon, my love for you
