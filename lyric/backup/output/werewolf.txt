Mama said, there's
Something weird 'bout Billy
I looked in his room, his bed
Wasn't slept in at all last night

But Papa said, ah, now Mama
Don't you go talking silly
He's just a young boy
He's just sowing his wild oats
And that's all right

But Mama said, no
There's something real
Strange bout my Billy
The farmer down the road said he
Lost a few of his sheep last night

I know he's my own flesh and blood
