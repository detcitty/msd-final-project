One, two, three, baby, don't think twice
Just like that you gotta brand new life
Hop in this truck, run through the red lights

Yeah, where you wanna go, baby, name the town
We can go up north, we could head down south
Roll down the windows with the radio loud

Come on, turn it up, yeah
Start living your life on the double
Leave your troubles behind
You and me, we're gonna be alright

You could be a black bird on the country street
Hiding from the world with a broken wing
