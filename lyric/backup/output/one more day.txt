RALPH
Yeah, I can't deny it
On the inside, I'm slowly dyin'
But with a little love, it'll be alright
Just give me One More Day
I promise I'll make it up to you
I never meant to hurt you, baby
Just trust me... listen...

Verse 1:
RICKY
I can't deny it
That you got me cryin' you see
And I'm, I'm slowly dyin'
So we can't give up tryin' to be
