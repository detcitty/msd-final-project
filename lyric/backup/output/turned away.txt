Turned away, turned away
Turned away, turned away
From love

Too many times I feel
We are losing time once shared
And only when you're in ecstasy
You seem to really care

Didn't you say not to worry
I can only speak for myself
How do you think that I'm happy, baby
With a love like mine
Locked up on a shelf
