Baby, you better quit… Umm!

Well keep on doin' whatcha doin'…Yeah
Feels so good to me
Keep on doin' whatcha doin', Lady
Ooh, you feel so good to me

Girl, I went to see my doctor and he told me
Well… From your lovin' I've got to stay away
He told me to let you go
For my heart can't stand much mo'
And there oughta be a law against lovin' a man this way

Aww, but I can't get enough of your lovin' - No, Lord
And my need keeps getting stronger everyday
Girl, I've got just one life to live
And a lotta love to give and give
