Ho oh
Oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah

Sitting here
Daydreamin' about you
Oh, everything we had
Wish I could get it back

'Cause if it ain't you, then I don't want it
And if it ain't you, then it ain't for me
I can see your face whenever I be sleepin'
But it hurts when I realize I'm dreamin'

So if I can't have you
I'll just be single for the rest of my life
 (My life)
'Cause you can't be replaced by nobody else
 (No oh)
I'll go crazy if I can't have you for myself
 (If I can't have you)

If I can't have you
 (I'll be)
I'll just be single for the rest of my life
 (Oh)
