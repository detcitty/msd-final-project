Hey, hey hold up a minute
Let me stop up here and use this pay phone real quick.
(Dialing/Ringing)
Hey, hey Toni it's me just callin' ya know
Just callin' to let you know
Dont wait up for me tonight.
I mean I just got a couple of things on my mind
I gotta think about you know
Just erm...
I'll be over at Brian's house
You know just for tonight.
I mean, I mean I dont think it's any different
But you know it's not you, it's me
You know, it's really me
You know.
Basically I just think I'ma need some space...

Why you callin' me on the phone?
Why you not at home on time?
You say you're stayin over your friends
'Cuz you've got alot on your mind.
