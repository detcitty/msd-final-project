I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want them fans jumpin'
I want them fists pumpin' in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't you fill your cups?

Shady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup
You can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much T-N-T
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs

Can help you to resuscitate, you bustas must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
What's my name? Shady came and crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them 'cause they pale in comparison

So much they might as well wear a skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit is getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin

'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
Da dee da dee da da dee
He makes it look so easy
Girl you just hit the lottery

Now this would be the part of the song
Where they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We still gonna make it stick no matter what we do
