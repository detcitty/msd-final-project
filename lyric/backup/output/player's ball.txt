Intro: the scene was so thick, low rides, '77 sevilles, El dawgs
nothin' but them 'lacs, all the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking about a black man's heaven, yea know what I'm saying?
peace

Verse 1: (andre 3000)
it's beginning to look a lot like what?
follow my every step, take notes on how I crept
I'm 'bout to go in depth, this is the way I greet
my reason here's my ghetto rep, I kept
to say, the least no no it can't cease
so I begin to piece my two and two together, gots no snowy weather
have to find something to do better bet!
I said subtract so shut up that, nonsense about some solid, solid I got
say crunk if it ain't real, it ain't right, I'm like no matter what the season
forever chill with Smith I sip my fifth I chill with Wesson
I got my reason so tell me what did you expect?
you thought I'd break my neck to help y'all deck the halls oh
naw I got no other means of celebrating, I'm getting blizzard at ho-jo
I gots that hoochie waiting, I made it through to another year
