Call, call my name
Call it, call my name

Heard your voice this morning, calling out my name,
It had been so long since I heard it, that it didn't really sound quite the same, no
But it let me know, that my name had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you through the bridal path door,

And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you,
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth
