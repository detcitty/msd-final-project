We may still have time, we might still get by
Every time I think about it, I want to cry
With the bombs and the devil and the kids keep coming
Nowhere to breathe easy, no time to be young

But I tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight

But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohh
