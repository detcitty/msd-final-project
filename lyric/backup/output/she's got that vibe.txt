A yo R. Kelly
What's up man
You been spending a lot of time with this girl man
I don't know man
She just got that vibe you know what I'm saying
Aiight tell em the script
Aiight bet

Vibe, vibe, vibe
You've got that vibe
Vibe, vibe, vibe
You've, you've, you've got that
Vibe, vibe, vibe
Girl you've got
That vibe

Ooh, stop the press
Girl you turn me on
And I wonder
If I could take you home
I must confess
The tight mini-skirt you wear
I just can't help it baby
I can't help but stare
So
Tell the DJ
To pump it up a little more
Hey girl
I gotta let you know
That you've got that vibe

It's one o'clock
And the party's just beginning
