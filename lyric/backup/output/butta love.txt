Hsss ugh
I gotta be real wit' you, baby
Just gotta let you know

You've got the love that I want (That's right)
The love that I need (Word is bond, it's butta, baby)
(Check this out)

You're like my homie, my shorty, you've shown me so many things
And you're so special to me
We been kickin' it for a while, your sexy smile, Prima Donna style
Ooh, you're drivin' me so wild (so wild)

Ain't got no reputation, educated conversation
And, ooh, you've got that bomb love makin'
It's more than sexual, this love you know, is proper dough
It's, oh, so, so incredible

You've got the love that I want (The love you want)
And you've got the love that I need (The love you need)
Girl, it's so smooth and so creamy (You know, you know)
You've got that butta love, baby (You've got that butta love, baby)
