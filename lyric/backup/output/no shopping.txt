Sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank
Sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank
All about the mula, all about the mula
Word to the bird, I ain't never take her fur shoppin'

Runnin' through them keys way before Khaled
Runnin' with the pushas way before Malice
Word to the five, I'm the one like four minus
Caught her off the rebound, Ben Wallace, gave her four dollars
Sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank
Sippin' on the drank, I ain't tryna think
When it get hot, bodies start droppin'
Hit the strip club, told them hoes gon' get the moppin'
Word to Diddy, we Cirocin'
Word to Biggie, we'll be Pac-in'
I just bought Selena's crib, I'm poppin'
I just told Drizzy, "Let me take Serena to the tropics"
Sippin' on the drank, sippin' on the drank
Sippin' on the drank, I ain't tryna think
Sittin' high, 6 God cover
