If you wanna be with me, yeah
Let me hear you say Warren G, Warren G
(Yeah yeah)
If you wanna be with me, well well well
Let me hear you say Warren G, Warren G
(Yeah)

Smokin' me out to the finish, I thought you knew
I thought they knew, who was up in this
Ron Isley, I's be Warren G
Baby said, would ya please come roll deep

Chocolate Thai, I said
I got the Hennessey chaser, skirt you look fly
Peepin' them lips, hittin' two finger sips
On the 710 freeway, I straight dips

Wit a fat one rolled up to puff
I'm ready to hit it and I won't quit it until I get enough
Tokin' nothing but the bomb that's without no doubt
As she twist up another split she's straight smokin' me out

She's smokin' me out, smokin' me out
Smokin' me out, oh no
Oh, she's smokin' me out with the homey's love
