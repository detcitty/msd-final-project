[CHORUS]
Seems, that thinking about what to do
Boy I think about part of you
Is in my nature
Ooooh my temperature goes to rise
And snow so fast, is in my nature

You know it's true I'm part of you
And I'm afraid nothing to do,
Baby I call you
Baby I call you
It's been a while and we let's talk
Wish your body that I'll stop
Baby come give to me

No love just sex and a good time
