And I wouldn't be me
If I didn't get a little nasty
They say all I ever talk about is sex

How 'bout we just move over
And do it where we at?
How 'bout you just lift that skirt up
Ooh, we can be bad

That place that ain't been touched
I'm finning on it
I'll let you sit through, keep spinning on it
Girl, giddy up, giddy up, take me on a ride to ecstasy

You don't wanna bump, bump, then take a nap
You just wanna bump, bump, bring it right back
Watch me
I'ma heat it up, beat it up, oh

Know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual

Unusual, unusual
I'm not gon' with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual

I wanna do the wicked things you never do
