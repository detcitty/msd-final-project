Now one day, girl
All of our dreams will come true
If you believe in me like I believe in you
Someday, girl we'll be together

I can see it all in visions of white
A long train in the stained glass light
Someday, you can be mine forever
'Cause sometime I can see it all
In my dreams
Wakin' up next to you
And walkin' around with my head on the ceiling
