Yeah, when I feel that music
Rockin' on my soul
Devil's got his hold on me,
I love that rock and roll.

Hey, hey, Music Eyes,
Play a tune for me
I'm lookin' for surprises,
Somethin' new to be
Send me your sweetest notes,
Send them through the night.
Like a good-time story,
It's just turning out all right.

Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.
Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.
Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.
Nah, nah, na-na-na-nah.
