Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Another dimension, another dimension

Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around I'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile

Style, profile, I said
It always brings me back when I hear, "ooh child"
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathon to the very last mile

Well, if you battle me, I will revile
People always sayin' my style is wild
You've got gall, you've got guile (guile)
To step to me, I'm a rapophile
