This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something – fuckin' acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end
It ain't over 'til I say it's over – enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves, when the thought
Of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff, came up rough
Came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt

Cause this is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
