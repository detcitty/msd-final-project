I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And she's taken almost all that I've got
But if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know

The first cut is the deepest
Baby I know, the first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky she's cursed
