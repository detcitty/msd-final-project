Never, never say never again
Never, never say never again

You walk in a room
A woman can feel the heat
One look is a guarantee
Nights could be, long and sweet

The message is clear
And like nothing I've ever known
But from all that I hear
Forget about long range plans
'Cause this man's got his own!
