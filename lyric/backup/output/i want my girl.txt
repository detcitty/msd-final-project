My broken heart made it quite able to say
She was a devil in disguise
I loved her and she loved me, so she said
Should have known I wasn't the only one

But it really didn't matter to me
I was too blind with the love to see she only havin' fun
And my friends say that I'm a fool, a victim of her crime
But to me there'll never be another love
