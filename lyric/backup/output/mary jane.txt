Come here, baby. Mary, I love you. Do it girl.

Mary Jane, Mary Jane

I'm in love with Mary Jane.
She's my main thing.
She makes me feel alright.
She makes my heart sing.
And when I'm feeling low,
She comes as no surprise.
Turns me on with her love.
Takes me to paradise.

Do you love me, Mary Jane?
Yeah. Whoa-oh-oh.
