4 am you call to spit some fire out
Did you think that I would listen to you now?
It's nothing new, so get in line with all the rest
And I will wait till you realize you're out of breath

Can you hear the crowd?
They all go wild
For you and your denial
They're watching you break down
(Break down)
Hate me all you want I'll be okay
I'm half the world away
I'm letting you go now
(Go now)
