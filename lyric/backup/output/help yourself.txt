Aahhh, I just want to let you people know, yeah
True love is hard to find and that's yourself

Aahhh, I just want to let you people know
That, my son, when you find the one you want
Don't let it go, no, no, no, no, no

Yeah, I'll send you my loving
If you want me to
I'd do anything you want
If you ask me to

Well, I work my fingers
'Til they're black and blue
All I've got to do is the one thing
I'm gonna ask of me

Help yourself to my love and affection (Mmm-hmm)
