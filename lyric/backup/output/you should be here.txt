It's perfect outside
It's like God let me dial up the weather
Got the whole crew here
I ain't seen some of them in forever
It's one of those never forget it,
better stop and take it in kinda scenes.
Everything's just right yeah except for one thing

You should be here,
standing with your arm around me here
