We were at a party
His ear lobe fell in the deep
Someone reached in and grabbed it
It was a rock lobster

Rock Lobster!

Rock Lobster!

We were at the beach
Everybody had matching towels
Somebody went under a dock
And there they saw a rock
It wasn't a rock
It was a rock lobster

Rock Lobster!

((High Pitched)) Rock Lobster!

Motion in the ocean
His air hose broke
Lots of trouble
Lots of bubble
He was in a jam
