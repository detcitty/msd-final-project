Oh, yeah.
She says: "Don't stare at me."
She's afraid that I might see,
Those five extra pounds she talks about.
Man, I don't know what she's talking about.

She looks through magazines.
With every page she dreams of,
Looking like somebody else.
I wish she wasn't so hard on herself.
Then she falls asleep with just my T-shirt on,
An' even when her hair's messed up and her make-up's gone,

You can't hide beautiful.
You can't hide wonderful.
