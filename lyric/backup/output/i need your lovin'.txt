Love's fever comin' on strong
I don't want the fire without the flame, no
Mother Nature gave me two hands to hold you
I'm not talkin' pressures or material gains

But M O N E Y never did a thing for L O V I N
I'll never understand what people's heads are in
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin' or just a little time
I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin' or just a little time, this will do

Just a little lovin', this will do
Just a little lovin' this will do
Just a little lovin' this will do
Just a little lovin', me and you

Love's comin', so glad you're mine
I don't want your rhythm without your rhyme, no
