I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet there's nothin' but a towel on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumpin'
But he ain't got nothin' on you
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss, then lockin' the door yeah
Sounds like leavin' you, oh

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Mmm mmm mmm
