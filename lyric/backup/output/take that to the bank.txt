Take that to the bank
Take that to the bank

A long time we stayed together
Been through the roughest weather, you and I
Still rich with love
We never had to borrow
And baby, only we know why

I’m so glad I saved my love for you
And I did what I had to do
I invested my heart so free

For what you gave me

Open your account to me
‘Cause I’ll give you security, my love
Take that to the bank
My interest is strong
