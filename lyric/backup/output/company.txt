Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
Tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

You ain't gotta be my lover
For me to call you baby
Never been about no pressure
