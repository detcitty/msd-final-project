(I'm never gonna stray away, baby)
(Never gonna stray away)

In these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, no
In these changing times

How much of a sinner do you see (Stay away)
Mind you, how you miss the scenery
That's why the day
The love don't last
(Stay away)
Makes life movin'
Much too fast
(I'm never gonna stray away, baby)
Never, never, never ever leave
(Never gonna stray away)
Oh, no
