I thought it was over, baby
We said our goodbyes
But I can't go a day
Without your face
Goin' through my mind

In fact, not a single minute
Passes without you in it
Your voice, your touch,
Memories of your love
Are with me all of the time

Let me let go, baby
Let me let go
If this is for the best
Why are you still in my heart
