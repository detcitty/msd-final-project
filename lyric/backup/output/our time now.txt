Oh, oh, oh, oh

There will be no rules tonight
If there were we'd break 'em
Nothing's gonna stop us now
Let's get down to it
Nervous hands and anxious smiles
I can feel you breathing
This is right where we belong
Turn up the music

Oh, oh, oh, oh

This is the dance for all the lovers
Takin' a chance for one another
Finally it's our time now
