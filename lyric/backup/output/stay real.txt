I.

It's on breaker 1, 2 mike checkin'
flexin no half steppin
when I release the funky weapon
like Ricochet ping ping ping.
I make fans fell it even when I sing.
The green eyed bandit coming funky with the tune yes
I'm blowing up like Tom Berringer in Platoon.
I'm playing kinda ruff like Zapp
whapp and E-Double smack to all the crossover raps black
who ain't down with the format
when you should be wearing khakis and not dress slacks
that's wack
you trippin you better wake up and smell the coffee
and then back up off me
I serious I can't believe some people letting frontiers in
and then compare them equal boy you must be buggin
