Jumping with my boy, Sid
Right here in the city.
Don't you know that is was grand?
Really grand, so grand.
And then you came along,
Then you came along, boy.
And sang your groovy song,
Sang a song and I asked:

Mr. Whatchacallem, whatcha doing tonight?
Hope you're in the mood
Because I'm feeling just right.
How's about a corner
With a table for two?
Where the music's mellow
Is a gay rendezvous.
There's no chance romancing
With a blue attitude.
You know you got to do some dancing
To get in the mood.

Mr. Watchacallem, I'm indebted to you.
You're here. It goes to show what good influence can do.
