Woah, it's the remix
Woah, it's the remix
Woah, it's the remix
Woah, Genuine

Chitti chitti bang bang boom like a pow
Everybody up in the club gettin' wild
Drinks everywhere, the crowd is real loud
Looks like we gonna be here for a while
I'm so drunk, I'm just droolin' at the mouth
Tryin' to get somebody to take me to my house, so
So now where my car keys at? And where my money at?
I'm gonna follow y'all to the, ah, where the honeys at
Gimme some cheese, eggs, steaks and grits
And hit the after party with G and them boys Clipse

Your a ooo ooo ooo
Look out for the po po
Ooo ooo ooo
Smokin' on the dro dro
In them Air Force One's and all white band new tees
Plus I got these two honeys tryin' juke on me
You've got the ignition and girl, I've got the key
It's the Pide Piper so people follow me

So fresh, so fly, so sweet, so polite
So much too many 'cause we ridin' tonight
And it's that pimp talk, that pimp walk
It's big pimpin' over here, playa ya just start
See we're fresh with Air One's, Lexus and big drums
