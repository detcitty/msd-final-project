All night, these days, people are playing
Game ball off the wall with the head
The man promised me a raid (I said who?)
Who's gonna raid me when I'm dead?

Oh, I'm so tired of putting that clock every day (Working every day)
All day skatin' on thin ice
Lord knows we could use a holiday, baby
Just the two of us would be so nice

Gimme the bon
Gimme the bon, bon
Gimme the bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie
Gimme the good life (Give it to me)

Gimme the bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon vie
Oh, gimme the good life (Oho, baby)
