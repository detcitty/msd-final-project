Yeah
Shorty I know what you need
I got everything you need
I promise I ain't gonna hold out either
I'ma give it all to you baby
It's on, bust it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it

Baby if you give it to me

I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me

I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it
We been together for a few years
Shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames
Like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road

Hardly ever home
Always busy this busy that
Can't talk on the phone
I know you aggravated
Walk around frustrated
Patience gettin' short
How long can you tolerate it
Listen ma I'm just motivated
I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now
Ayo to really be honest
You stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't express the words
How much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man never above ya
I can tell that you different from most

Slightly approach you
And that ill shit about it
We gon' sex every day
