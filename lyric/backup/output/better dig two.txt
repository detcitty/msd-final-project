I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I wear white

So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose
Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I'll see you with someone else

Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say

Here lies the girl whose only crutch
