All I hear is raindrops falling on the rooftop
Oh baby, tell me why'd you have to go
'Cause this pain I feel it won't go away
And today I'm officially missin you

I thought that from this heartache, I could escape
But I've fronted long enough to know
There ain't no way
And today, I'm officially missing you

Ooh... can't nobody do it like you
