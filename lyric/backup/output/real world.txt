Well I wonder what it's like to be the rainmaker
I wonder what it's like to know that I made the rain
I'd store it in boxes with little yellow tags on every one
And you can come and see them when I'm done, when I'm done

I wonder what it's like to be a super hero
I wonder where I'd go if I could fly around downtown, yeah
From some other planet, I'd get this funky high on the yellow sun
Boy I bet my friends will all be stunned, they're stunned
