Sometimes at the end of a day, another battle won
I sit down, take a look at my life, and all the things I have done
Even if I had the chance, I wouldn't change a thing

It's for you
It's for you

The world has gone crazy trying to compete
Got my eyes on a better life, but I'm still trying to make ends meet
