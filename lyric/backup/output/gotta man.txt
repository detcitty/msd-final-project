Gotta man that I think I'm gon love forever (ugggg)
And forever we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love him I'm gonna love him

1) Yo yo Sexy lookin like love no doubt
Sophisticated thug keep me guessin
Said it would be a blessin just to watch you undressin
Callin you daddy late nights I'm layin on your chest
And, stay reminiscin bout the rest
And, how they less than, tryin to come between what we share
Can't compare, could've been left, but when It's mine
I never share, fight to the death
If need be to prove that, wounds from your war
Other chicks couldn't soothe that, broke from a bad back
I'm holdin you down, throwin dirt with other pigeons
But them other fishes drown, locked in, however long
I'm playin it smart, court dates in other cities
There I'm doin my part, Wife-y, In your life see
Forever be us, passin the side of a Bentley
Or the number 2 bus, tell the whole world, papi
Eve don't want nobody else, with other dogs pick and choose
But you, I'm keepin for myself

Gotta man that I think I'm gon love forever (ugggg)
And forever we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
