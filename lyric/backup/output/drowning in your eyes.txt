Feel the ground it's slipping away
Like a sigh that greets the close of day
Feel the waters welcoming arms
Embrace me in their quiet karma
I can't hear what you say anymore
Just the sound of trees on the ocean floor
Irresistibly drawn from the shore

I'm drowning in your eyes
I'm floating out to sea
Helpless on the restless tide
That flows between you and me
