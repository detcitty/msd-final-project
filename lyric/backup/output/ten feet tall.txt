I'm clumsy, yeah my head's a mess
'Cause you got me growing taller everyday
We're giants in a little man's world
My heart is pumping up so big that it could burst
Been trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars and boats
I swear I could touch the sky
Ohhh ohh ohhh
I'm ten feet tall
