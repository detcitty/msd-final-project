(I am the doctor
Please report to the dance floor)

Unknown, unseen
We live underneath the radar
No sign upon screen
We dance underneath the radar

Between the walls, well hey
We're just too small to make a fuss about it
Did something fall? Well, hey
What is the point in losin' sleep about it?

See ya later, see ya later
Hip-a-no-no-no-no
Hip-a-no-no-no-no
See ya later, call me

We dance underneath the radar
We live underneath the bomb
When you live underneath the radar
