Shot through the heart,
And you're to blame!

Darlin', you give love a bad name
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me

When passion's a prison you can't break free
Oh! You're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh! There's nowhere to run
No one can save me,

The damage is done
Shot through the heart,
And you're to blame!
You give love a bad name
(Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
