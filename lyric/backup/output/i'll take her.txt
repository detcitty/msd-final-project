[Verse One: Al Skratch]

Yeah, it's Al Skratch, that real smooth brother
The undercover lover makin moves on your mother
If I have to, it's only natural, that I rap to
Any girl walkin through my hood if she's lookin good
And if she's somethin fine, I'll be humpin hind
Let's get it on, ain't nuthin wrong, with a little Bump N Grind
(Bump N Grind) Now that's what my man say
Sometimes I lay in my bed, and I dream of bein hand-fed
I made the jam, with my man, about the _Homiez_
But now I must remember all about my tenderonis
You're lonely by your homey baby I know how you're feelin
You in the mood for some Sexual Healing (sexual healing!)
Walk in to the jump I spot you as the music's blarin
Starin, but not - carin, about, what you - wearin
You're full grown with a mind of your own
I make you moan as my bone turn brick like stone
Whether you're single we can mingle as you jingle
Swing low, with the black Mandingo
I be the dough money-maker rump-shaker
To the bedroom I said "hmm I'll take her"
