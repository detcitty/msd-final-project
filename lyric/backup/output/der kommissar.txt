Zwei drei vier one two three
It's easy to see
But it's not that I don't care so
'Cause I hear it all the time
But they never let you know
On the TV and the radio
She was young her heart was pure
But every night is bright she got
She said sugar is sweet
She come rappin' to the beat
Then I knew that she was hot

She was singin'
Don't turn around, uh oh
Der Kommissar's in town, uh oh
You're in his eye
And you'll know why
The more you live
The faster you will die

Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?
