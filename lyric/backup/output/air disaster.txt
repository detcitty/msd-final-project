The engines spit out fire
I'm pushed back in my chair
The pressure gives me thrills
As we climb in the air

And I love to watch the clouds
And the mountains and the sky
Swish around a cocktail
The stewardess brings by

Lord, this is the life for me
Lord, oh, Lord
This is the life for me

But I don't wanna die
In an air disaster
I don't wanna die on a plane

Well, I fishtail through the lanes
And I make my tires squeal
