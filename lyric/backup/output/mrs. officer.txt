When I get up all in ya (yeah)
We can hear the angels calling us (chea)
We can see the sunrise before us (yeah)
And when I’m in that thang, I’ll make that body sang
(Diesel on the beat) I make it say…
Wee ooh wee ooh wee (ay)
Wee ooh wee ooh wee (ay)
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
(Like a cop car)
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
Wee ooh wee ooh wee (ay)
Wee ooh wee ooh wee (hahaha)…
I’ll make ya say…

(Yeahh)… doing a buck in the latest drop
I got stopped by a lady cop
Ha ha… she got me thinking I can date a cop
Ha ha… cause her uniform pants are so tight
She read me my rights
She put me in a car, she cut off all the lights
She said I had the right to remain silent
Now I got her hollering sounding like a siren
Talkin’ bout…
(Wee ooh wee ooh wee) yea
(Wee ooh wee ooh wee) yea
(Wee ooh wee ooh wee) yea
And I know she the law and she know I’m the boss
And she know I get high a-bove the law
And she know I’m raw, she know it from the street
And all she want me to do is fuck the police
