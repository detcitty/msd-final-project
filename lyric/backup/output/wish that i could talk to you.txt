(Leon Sylvers III)

Into my life
There comes a change
That makes me feel like crying
I blame on your love
And when you left
Girl, I just felt like dying

I, I, I, I wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
(So that I can let you know, I)
I wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
(So that I can let you know)
Where I stand

I'm sorry I said
