Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doin'
Every time we lie girl we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
