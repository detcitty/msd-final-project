Straight to the point
At a half past five
Last thing on my mind
Was trying to wine and dine
Another heiny

Shoot, you could
Just knock those boots

What you see is what you get
And, baby, let me tell you
You ain't seen nothing yet

Watch your funky
Tip on my eyebrow
I wanna give your hip
Lotta pop now

How about a drink
Do you think we could
Spend a little time
Your place or mine

You're so fine
Do you mind a little kiss on
The hand from the Candyman

And as we dance, by any chance
Could I have your number
