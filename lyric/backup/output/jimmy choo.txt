My Beamer sit on Jimmy Choos, damn
My bitch, I buy her Jimmy Choo's, damn
My neck a buncha frozen jewels, damn
I can show you what them Benji's do, damn
Benjamin's bring them finer things, damn
That what you want, then go on, get it baby, damn
I hit a lick, ain't have to split it, baby, damn
A hunnid thou in all fifties, baby
Robin jeans and some Jimmy Choo's, damn
All wings, I don't do the True's, damn
Robin jeans and some Jimmy Choo's, damn
