Cue the music out the driveway
Slow simmer on a Friday
Here we go again, wild in the wind
Mama knows she's gonna be late

Hit the party just to watch her dance
Good to go when she grabs your hand
Like a shot from a gun, it's a dead run
The first leg of a getaway plan

You burn rubber when you smoke them tires
Day's done and the night's on fire

She's telling you turn off the highway
