We were half a mile high on the ferris wheel at our old county fair
I didn't even know we had trouble until she told me way up there
That's when my life started spinning round
My world came crashing to the ground the day that she left Tulsa

In a chevy, in a hurry, in the pourin' down rain
With the caution lights flashin', in the passin', lane
