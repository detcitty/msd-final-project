Together we made it
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall

See a nigga survived the worst but my life is glorious
But I know that I live to be hurdled and I'm so victorious
Take a look I'm a symbol of greatness now call a nigga Morpheus
As force accumalted the wind and but a believe I'm so notorious
You know I've been buying my bread even though we rapping now (yes)
And now when you look on my trip and you a nigga higher level tramping now
And you see that everyone on my middle struggles and
For your ass is never been an option
A nigga paper long like we was on the trap and I'm about to take the hood choppin
Get it!

Together we made it (you see we did it niggas)
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (c'mon)
Forever we waited (haha!)
