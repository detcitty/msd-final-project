What's happening, baby
Did you miss me over the weekend
If you did, I'm sorry

But now that I'm here
I don't want to bore you
With an irrelevant conversation
But you see, darling
It's about time for me to
Get real serious about you

Because if someone was
To rip me off of you
I couldn't account for
My actions, after all
And knowing the way I feel
Knowing that you should
