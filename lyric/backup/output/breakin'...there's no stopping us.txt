{Do it}
{Hold on}

Out in the street
You don't survive by being weak
This is our time
Walls were made for us to climb

Don't you try to lock us out
Cause we're breakin' down the doors
And all we're prepared to fight
Yeah, yeah

There's no stoppin' us {No stoppin'}
No one does it better {No one does it better}
There's no stoppin' us {No stoppin'}
Really doesn't matter

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

Long overdue
No playin' game or being used
Something to prove
It's more than just a dream come true

We have waited far too long
