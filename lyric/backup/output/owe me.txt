All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right, though
'Cause you so fucking outta line
Forever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine
Taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

Feel like you owe me checks
Owe me time, owe me sex
Long nights, no reply
I don't got no regrets, you disrespect
Disrespect only time I seen you now is on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to
You got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals
Now you back, it's our revival
They don't make you feel like I do
They didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
