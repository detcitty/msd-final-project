Inside and out inside, outside
Inside, Inside and outside, outside, outside
Inside, outside, Inside and out

When I first met you boy, I would not give you a play
Your reputation as a Playboy scared me away
But you persisted and you captured me with all your charms
And you insisted that the place for me was in your arms

Now things have changed, now things have changed
You're acting strange
Got me so confused I just can't take it anymore

You got me inside, outside, spinning all around
Everytime I look for you, you're nowhere to be found
Inside, outside, hung up over you
Filled up with emotions and I don't know what to do
