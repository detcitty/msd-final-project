Do you want me to
Get down on my knees
Beg you baby, please
Cry a million tears
Do you want me to
Call you on the phone
Beg you to come home
Think of all the years
When I once lived in paradise
When the love light shone in your eyes
Chorus:
Oh baby
What can I do when I still love you
What can I say when I still want you
What can I do
What can I say
You'll never know this way
