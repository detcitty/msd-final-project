(Tonight, ah, tonight)

I'm puttin' on my makeup
It's time to wake up
The owners of the night are calling me
I'm ready and I'm willing
To pull out the happy feeling
Something special's in the air for me

The night is mine
I'm gonna keep it just right
An angel in my pocket, right?
Feels so right
This mirror's tellin' no lie
Gonna let this magic shine

CHORUS:
