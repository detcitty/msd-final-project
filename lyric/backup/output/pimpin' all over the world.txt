Oh yeah

The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are, 'cause we pimpin' all over the world

Sing it, sing it
All over the world, the world

All over the world baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
'Cause I've been places where you'll never imagine
But I'ma start at home, when I see a girl I like

I walk straight up to her and I'm like 'Ugh, hey girl how ya doin''
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name
And you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, hey

See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin' of me
We got people to meet and many places to see, hey

I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
