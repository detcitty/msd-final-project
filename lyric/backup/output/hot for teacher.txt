(Oh, wow, man, I said
Wait a second, man
What do you think the teacher's gonna look like this year?
Primus man!)

Oh yeah, t-t-teacher stop that screamin'
Teacher don't you see? Don't wanna be no uptown fool
Maybe I should go to hell but I am doing well
Teacher needs to see me after school

I think of all the education that I've missed
But then my homework was never quite like this
