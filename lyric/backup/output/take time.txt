Take time, show me, love me
You know what I won't treat you good
Take time, show me, love me

You, the thought of you, brings happiness to me
I can't deny it no more, you mean more than the world to me
In every word that you say, in everything that you do
I want you to know, my heart belongs to you and there's no

No need to play along
It's not like we don't know what's going on
There's one thing that I want you to do for me and that is

Take time, show me, how much you love me, oh
Take time, show me, how much you love me
