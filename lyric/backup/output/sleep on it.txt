[Verse 1 - Aundrea]
I might like to get to know you
But I can't hear you right now,
You're competing with the music
But the music's way too loud
[Aubrey]
Why don't you write down your number and slip it to me?
But you gotta maneuver discreetly,
I don't want my business leaking people like run their mouth.

[Hook - Wanita + (Group)]
I don't need no pressure from you
(I don't need pressure, no pressure, no)
Don't need no lectures from you.
So just give me one night and I'ma

[Chorus - Group]
Sleep on it, sleep on it
And I'll get back at ya when I wanna
Sleep on it, sleep on it
You can keep popping off if ya wanna
