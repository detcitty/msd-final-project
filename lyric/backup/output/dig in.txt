It's time to face and come-on in and join the party
Life has been waiting for you to care
Don't try to fake it, jump on in and get it started
There's so much lovin for you to share!

There is nowhere to run
There is no way to hide
Don't let it beat you
Say 'nice to meet you' and 'bye'

Once you dig in
You'll find it coming out the other side
And once you dig in
You'll find you'll have yourself a good time
