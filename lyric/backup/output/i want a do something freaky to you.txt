I want'a do something freaky to you
Baby
Oh, baby
I want'a
Right now
Oh, baby

Your love is like a mountain
I'd love to slide down into your canyons
(Slide down)
In the valley of love
(In the valley of love)
I won't rest
(I won't rest)
Until I bring joy and happiness
(Ah)

I want'a do something freaky to you
Baby
(Something freakish to me)
Oh, baby
Oh
I want'a
(Something freakish to me)
Baby

All prepostitons of the Zodiac signs
I won't quit until I blow your mind
(Blow my mind)
