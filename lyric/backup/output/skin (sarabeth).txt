Sarabeth is scared to death
To hear what the doctor will say
She hasn't been well, since the day that she fell
And the bruise, it just won't go away

So she sits and she waits with her mother and dad
And flips through an old magazine
Till the nurse with the smile stands in the door
And says "Will you please come with me?"

Sarabeth is scared to death
'cause the doctor just told her the news
"Between the red cells and white, something's not right
But we're gonna take care of you
