Take a minute girl, come sit down and tell us what's been happening
In your face I can see the pain, don't you try to convince us that you're happy
We've seen this all before, but he's taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone

You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm telling you
Girl, I can tell you've been crying and you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying and pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding, don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you

I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love you
See, what y'all don't know about him is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job and I ain't making it easy
