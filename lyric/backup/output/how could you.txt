All I can do is sit alone
In my room, baby thinking about you
How could this be
That you are not here with me
When I gave you the best of me

I face each day, each day
Without a smile and life seems so unfair
I feel like I wanna die
'Cause you didn't even give me a last
You didn't give me a last goodbye, baby

I've waited weeks for your call
I've waited here by the phone
But when the silence grew long
I knew that something was wrong

Right then I knew it, babe
How could you do it, babe?
How could you tear my poor heart in two?
