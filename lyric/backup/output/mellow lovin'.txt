Hey, mister, please
Spare me some time, I'm lonely
My heart is crying, help me
Hey, mister, please, help me
I need something inside

Hey, mister, please
Please be the one who can give
One gentle touch or maybe
One gentle kiss, please, please
I need it desparately

Cause I've been giving
And giving and giving
And never getting no results
I'm tired of searching
And searching and searching
Please be the one to see what I need

Give me some mellow loving
That's what I need from you
