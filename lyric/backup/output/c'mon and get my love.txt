Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
C'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love, it's for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Break it down

So many times I've been around you
I don't know how much I like you
It's like a dream each time I see you
And there's this magic in the air

I feel so shy that I can't approach you
Even though you're just there
But I know that one day
I'll get my way
And this is what I'll say

C'mon and get my love
C'mon and get my love, it's for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
C'mon and get my love
