(feat. Da Brat, JD)

It's scary, I'm Miss Up's to da area
So So Def, next to Jay D
This funkdafide baby keep 'em crazy
My mentality happen to be livin' lavish
With formalities of having the fat shit
My status is impeccable
We wreckin' yo crew, the casualty is you
Jagged Edge coming through
Remember who
Hit it, did it something like a thousand times
Can't stop, can't quit
Gotta, gotta get mine
Get yours
I catch you off guard
Keep yo dick hard
Follow the yellow bitch
To the road to riches
And if the smoke thickens
It's to be the beat
