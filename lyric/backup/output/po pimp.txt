Do you wanna ride
In the backseat of a Caddy?
Chop it up with Do or Die

It was seven double-oh P.M
Fly low to them hoes in the B-M
Sipping Seagram, chewing on a weed stem
Touching on my fo' fif
Move it to the back so I can see who beeping this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
Three-line connection
As the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And, plus, we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
Cause I forgot where I met the ho
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the ho, really doe
To the crib

Seven deuce five, I ride the point to spot the live hoes
Three miles per hour
Like we running up on some rivals
Never to deny though, these bitches look fly, 'Lo
Introduce myself
