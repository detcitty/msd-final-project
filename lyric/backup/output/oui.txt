Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh.

I think about all the time
Think you may need all of mine
Hate to say you know that love is blind
I'm 'bout to see, I'll close my eyes
(Truth is) They can't see you in here though
Most of them need dollar signs to make
Every day your birthday

And every night your Valentineâ€¦
If we tried that we could be
Somewhere the climate is warm, long as you around me
I swear that everything will be just fine
I wish that we could take some time
