Pick up on the fact
Take in stride
Love and devotion
Don't confide
It's the tracks of lost emotion
Let it glide
It's gonna subside she stole my heart loved her from the start

Watcha gonna do
When I think I'm in love
And I catch my girl doin me wrong
Too bad
It's just enough to slip back in the start
