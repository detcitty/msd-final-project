I have never seen you down,
So outta touch and turned around
Oh, baby, won't you let me bring you up?

I've been wanting so to know you
Just give me the chance to show you
Baby, baby, let me bring you up.

Let me fill your cup up,
Let me bring you up up.

Oh there's some kind of love I wanna bring you
And there's some kind of song I wanna sing you
