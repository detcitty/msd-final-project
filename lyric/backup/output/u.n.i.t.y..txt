Instinct leads me to another flow
everytime i hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
trying to make a sister feel low
you know all of that gots to go
now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
but don't you be calling out my name
i bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
that's why i'm talking, one day i was walking down the block
i had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
i walked past these dudes when they passed me
one of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
i turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
then the little one said (yeah me bitch) and laughed
since he was with his boys he tried to break fly
