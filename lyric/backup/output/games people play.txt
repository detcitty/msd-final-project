Where do we go from here
Now that all other children are growin' up
And how do we spend our lives
If there's no one to lend us a hand

I don't wanna live here no more
I don't wanna stay
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life
Quietly fading away

Games people play
You take it or you leave it
Things that they say
Honor Brite
