Oh, rock me

Oh, knock me
Oh, rock me
Oh, knock me
Oh, rock me

Oh, knock me
Oh, rock me
Oh, knock me
Oh, rock me

Knock me
Knock me
Knock me
Knock me

Is he looking at me?
'Cause I'm looking at him
Is he looking at me?

I was in love the moment
That I saw you
I followed you through the crowd
And I almost lost you

I was dying to tell you
But scared of your reaction
But I can't hold back
