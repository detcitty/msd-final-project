Hey what's happ'nin' homie? This ya lil' whoa Plies man
I ran across a nice lil' baby the other day homie
Lil' mama so bad she had me hypnotized cuz
Couldn't even get my eyes off her
I'mma tell you how it feel to be hypnotized

You got me so hypnotized, the way yo' body rollin' 'round and round
That booty keep bumpin', titties just bouncin', up and down
You got me so hypnotized, the way yo' body rollin' 'round and round
That booty keep bumpin', titties just bouncin', up and down

It's two o'clock in the mo'nin'
I'm 'gnaced up and I'm ho'ny
All I need now is some moanin'
That pussy got me zonin'
Her vibe tell me she want it
She got to fuck how she on me
I got her now cause she jonin'
I know in the panties she foamin'
I locked eyes on that monkey
I know she wet cause she told me
That ass on her she pokin'
