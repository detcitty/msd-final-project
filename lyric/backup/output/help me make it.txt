Met the girl that I want to get to know a little better
Tonight I'm gonna take her to the picture show
Gonna park in the darkest spot I know
I got a question
That I never asked anybody else before

Hey would you help me make it to my rockin' chair
Love me all of my life
Don't wanna grow old without ya
Don't wanna be out in the cold without ya
No more

Help me make it to my rockin' chair
