Every day I sit beside you
On the bus to Madison Avenue
Work in the big gray store
With the revolving doors

You don't even know my name
I guess that I'm to blame
Don't know the right things to say
So I pretend away

That I'm Rudolph Valentino
Pull up in my limousine
Oh, won't you come in out of the rain
Things'll never be the same
