I will build you a castle with a tower so high
It reaches the moon
I'll gather melodies from the birdies that fly
And compose you a tune

Give you lovin'
Warm as mama's oven
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new, hey, baby

I will take you away with me as far as I can
To Venus or Mars
There we will love with your hand in my hand
