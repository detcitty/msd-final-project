Bust it

Slow love (Damn, that sound good)
Makin' slow love
Makin' slow love
Makin' slow love
Makin' slow love

Slow love
Makin' slow love
Makin' slow love
Slow love
Makin' slow love
Makin' slow love
Let's make slow love

Girl, I can hardly wait till we're alone in my room
You bring the blanket, I'll bring the boom
I know the night is young, but that's just as well
'Cause by the time we're through the night it'll be old as hell
Turn of the TV, we'll be doin' it from dawn to dusk
The couple on the screen ain't got nothin' on us
We'll make love in slow motion like we're suspended in time
Erotic movements 'cause our bodies do become intertwined
Tell me, girl, are you ready for lust
Tonight I plan on givin' you the maximum thrust
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
Word 'em up, Cool J, man, I know just how you feel
I'm aroused by your every touch
The very sound of your voice gets my gander up
It seems the longer we do it, it only gets better
So I'mma blow Keith Sweat, and make it last forever

Slow love
Makin' slow love (We can take, we can take our time)
(Let's not rush this thing) Let's make slow love
Slow love
