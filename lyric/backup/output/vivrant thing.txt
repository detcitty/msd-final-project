Uh, check it out now
Uh, no doubt now
Uh, yo, check it out now
Uh, no doubt, yo

Special girl, real good girl
Biggest thing in my itty bitty world
Called her up and she made me feel right
Wish bliss could never take flight
Sittin back with this mic in my hand
Spittin hot shit tryin to see grand
Imprinted on my mind every minute
Make my plans and you always in it, yo

(Chorus)
