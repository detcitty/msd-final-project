Forever and always
When I die, I'll keep on living for you
You give me strength when I start to worry
You lift me up when I'm feeling sorry

You're building me up with love and affection
When I'm in danger, you're my protection
And I'm the one you can depend upon
I'll always treat you right, never do you wrong

Just feel the love burning inside of me
It's gonna last for eternity
