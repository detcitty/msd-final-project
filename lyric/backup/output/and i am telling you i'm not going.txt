And I am telling you

I'm not going
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I can ever go
No, no, there's no way
No, no, no, no way I'm living without you
I'm not living without you
I don't wanna be free
I'm staying, I'm staying
And you, and you
You're gonna love me

You're gonna love me

And I am telling you I'm not going

Even though the rough times are showing
