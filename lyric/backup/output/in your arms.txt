Everything ain't what it seems
In this world of broken dreams
And the things they try to teach you
Sure ain't what you've seen
But you make it all seem right
When you whisper in the night
Won't you wrap those calming arms around me?
Hold me tight
Hold me near through the years
Through the fears, through the tears

Well it makes you wanna shout
With the crap they're dishin' out
You're the only one it seems
To make it all work out
And you're always by my side
Puttin' up with foolish pride
When the day to day fiascos
Only multiply
You're the heart, you're the soul
When the world takes it's toll

The load is getting lighter
When I'm in your arms
Just squeeze a little tighter
