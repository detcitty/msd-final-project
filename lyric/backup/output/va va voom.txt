Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could come inside of my play pen
Cause he look like a superstar in the makin'
So I think that I'm going in for the takin'

Hear through the grapevine that he cakin'
We could shoot a movie, he could the tapin'
Boom boom pow, this thing be shakin'
I ain't even tryin' to find out who he datin'

Cause I know that he got a wife at home
But I need just one night alone
If you keep playing them kidding games
I'm a runaway-eh, I'm a runaway-eh-eh

I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If-if you're looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance
