Wake up, little darling
It's time to go home
If sunrise catch us sleeping
We'll be caught up in the wrong

Last time we were together
You made it home in just the nick of time
We've got so much love between us
It's getting hard to meet the deadline

We're getting careless with our love
We're getting careless with our love
So, careless with our love affair

Wake up, little darling
Because time, it won`t stand still
Going home to someone you don't love no more
I know it's against your will

I hate to see you leave
With tears all over your face
