I've been standin' here, for oh so long
Tryin' to figure out girl, where we went wrong
Standin' here, on the edge of time
Waitin' for you baby, I might change your mind

But maybe I'm a fool, still lovin' you
Oh and maybe I'm wrong, for still hangin' on

'Cause you and me took the love so far
Had a beautiful thing that somehow went wrong
A whole lotta laughs have turned into tears
