Baby you
turned my world into something new
nights are long when you're far away
hunger for you every night and day
whisper softly to the wind
need you back in my arms again
passion calls from deep inside
it only happens when my love cries

You make my heart sing (x3)
when love cries
you make my heart sing (x3)
when love cries... love cries... love cries

And when I am blue
close my eyes and dream of you
silent echoes scream out your name
