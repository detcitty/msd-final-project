You like the way that sounds?

Little Jimmy Jackson is jackin? up his Bronco
He? s gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
All the girls are getting pretty sprayin? on the White Rain
Yeah, they? re gonna get a rowdy tonight
Down at the football game, yeah

We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild, yeah, but that? s the way
We get down in a Hicktown

Well, you can see the neighbors butt crack nailing on his shingles
And his woman? s smokin?, Pall Mall? s watchin? Laura Ingalls
And granny? s getting lit, she? s headin? out to bingo
Yeah, my buddies and me are goin? muddin?
