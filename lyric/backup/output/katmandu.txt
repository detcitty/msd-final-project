I think I'm going to Katmandu
That's really, really
Where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
That's what I'm gonna do

K-K-K-K-K-K-Katmandu
I think that's where I'm going to
If I ever get out of here
I'm going to Katmandu

I got no kick
Against the west coast
Warner Brothers
Are such good hosts

I raise my whiskey glass
And give them a toast
I'm sure they know it's true
I got no rap against
The Southern states
Every time I've been there
It's been great

But now I'm leaving
And I can't be late
And to myself be true

That's why I'm
