You know I love music
And every time I hear something hot
It makes me wanna move
It makes me wanna have fun
But it's something about this joint right here
This joint right here, it makes me wanna, woo!
Let it go

Can't let this thing called love get away from you
Feel free right now, go do what you wanna do
Can't let nobody take it away from you, from me, from we
No time for moping around, are you kidding?
And no time for negative vibes 'cause I'm winning
It's been a long week, I put in my hardest
Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right
So I like what I see when I'm looking at me

When I'm walking past the mirror
Don't stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it
Got my head on straight, I got my vibe right
I ain't gonna let you kill it
See I wouldn't change my life, my life's just fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh!
