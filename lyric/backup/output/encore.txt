Ooh, yeah

Your love (Yours) so good (Good Love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an Encore)

Your love (Yours) so good (Good Love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an Encore)

Your love (Yours) so good (Good Love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an Encore)

Your love (Yours) so good (Good Love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an Encore)

Going to a show tonight
After working hard 9 to 5
Not talking 'bout a movie, no
Or a Broadway play, this show is live

And I know it's you I wanna see tonight
Wanna see you tonight
I'll buy my ticket at the door if it's alright
So your show can make me feel good again

Your love (Yours) so good (Good Love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an Encore)
Your love (Yours) so good (Good Love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an Encore)
Your love (Yours) so good (Good Love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an Encore)
Your love (Yours) so good (Good Love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an Encore)

I can give you rave reviews
You sold out my heart with love
And every time that I'm with you
Boy, you take control, I'm your captive audience
