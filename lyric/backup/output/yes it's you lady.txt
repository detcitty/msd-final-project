Love is five foot somethin' with flashin' eyes
Irresistible merchandise
Love is walkin' towards me with open arms
Settin' off my desire alarm

Yes, it's you lady, love is you lady, hey
Yes, it's you who can do the same old things
And make me feel good every time

Fun is magic moments for two, it seems
Sharin' intimate secret dreams
Fun is ten more seconds of touchin'
We never seem to get too much and
