I ride for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s
I slide for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s dawg

Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s
Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s

Damn, life so short, f-ck it, I don't wanna go to court
F-ck it, got a budget for the lawyer though
F-ck it, I'm on the run for the money
I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil' nigg-s thuggin', even got me paranoid
I'm gettin' money, that's in any n-gga category
Double M I got G's out in California

I ride for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s
I slide for my nigg-s dawg, I ride for my nigg-s dawg

Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s
Stay schemin'
Nigg-s tryna get at me
I ride for my nigg-s
