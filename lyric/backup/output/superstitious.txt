Keep on walkin' that road and I'll follow
Keep on callin' my name, I'll be there
And if a mirror should break, it's easy to take
Deep down I know that you care
Well, I'm not superstitious, no, ooh

I'm not superstitious, I have no doubt
That there's a reason, how things turn out
While things are changin' from day to day
Well, I'll keep this feelin' with me all the way
