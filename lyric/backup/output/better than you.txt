Hey baby Its you I truly adore 
I finally found the peace of never wanting more 
Singin a sweet song of who and where I belong 
I see a vision of a love thats more than strong 
I feel so fine, truly divine 
My dream has come to life, hey yeah 
Youre always there on my mind 

Cause when I need two arms that can hold me tight 
A tender loving kiss that can make it right 
Someone to chase the darkness into the light
