Your body
My body, your body
(All over your body baby)
My body, your body
My body, your body
(All over my body girl)
My body, your body
All over my body girl
My body, your body
(All over your body, baby)
My body, your body
My body, your body
(All over my body)
My body, your body
My body, your body
All over my body girl
In the middle of the night
When my body's feenin' for you, baby
Gotta call you up and let you know
It's what I'm feelin', baby
Nine one one zero zero twenty-four
Baby it's an emergency
I'm callin' cuz gotta have some more
How would you like if I lay you down
(If I lay you down)
Would you like it if I was to sex you down
I can't think about nothing else
You sentulate me with your love
It ain't no secret girl
