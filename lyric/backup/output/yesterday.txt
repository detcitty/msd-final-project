Who's gonna love me, babe
who's gonna hold me now
kiss me tenderly
and rub my body down
make love by candlelight
keep me warm at night
i can't believe all you left me was memories
as i lay here, babe
wishing you here with me
that you were touching me
making my body scream
how could you leave me there with all these memories
so tell me what the hell am i supposed to be feeling now
Baby you're so fine
you're always on my mind
i think about you all the time
