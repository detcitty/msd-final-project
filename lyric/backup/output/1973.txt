Simona
You're getting older
Your journey's been
Etched on your skin

Simona
Wish I had known that
What seemed so strong
Has been and gone

I would call you up every Saturday night
And we both stay out till the morning light
And we sang, "Here we go again"
And though time goes by
I will always be
In a club with you
