I'm a guy with a heart of gold
The ways of a gentleman I've been told
The kind of guy who'd never harm a flea

Me and a certain character met
Man who invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in first degree

It ain't 'cause I don't smoke myself
And I don't figure it'll ruin my health
I've been smoking 'em all my life, ain't dead yet

But nicotine slaves are all the same
And pettin', party or a poker game
Every thing's gotta stop while I smoke that cigarette

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you puff yourself to death
Tell Saint Peter at the golden gate
Lord, you hate to make him wait
You gotta have another cigarette
