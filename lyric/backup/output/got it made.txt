Know you are a friend of mine, babe you been gone
an awful long time. You might remember me, I tried
to set your soul free.

Glad that you got it made, when did you finalize your last trade?
You are the only one I've ever seen do what you done

Anything that you done done, you are the only one
Don't put me under your gun.

I'm gonna be missing you, even though I understand that you're not through.
Go on take it day by day, seems like I lost you anyway.
