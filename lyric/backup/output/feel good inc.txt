City's breakin' down on a camel's back
City's breakin' down on a camel's back

City's breakin' down on a camel's back
City's breakin' down
City's breakin' down
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand

Take it all in on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever you and me

Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?
