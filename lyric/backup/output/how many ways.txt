Must have been heaven sent to me
Cause I never knew love like this
You know you make me feel
So good inside and boy,
It's a feeling I just can't hide
And baby words can't expree my gratitude
For each and every little thing you do
I want to understand
You're all the man
That I love and I know
That I need and I want and more
