Worked all week
Cleaned up, clean cut, and clean shaved
I got the cover off a '68
Fire it up, and let them horses sing

A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She's a rockin' them holey jeans
Baby, what you got goin' on Saturday?

You know, word's got it, there's gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four-wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine
