(Gary Moore)

M-hm.


When I'm close to you, I feel my heartbeat
telling me that you're the one for me.
Darling, I don't understand the reasons.
I just know that this was meant to be.


And when I look into your eyes I see it,
everything that I've been searchin' for.
Darlin', I don't understand this feeling,
I just know it's growing more and more.
