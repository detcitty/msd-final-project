Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I've never seem to get a lot

Take a jumbo across the water
Like to see America
See the girls in California
I'm hopin', it's going to come true
But there's not a lot, I can do

Could we have kippers for breakfast
Mummy dear, Mummy dear
