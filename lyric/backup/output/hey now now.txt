On the inside
Do you know what you're about
When I see you
I wanna free you
'Cause you're always freaking out

We could be riding on the waves of the ocean, baby
Flying to the beat of our hearts
I wanna make you a star

Hey Now Now
Don't you know
It's not really that complicated
Hey Now Now
When you come and go
It's so hard for me to sleep at night

Hey Now Now
Listen you
