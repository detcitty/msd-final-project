Whoa, whoa, whoa, ow!
There she stood in-house the street
Smiling from her head to her feet
I said hey what is this

Now baby maybe, maybe she's in need of a kiss

I said a hey what's your name baby

Maybe we can see things the same.
Now don't you wait or hesitate

Let's move before they raise the parking rate, ow!
All right now, baby it's-a all right now

All right now, baby it's-a all right now
