I lay beside you in the warmth of the night.
I can fell you breathe, I can hear you sigh, so softly.
Tell me now baby, this feeling won't change.
That it's a lasting love, not a passing phase, darling
I need to know I can depend on you.
I need someone who's gonna see me through.

Chorus:
(Baby be there)
There when I need you,
Tell me you care,
Make me believe you.
Promise you will stay by my side.
Through the good times, through the bad times.
