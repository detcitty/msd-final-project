Two o'clock this morning (morning)
If she should come a-calling Calling)
I couldn't dream of turning her away

And if it got hot and hectic (hectic)
I know she'd be electric (electric)
I'd let her take her chances with me
You see, she gets what she wants

'Cause she's heart and soul
She's hot and cold
She's got it all, hot loving every night
