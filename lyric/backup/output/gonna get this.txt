I think we got something
It's my girl Hannah
And Iyaz on the track right now
Let's go!

Tonight
We gonna get this
Tonight
We gonna get this
Tonight
We gonna get this
We gonna get this
We gonna get this

I can hear you cranking up them speakers
I don't really wanna show up any lata
Because soon we gonna party like it's new Year's

(Oh oh)
(Oh oh)

Yo I'm loving all the music that they're playing
But i ain't hearing anything you saying
Tonight we gonna get this
Gonna live exquisite
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh)

Somebody dance beside me
