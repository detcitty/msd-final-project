It's The Best Disco In Town, number one in disco sound 
 It's the place where hip people meet, hey, hey 
 It's The Best Disco In Town, bump and boogie all around 
 It's no place to sit in your seat, hey, hey 
 
 DJ's are the best there, you'll never get a rest there 
 You may meet the right girl or guy 
 When they play the right groove your body makes the next move 
 Get up on the floor and get down to see that the music can take you high 
 
 It's The Best Disco In Town, funky music pound for pound 
 Join the crowd, come on dance and sing, hey, hey 
 It's The Best Disco In Town, people come from miles around 
 It's the place to do your own thing, hey, hey 
 
 People dress the best there, the music is the best there 
 They're the very best sounds, so high class 
 If you make a request the DJ will do his best 
 To lay down your favorite song so you or baby hold on the past 
 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
