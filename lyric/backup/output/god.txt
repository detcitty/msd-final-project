God sometimes you just don't come through
God sometimes you just don't come through
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God sometimes you just don't come through

You make pretty daisies, pretty daisies, love
(Come down and tell me what you mean now)
I got to find, find, find what you're doing about things here
(Inside, inside, what you doing?)
