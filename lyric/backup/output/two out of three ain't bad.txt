Maybe we can talk all night,
but that ain't getting us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can,
there's nothin' left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night,
but that'll never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside,
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out,
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long,
I'm cryin' icicles instead of tears
And all I can do, is keep on tellin' you
