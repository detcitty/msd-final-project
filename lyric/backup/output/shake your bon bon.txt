Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon

I'm a desperado underneath your window
I see your silhouette
Are you my Juliet?
I feel a mad connection with your body

Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon

I wanna be your lover
Your only Latin lover
We'll go around the world in a day
Don't say no, no, shake it my way

Oh, shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon

You're a Mata Hari
I wanna know your story
In the Sahara sun I wanna be the one
