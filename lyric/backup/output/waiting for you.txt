everyday, a shade of blue
you won't believe, what i'm goin through
it just feels like i can't afford to let myself go
oh oh, nooo

everyone, is just the same
they touch me, but i can't say

there has been no one brighter than you
i can't deny these things that i do
feels like the world's at stake 'cause
