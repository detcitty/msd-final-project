See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby I don't know why ya treat me so bad
You said you loved me, no one above me
And I was all you had
And though my heart is beating for ya
I can't stop crying
I don't know how

I allow you to treat me this way and still I stay

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurtin' while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
