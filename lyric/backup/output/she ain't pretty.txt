I had two jobs, I had dishwater hands
And on the weekend in a rock and roll band
One Friday night, in my hometown bar
In walked a girl who looked like a movie star
She stared at me and it was turning me on
She said she worked in a beauty salon
I heard a voice inside me say
She ain't pretty, she just looks that way
