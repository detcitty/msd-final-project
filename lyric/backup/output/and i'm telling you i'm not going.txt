And I am tellin' you I'm not goin'
You're the best man I've ever known
There's no way I can ever go
No, no, there's no way
No, no, no, no, way

I'm not livin' without you
I'm not livin' without you
I don't wanna be free
I'm stayin', I'm stayin'
And you, and you, and you
You're gonna love me

And I am tellin' you, I'm not goin'
Even though the rough times are showin'
There's just no way
There's no way
