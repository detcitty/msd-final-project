Where do they get off telling you
that I am not the least bit into
Just tell me how the hell the can tell you they know what's in my heart
What do they get from telling you
that I don't give a damn about you
Just tell me why the hell somebody wants to tear your heart apart

Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why do them people have to tell you lies
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I love you more than words could ever show
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't explain
Why do some people have to be that way
I can't take much more, I can't ignore
I have to let you know what's in my heart

If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl, I'm saying I do
You can know that from this moment you are always in my heart
