Have you ever seen the sky
So beautiful, colorful, wide and wonderful?
Have you ever felt the sun shine
So brilliantly, raining down, over you and me?
Have you ever wanted more? Wanted more

You've got to keep your mind wide open
All the possibilities
You've got to live with your eyes open
Believe in what you see
