You've a certain sartorial eloquence
And a style that's almost all your own
You've got the knack of being so laid back...
It's like talking to the great unknown.

You've got a self-sufficient swept-back hair-do
Pretty certain that you've got it made...
Oh, your lifestyle shows in the clothes you chose
Sitting pretty in the masquerade...

Singing, don't you wanna play this game no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
Don't you wanna play this game no more?
Don't you wanna play no more?
