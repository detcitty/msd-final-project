I'm not the one, that you'll be shootin' for
I'm not the one, who's coming back for more
(You know why)
We've been through this to many times
(You know why)
It's never clear, it's pantomime

Goin' round and round 'cause you can't get on your feet
Goin' round and round, still takin' all the heat
Goin' round and round, never lettin' down
