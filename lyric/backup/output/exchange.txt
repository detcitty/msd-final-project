This what happen when I think about you
I get in my feelings, yeah
I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my play of ways got way to complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go, they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say that way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so

So gimme all of you in exchange for me
