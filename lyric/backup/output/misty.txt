Misty
Ray Stevens
(Erroll Garner/Johnny Burke)

Covered many times, this song has had at least
four top 40 appearances, with one of the best-known
by Johnny Mathis in 1959. Ray's "country-fied" version
peaked at #14 in 1975, and gave him his second Grammy.

Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
Ah, I'm walkin' on a cloud
