Peace Will Come (According To Plan) 
 Melanie 
 
 There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one 
 There's a chance peace will come in your life please buy one 
 
 For sometimes when I am feeling as big as the land 
 With the velvet hill in the small of my back 
 And my hands are playing the sand
