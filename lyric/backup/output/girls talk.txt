There are some things you can't cover up with lipstick and powder
Thought I heard you mention my name, can't you talk any louder?
Don't come any closer, don't come any nearer
My vision of you can't come any clearer
Oh, I just wanna hear girls talk

Got a loaded imagination being fired by girls talk
It's a more or less situation inspired by girls talk
But I can't say the words you wanna hear
I suppose you're gonna have to play it by ear, right here, and now
