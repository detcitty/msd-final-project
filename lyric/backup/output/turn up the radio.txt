Turn it up!
Yeah!
I'm working hard, you're working too
We do it every day
For every minute I have to work
I need a minute of play
Day in day out all week long
Things go better with rock
The only time I turn it down
Is when I'm sleepin it off
Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimmie some more
Turn up the radio
