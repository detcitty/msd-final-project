...
Tell me, are you listening
Tell me, can you hear?
better get yourself together boy
oh, before I disappear
'cause I ain't gonna take it
take it anymore
I said I'd be your lover
never said I'd be... more
Do I have to sit and listen
to you tell me lies
The time has come
To break these ties

(You better listen)
You've got a lot to learn
You're gonna tumble
When I let you fall
(You better listen)
You're gonna feel the burn
And be a victim
Of your own desire
'Cause I'm gonna fight
Fire with fire
