We're the ones
With the runaway eyes
We're the ones
Who can improvise
Give us room
And a hot situation
We believe in
Positive stimulation

(We are the young)
We are the young
With the modern attitude
Breaking down the walls
Breaking all the rules

(We are the young)
Tomorrow comes
And we might go away
So we don't worry
'Bout the price we pay

We are the young
