Maybe I should take take picture off the dashboard
Before memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel
Yeah I bet she's still crying on that front porch
Yeah this time it's going to take some time to heal

Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing Georgia on my mind
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
That six string riding in the seat won't keep me warm tonight
