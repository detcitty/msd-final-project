Why do I keep my mind on you all the time?
And I don't even know you (I don't know you)
Why do I feel this way thinking about you every day?
And I don't even know you (I don't know you)
Take me in your arms
Thrill me with all of your charms

And I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more till the day I die
Take to the sky on a natural high
