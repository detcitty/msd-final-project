Ba ba ba ba... yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Just because of you (ooh, yeah)
I'm a happy guy
You're the reason why
Just because of you
I'm a happy guy
You're the reason why

I feel like a king
Sitting high on top of the world
If my heart could sing
I'd sing a love song to you, girl

You are my reason
To feel this way
