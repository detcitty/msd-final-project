It makes it easier, easier to bear

You won't regret it, no, no
No, girl they won't forget it
Love is their only
Happiness yeah
Sq-sq-sq-squeeze her, don't tease her
Never leave here

I invented swag
Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab, proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert, Hublot's
Or the big face Rollie I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back
See my cut through the holes
