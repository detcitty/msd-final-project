Don't lose the magic
Don't lose the magic

First time I laid my eyes on you
You were like a star in the night
Heaven must have sent your love
You were shining so bright

I was blinded by the passion
Want to feel your love tonight
I wanna go wherever you go
And I know love will follow

Oh, there's this magic in you
The way that you touch
Everything you do
My hearts keeps on telling me
This night will be full of ectasy
