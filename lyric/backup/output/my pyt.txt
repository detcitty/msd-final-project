She a couple couple, couple years younger
But she badder than a motherfucker
Ass fatter than a motherfucker
She got her own she don’t need no ticket
She get it yeah she got it so you know I’m going to get it
You my M-Y-P-Y-T
She my M-Y-P-Y-T
She my M-Y-P-Y-T
She my pretty young thing
And I’ll do anything for her
I want to love you
Pretty young thing
You need some loving
From a real one
I want to love you
Pretty young thing
You need some loving
And I’m a real one


I'm sayin' hold up what’s up what it do
I ain’t trying to do too much but come through
Cartier frames too much but it’s cool
The only thing strange they won’t get off you
Say you want a rider
Well I got a ticket
And later we can hide out
You trying to get Missing
Now I’m all up in your mind now
Cool , that’s how I get you
But you can’t figure mine out
See I’m quite different
A James Bond nigga with a Saint Laurent fetish
And thank god I never had a baby mother either
Snapchat shortie
Flash that for me
Clap back from niggas like that’s not for you
