She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fan base
A couple niggas with a suit case
Suit and tie niggas who play role play
When it comes to money she play no games

She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, till she

Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
