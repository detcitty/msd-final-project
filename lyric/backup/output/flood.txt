Rain rain on my face
Hasn't stopped raining for days
My world is a flood
Slowly I become one with the mud

But if I can't swim after forty days
And my mind is crushed by the crashing waves
Lift me up so high that I cannot fall
Lift me oh

Lift me up - When I'm falling
Lift me up - I'm weak and I'm dying
