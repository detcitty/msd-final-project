I'll be representing, representing
I'll be representing, representing
You represent for bad bitches all around the world
The way you put it down in between the sheets
Is like no other girl
You done take it a whole another level of freakiness
When you blow my mind
To the point where all the other women
Kinda feeling like you stole their shine
So I better come with it, then I better come spilt it
And I can admit that I'm feeling a little pressure
When you're telling me I better come get it
But I'm the man for the job
Can't nobody do it quite like I do
And the same go for you
We a match made in heaven
