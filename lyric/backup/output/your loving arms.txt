Burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside yeah
Oooh, burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside now yeah...

Yeah...

So many times have I asked you to tell me
That I'm your girl
Time after time I have needed a reason
Just to get inside your world
So many times have I asked you to ask me
How it feels to love
And when it's love seems the only conclusion
That I'm guilty of
Oh baby then you

Put your loving arms around me
And it feels like shelter when you
Put your loving arms around me
