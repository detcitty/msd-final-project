It's no funny hanging around
Winter seems so numbing
Getting fat where I sit down
Do you suppose it's old age coming

I get this feeling I'm no good for nothing
Life has led me wrong
Once in a while it makes it all worthwhile
If I can sing this song

I got to rock on I can't be this way
I'm hanging around but wait till music's in season
