Ow!
Ewwww, yeah!

'Cause you got it made,
Eww, you're somethin'.
Talk about how you got it all,
When you ain't got nothin'.

God you're hot,
Like a pleasure stone,
My body touch you,
You will find it on your own,
Some people won't you run to.

Don't know? and dream,
'Cause you don't know what it means,
'Til somebody loves you.

[Chorus:]
Eww, stars don't shine,
Your life, is wasted time,
'Til somebody needs you,
