Just before our love got lost you said
"I am as constant as a northern star"
And I said "Constantly in the darkness
Where the hell is that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar"

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh Canada
With your face sketched on it twice
Oh you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
