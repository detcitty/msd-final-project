If I could turn the page in time then I'd rearrange just a day or two
Close my close my close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way so I'll settle for one day to believe in you
Tell me tell me tell me lies
Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies

Tell me lies
Tell me tell me lies
Oh no-no you can't disguise
You can't disguise
