I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come on crashing in
Like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand

All that your love can bring
Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation

Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind
To tell you that I can't keep lovin' you, can't keep lovin' you
