You'll say, we've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from
And we're falling apart
You'll say, the world has come between us
Our lives have come between us
Still I know you just don't care

And I said what about Breakfast at Tiffany's?
She said I think I remember the film
And as I recall I think, we both kind of liked it
And I said well that's, the one thing we've got
