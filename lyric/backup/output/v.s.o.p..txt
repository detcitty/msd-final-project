Hit the lights - can't let no one see me get down;
It's alright, I know they think I get around...
You and I got something they can't know about;
Really, only heaven knows my heart...

You know this ain't an ordinary love;
We got so much history in the stories about us,
So come on over, baby...

We gon' light some candles tonight - very special...
We gon' do whatever you like - very special...
Got some Henny chillin' on ice - very special...
Hope you make the rest of my life very special...
