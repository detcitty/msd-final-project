Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky wont catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but
I'm kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya
I'm tryna see how deep you are
And believe me shawty I ain't talking about

no intimate conversation
I'm wanna see if I can make you reach things unattainable when I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals
Will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna give you whats better than better
The better my effort
the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or

Temporary forever's
Shawty get it together
Diced Pineapple
May your love come down some of mine might have you
You design my imagination
And let me redefine foreplay so you need five
Tell me shawty you got it baby

If it's not it baby
Hope its progress baby

Let it all drip baby

Stop that shaking
No more talking baby
No more talking baby
Shawty so fine
Pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples
there my baby taste the best
I nearly lost my mind
