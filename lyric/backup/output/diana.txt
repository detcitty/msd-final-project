Diana

The front pages are your pictures,
They make you look so small,
How could someone not miss you at all?

Oh-ah-oh

I never would mistreat ya,
Oh I'm not a criminal,
I speak a different language but I still hear your call.

Diana,
Let me be the one to light a fire inside those eyes,
You've been lonely,
You don't even know me,
But I can feel you crying,
Diana,
Let me be the one to lift your heart up and save your life,
