Da, da, da, da, da, da dangerous
Da, da, da, dan, da, dangerous
All my friends say he's much too hot
Don't get involved, it's emotional shock
But ooh, he charges my electricity
When he puts his finger on me
I said a oh, oh, oh, you know I want you and i
And i, and I need you pretty baby
I'm in the fire, there's just no turning back
Though I know, know, know
You're dangerous (ooh)
So hot and heavy, I know that I just can't resist
