Oh, I know you're surprised, girl
To see me knocking at your door
We had a little misunderstanding
I packed my bags and left and said
I wouldn't be back no more

I went straight to another woman
Who I thought wanted me
But when she found out I had lost you
She got cold as she could be

She said, as far as she was concerned
That, uh, we were through
And I might as well turn around
And go on back to you

So I'm standing here knocking, baby
(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)
Please, let me in

(Standing here knocking)
(Standing here knocking)
