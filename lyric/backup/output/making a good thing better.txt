(Peter Wingfield)

Although I know our love is going strong
Little surprises kind of help it along
We mustn't let our lives become routine
Don't do anything we don't mean

There is no limit on love at all
It can always get better the deeper you fall
I'm sure without that love we won't survive
So come on and show it; let's keep it alive
