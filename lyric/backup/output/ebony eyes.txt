Have you seen that girl on the corner
I'd like to take her out of her chains
Cause if I had my way with you baby
I would be changing your life today

Your eyes got me dreaming
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hoping
That I'll be holding close tonight

Your eyes got me dreaming
Your eyes got me blind
