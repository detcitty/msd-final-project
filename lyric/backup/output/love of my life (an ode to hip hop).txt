Right here what we gonna do is go back
Way back
Ooh...
Way back, yeah

I met him when I was a
A little girl, he gave
He gave me poetry
And he was my first

But in my heart I knew I
Wasn't the only one
'Cause when the tables turned
He had to break up

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice

But that is all behind me
'Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the

Love of my life
You are my friend (yea)
Love of my life
I can depend

Love of my life
