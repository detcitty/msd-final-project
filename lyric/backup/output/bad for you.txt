You bring a feeling to me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'mma good girl
But I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad

And they say bad girls ain't no good
Good girls ain't no fun
I still can't find a nigga that touch that, no one
And I ain't searching for it
Never trust but I'm working on it
Fell in love with that raw game
Swimming pool you surfing on it
Like 'yonce do the surfboard, surfboard
They still think you a church girl
We linking up on your days off
