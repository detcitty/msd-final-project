Dj turn the music
I wanna feel it

Three 6 mafia
Kingston
Tiesto

I say DJ turn the music up
And send another round going to my cup
I wanna Feel it (ohh ohh)
I wanna Feel it (ohh ohh)
Dj let the music drop
We going all night let the party rock
I wanna Feel It (ohh ohh)
I wanna Feel it (ohh ohh)

Im at the bar
Going have a bar
Sippin to the one
Stumbling to the car
But i dont wanna leave coz its too crunk
These girls got alot of junk in the trunk
Red bar, black bone, white top, mid tone
Gettin that back, and its on
Ima gigolo and its gone
A freak of the week
Tryna get a piece
