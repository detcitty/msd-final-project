Wooh
I Look At You
You Look At Me
(You Can't Help It Yeah We're Feeling Butterflies)
It's obvious
We got some Chemistry
(I think I know what it feels so right)
Now I wanted so long to know
Now You're telling me you gotta let it go
(Dont Tell Me I have to start all over again)
I Never thought this day would come
(This is something that I've wanted in my life)
I realize that you're the one
(and you're telling me it's time to say goodbye)
What's inside of my heart It ain't gonna change
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away
(You feel it I feel it Let's not pretend let's not pretend)

Maybe I Don't Know What Love Is
Maybe I'm A Fool
I Just Know What I'm Feeling
And It's All Because Of You
Don't Tell Me
I Don't Know
I Want The Truth
Cause They Call It
We Call It
