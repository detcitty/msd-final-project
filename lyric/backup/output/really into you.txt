Post my meaning

Here's an oldie but goodie

There's something bout the
Way you move that turns me on
Your sultry looks and boyish charms

Around the way is where
The boy that took my breath away

It seems to me, you want to be
The one to sweep me off my feet
You're so cute and, oh, so sweet, yeah

I'm really into you (oh, baby)
So what you been up to
(What you gonna do)
I'm really into you
So what you been up to
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm into you and all the things you do
So open up the doors to your heart
Oh, cause if I need to find love
I'll always thank the stars for you
