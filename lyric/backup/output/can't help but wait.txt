I can't help but wait
Ohh uh
Can't help but wait

I see you, you with him
He ain't right but you don't trip
You stand by while he lies
then turn right round and forgive

I can't take to see your face
With those tears runnin down your cheeks
But what can I do
I gotta stay true
Cause deep down I'm still a G

And I don't want to come between you and your man
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

Girl I can't help but wait
Till you get back with him it don't change
Can't help but wait
Till you see that with me it ain't the same
