Hey, yo, it's all love, but love's got a thin line
And Pun's got a big nine, respect crime but not when it reflect mine
The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long
Pull a fast one, then Pun'll wake up with the stash gone

I'm mad strong and my cream is fast
Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit'

Lace the click 'cause we all share
It's all fair like love and war, thug galore with the long hair
Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run
Like spelling murder, reverse it, deliver redrum

Come one, come all, if you wanna brawl
I'm the mighty Thor, clotheslining motherfuckers like Steven Segall
'Cause all you gonna get is your ass kicked or up in a casket
That's it, that's it
(That's it?)
