There's a man, 
On the corner, 
Raisin' a congregation, 
Sayin' that he's the one, 
Brothers and sisters, 
That's gonna bring us all salvation.

Sayin' that he's the one, 
To make a way for, 
He's gonna do it, 
With no hesitation.

Sayin' step! 
In the land, 
Can you spare a dime?

I heard him say, 
Step! 
Right on up.
How you this evenin'?
Drop a buck.

People I tell ya, 
What I've seen.
A?

Ain't much difference, 
In what he's doin', 
Good people, 
For?

That man is... 
(Stealin' in the name of the lord)
Sayin' God's gonna mess ya...
