Tell ya daddy stop his hating
Cuz I be wearing braids and rockin jerseys daily
But that dont mean im thuggin though
He dont want me with ya
But I aint tryna hear it though
Not tryna hear it though

But I know that if he knew ya
He would understand ya
Know that your my man and
you would never hurt me no
Let me come and see you
So that we can be alone, alone
(Baby I know a place that we can go and be alone)
As long as you make sure that you safely get me home
(Don't worry baby)

Meet me on the southside
Get you home by midnight
Make sure that your daddy just don't know (daddy just don't know)
I got you in the hood but
I know what I'm doin cause
That's where we'll be eating on the low (eating on the low)
Meet me on the southside
Baby we can go hide
Where I know my boys goin have my back (yeah-eeh-yeah)
Only on the southside girl (southside, eh-eeh-eh)
Southside
