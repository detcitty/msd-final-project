Well I'm the same old girl that I used to be
I haven't changed at all
Got the same old walk, the same old talk
That would run you up the wall
I got the same old face and the same old smile and
The same old baby blues
And I'm still doing the rhumba, baby
I'm still the girl for you

I'm still doing the rhumba baby
I can't seem to quit
If my mama catches us doing the rhumba
