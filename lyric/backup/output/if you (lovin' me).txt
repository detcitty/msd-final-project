Feeling like lovin' me

Been checking you for so long and I feel
Girl, you should let me know what the deal
Been peepin' out your vibe
Like you wanna let me slide
So what you need to do right now is keep it real

I know you want me, girl, just like I want you
So stop frontin' like you don't, when you do
So if you're feeling naughty, naughty
And if you're really 'bout it, 'bout it
And if you get me rowdy, rowdy
My love's gonna make you shout it, shout it

If you (If you're feelin' like lovin' me)
If you (If you're feelin' like kissin' me)
If you (If you're feelin' like lovin' me)
If you (Holdin' me) feelin' like lovin' me

If you (If you're feelin' like kissin' me)
If you (If you're feelin' like lovin' me)
If you (La-da-da-da-da)
If you feelin' like lovin' me

So on your lonely nights girl, I'm here for you
Let me come satisfy you for an hour or two
Baby, don't be shy 'cause I'm not judging you
I'm comin' for your love, so let me through

Girl, as I'm talkin' 'bout them things we could do
