Ooh baby, ooh yeah, it's Tender Love & Care
Tender love... Tender love
Hey there, where are you going?
I won't let you pass me by without knowing
Right now I'm hypnotized, just a little mesmerized
It's you you're the reason why
I spend my time thinking of the things we can do
I wanna share my loving
I spend my time thinking of the ways I will do
You know what T.L.C. coming from me
Everything's gonna be all right
Why don't you spend the night?
