Every time that you get undressed
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just looking at you, oh, oh
Yeah, the drums they swing low

And the trumpets they go
And the trumpets they go
Yeah, the trumpets they go

Da da, da ra-ra da
Da da, da ra-ra da
Da da, da ra-ra da
Da da, da ra-ra da
Da da, da ra-ra da
Da da, da ra-ra da
They go

Is it weird that I hear
Violins whenever you're gone (Whenever you're gone)
