This songs dedicated
To my homiez in that gangsta lean
Whyd you have 2 go so soon
It seems like yesterday
We were hangin round da hood
Now im gonna
Keep you memory alive
Like a homie should

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
Id like to keep steppin
But I cant get past the pain

I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink, and I
Stop to think, and I
I know one day soon
We'll be, we'll be hangin out

This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, that gangsta lean
This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, that gangsta lean
