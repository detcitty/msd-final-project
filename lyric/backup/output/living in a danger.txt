Live for yourself, it's a wonderful thing
You can do what you want
You can live in a dream
Get up, get in, get the rhythm, get down

You're living your life in peace and in harmony
You're making your own decisions
That's how it's got to be for you and me
So many people are running 'round and 'round
Without any sense of logic
I see lies

In the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies
In the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
I see lies
In the eyes of a stranger
Woah, you'll be living in danger
