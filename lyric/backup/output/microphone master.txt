I iggity am what I am, I comes to get biz so bust the jam
I might not be the man but y'all I still proceed to slam, I cram
to understand why these rappers try to faze me
They must be crazy messin' with the Books and Drayzie

Big-up to Jersey and my people's out in EL-A
Well-a hell-a can never cut the swell-a
'Cos you can tell I gets biz like Markie
No matter what the weather son you never wanna spark me

I'm kickin' rhymes and gettin' mines on the regular
See me in the black Benz just blowin' up the cellular
We high as shit, the sky is it?
You know the sewer style yo is fly as shit
So grip, you're cheap and buried cos you're never comin' near it
(What?)

So fear it when you hear it, cheer it but don't compare it
I still be schoolin', foolin' 'em when I'm speakin'
Kids be heapin', they love the way that we be freakin'
My sewer style it 'cause disaster so when I ask
You better answer who's the microphone master

Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker
Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker
Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker
Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker

Well yo, here's the humdinger
I'm briggity bringin' a new style of thing
