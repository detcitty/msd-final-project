You don't have to
Cry, cry, cry, cry alone
Cause I'll be right by
Your side to help you be strong

Baby, dry your eyes
Please be strong
I can pull these times
And help you hold on
I've been on standby
Waiting for your call
I'll catch any teardrop
Before one can fall
I'll never deceive you

The way others did
I've got what you need, girl
And so much to give
You don't have (Don't cry, lady

To cry-cry-cry-cry alone
I'll be right by your side
You've found a new home
Baby, dry your eyes, please
You've got to be strong
Just hold, hold on
There's someone here now
