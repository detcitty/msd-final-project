Have I never told you I love you?
Have I never told you I care?
Have I never told you how much I need you?
Have I ever, ever not being there?

If I never told you a care
Girl, I swear to you, it's not because the feeling's not there
I'll promise to you from the top of my soul
The bottom of my heart, girl, don't you know I love you then?
I love you now and will forever more

Have I never
(Ooh)
Told you I love you?
(Told)
Have I never told you the words
Baby, I love you, you know, I love you?
Just know that I love you

Have I ever told you I miss you?
Have I ever hurt your heart
Girl, I never ever meant to mistreat you
I could never knowingly break your heart

If I ever called you to feel
The words I speak straight from my heart are not very real
