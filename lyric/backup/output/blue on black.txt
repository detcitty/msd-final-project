Night falls and I'm alone
Skin chilled to the bone
You turned and you ran
Slipped right from my hands

Blue on Black
Tears on a river
Push on a shove
Don't mean much
Joker on Jack
Match on a fire
Cold on ice
A dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream
Doesn't change a thing
Don't bring you back
Blue on black
Oh yea
Blue on black
