Oh, I never, you know I loved you till you left me
Oh, I never, you know I cared till you were gone
I was young and foolish, I didn't know what I was doin'
I didn't know I lost you till you're gone
Oh, I never, knew I loved you till you were gone

So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

So I gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover
Gotta get up early in the morning
To find me another lover

Now I gotta get up early every morning
'Cause the early bird always catches the worm
Now I gotta get up every morning
Gotta make up for the lesson I've learned
Gotta find me a lover that won't run for cover
Gotta find me a lover that won't run the mother

'Cause I gotta get up early in the morning
