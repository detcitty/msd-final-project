OOooooo
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oohhhhhhh Yeah
Ummmm hmmmm

Guess you never know a good thing
When it's right in your face
you've been abused for so long
Love gets tainted and all seems the same
I guess it's unbelievable
Someone could love you like this
Well time ain't no object and money ain't a thing
When you have someone to ease your pain

Wanna be the smile on your face
Be your stars and your moon
I wanna be your sunny day
Can I be your favorite tune?
I wanna be your breakfast in bed
And baby I'll be your food
Mr. Too Damn Good To You
