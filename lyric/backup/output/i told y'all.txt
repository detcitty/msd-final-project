Petey Pablo

I told y'all
 (I told y'all)
Everybody happen y'all wouldn't listen to me
 (I told y'all)
Now you see it poppin' off, got you in the club dancing your ass off
 (I told y'all)
Break it down, break it down for me
(For me )
Break it down, break it down, break it down for me
(For me )
 (I told y'all)
Break it down for me
(For me )

If y'all ready get your lighter put your fire in the air
I'm bout to blow this up
 (Oh yeah)
Its a it's a on now
Petey Pab done and graduated
Broke a loose, shook em' off
Twisted the game
Train comin'

Full speed
Ain't nuthin' stopin' this muthafucker
Puttin' it down for my home town
 (Ti-ti-train)
For my home town
(My niggas keep picking me up)
I got em' rockin' at the show
All y'all muthafuckers stompin' on the floor
(Boom, boom)
Losing control
(Eyes closed)

Hands up
(Bobbin' the dome)
And you can call it what ya wanna if ya wanna
But you better keep your eyes on it
I'd a told ya over and over
I don't feel like talking no more
It's about to go down
(Yeah like I told ya)
