Yeah, ooh
Ooh, look at her

She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be, hey
She's a bad mama jama
Just as fine as she can be

Her body measurements
Are perfect in every dimension
She's got a figure that's
Sure enough getting attention

She's poetry in motion
A beautiful sight to see
I get so excited
Viewing her anatomy

(She's built) she's built
She's stacked (oh, she's stacked)
Got all the curves that men like
(She's got all the curves that men like)

(She's built) she's built
She's stacked (oh, she's stacked)
Got all the curves that men like
