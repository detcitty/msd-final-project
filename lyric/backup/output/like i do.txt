It's been three years and seven days
Since I first gave my all to you
Stuck up in love so wrong
I can't see nothin' else but me and you

A sudden change has come about
The way you treat me, I need you
Can't stop the rain from comin' down
Until you see it's true that

No one's gonna love you [Like I do it]
Late at night, baby [Like I do]
I get up early in the mornin' [To please you and], oh, yeah, yeah
And make sure that you're satisfied

[Don't run away from lovin']
[Love is] All I have for you
[Don't turn away from us]
