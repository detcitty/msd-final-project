Another night, its getting colder
Just when I thought that it was over
I realized, that I can't be denied
Your love, its taking me over
Many times I've tried to spend to many lies I've
forgiven you
You got your foolish pride and you know down deep inside I'm
breaking all the rules
What else can I do
