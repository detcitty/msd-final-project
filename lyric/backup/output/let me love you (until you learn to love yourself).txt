Much as you blame yourself,
You can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love that was even remotely real
How can you understand something that you never had?

Ooh, baby, if you let me, I can help you out with all of that
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
I know your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness gets brought to life

I'll take you there
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you, baby, oh
Girl let me love you
