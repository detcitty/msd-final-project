(feat. Ludacris)

(Chorus - Ludacris & (Shawnna))
Maannn, these bitches is awfully nasty
And these bitches keep walking past me
Either way, I'm a pimp for today
Put your bootie in the way and shake that shit!
(Now these niggaz is bout they bank)
(And these niggaz keep buying dranks)
(Lips creep from my body on your lips)
(Get it closer to the tip and shake that shit!)

(Verse 1 - Shawnna)
S-H-A to the W double N-A
Real bitch don't play
Your eyes can't hide what your lips won't say
You're acting like the Dukes of the Fifth won't spray
It's okay, they gon learn
Chi's most wanted bitch wait your turn!
Sac full of yum I'm a make that burn
Y'all can't smoke none anyway
Wild ones, walk wit a bitch through wild slums
