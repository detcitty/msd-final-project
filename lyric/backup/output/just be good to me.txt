Friends tell me I am crazy
And I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
It's not the way I see it
‘Cause I feel you're already mine
Whenever you're with me (Ooh... ooh... ooh...)

People always talkin' ‘bout
Your reputation
I don't care about your other girls
Just be good to me (Ooh... ooh... ooh...)

Friends are always tellin' me
You're a user
I don't care what you do to them
Just be good to me (Ooh... ooh... ooh...)

You may have many others
But I know when you're with me
You are all mine
Friends always seem to listen
To the bad things that you do
You never do them to me (Ooh... ooh... ooh...)

People always talkin' ‘bout
