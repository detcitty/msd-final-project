Down for yours if you're down for mine
Ooooooo...
Nastyboy klick, I would die for you
Down for yours if you're down for mine
Ooooooo...
Nastyboy klick, are you down for your dj?
Down for yourz if you're down for mine
I'll be that man dropping skill
Give your body chills
Let me wine and dine you boo
No doubt that I'll be good to you
I like a girl that always gots my back
Whenever I need her she'll be standing where i'm at
If you down to represent
And put your trust in me
Ain't scared of no guns
And let me run the street
Let me do what I gotta do
And show you I'm fine, love you blind
It's just that hook-ups take time
And got to have ends or a place to live
Smoking fat phillys
I'm still down wit you kid
So if you want it, come and get it, don't take too long
Cause in the valley of az
Finding flat females ain't hard
So come and take a ride
And if you swing to this bounce
Room 6-0-duece
That's what I'm all about
Fulfill your fantasies
And all of your desires
Lay back, pop the top up
And let me take you higher

Loving you this way, I'll never lead you astray
I knew you want to be og, when you put your trust in me
Down for yours if your down for mine (put your trust in me)
I'm down for yours, if your down with my flow, keep it going
I'm always down for my g's
Down for yours if you're down for mine
Now all I need is a shorty with a mac like that
Victoria secret, champagne, and bubble baths
