When I'm lost in a strange place
Scared and alone
When I'm wishing for home
That's when I think of you
When the load gets too heavy
Too much to bear
When I'm going nowhere and there's no-one there
And I'm feeling like a fool

That's when I think of you
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you
