Toe to toe
Dancing very close
Barely breathing
Almost comatose
Wall to wall,
People hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face
Sadly solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty-four hour shopping in rapture

Fab Five Freddie told me everybody's fly
DJ's spinnin' are savin' my mind
Flash is fast,
Flash is cool
Francois sais pas, flashe' no do
