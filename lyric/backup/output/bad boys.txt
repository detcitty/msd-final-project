Woo-woo
Dear mummy, Dear Daddy,
You had plans for me, I was your only son.
And long before this baby boy could count to three,

You knew just what he would become.

Run along to school,
No child of mine grows up a fool,
Run along to school.

When you tried to tell me what to do,
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you,
One thing that I know for sure-
