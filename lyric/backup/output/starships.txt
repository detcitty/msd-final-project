Let's go to the beach, each, let's go get a wave
They say, what they gonna say?
Have a drink, clink, found the Bud Light
Bad bitches like me, is hard to come by

The Patr√≥n, own, let's go get it on
The zone, own, yes I'm in the zone
Is it two, three, leave a good tip
I'ma blow all my money and don't give two shits

I'm on the floor, floor, I love to dance
So give me more, more 'til I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor like it's your last chance
If you want more, more then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
