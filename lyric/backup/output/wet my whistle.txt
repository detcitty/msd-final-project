Wet my whistle
Wet my whistle

Just like sweet wine, baby
Your love's intoxicatin'
Why'd I have to waste it (Mmm?)
It was much too good to waste it

So, baby, let me love you
I'll place no one above you

? Cause I'm hooked baby, on your love
Just because

I just had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips, girl, I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit, baby, was much too much
