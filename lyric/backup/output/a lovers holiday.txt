Not a cloud showed out in the sky
That very night in Pitch Black City
I was so damned scared, it was dark
It was so dim, it was a shame
Just then a man walked up to me and said
Didn't I see you here before
The lights were low and the party was so dull
Just not good enough

Holiday (Ey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Holiday (Holiday, what you say)
Holiday
Celebrate (Ah yeah)
