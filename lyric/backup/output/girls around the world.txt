All around the world, girls, all around the world
This goes out to girls all around the world

(I just want to be your man, girl)
(So uh, gotta make you understand girl)
It's the way you flip your hair and those stylish clothes you wear
When you walk into the room all my partners stopped and stared at you

(All around the world, girls, all around the world)
(This goes out to girls all around the world)
But they just been the usual
(All around the world, this goes out to girls all around the world)
It's the tattoo on your back and that brand new Louie bag
With them matchin' high heels, I can't help this girls swag's the truth

(All around the world, girls, all around the world)
(This goes out to girls all around the world)
And I just want to give her love, oh
(All around the world, this goes out to girls all around the world)

(Girl, I)
Can't get you off my mind, you're like my favorite song
(Song)
Just want to turn you on and work you all night long 'cause I
(Oh, I)
(All around the world, girls, all around the world)
(This goes out to girls all around the world)

I just want to be your man
