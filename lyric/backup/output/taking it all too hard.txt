Oh, no, not this confused again
Oh, no not the same mistakes again
You're taking it all to heart
You're taking it all too hard

Why can't you see what's going on?
I know you'd never admit
You would ever be to blame
Everything's a game to you
The old days are gone
And they're better left alone
I cannot help you
It's much too late
