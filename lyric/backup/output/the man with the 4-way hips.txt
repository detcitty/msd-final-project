He's a man with the 4-way hips
He's a man with the 4-way hips
He's a man with the 4-way hips
He's a man with the 4-way hips

Street level, down in the ground
You can't miss it, so check this out
Lovers and fighters, the girls from next door
Rockin' and shockin' the whole dance floor
Disc-jockeys want him to get up
He can't resist that funky stuff
Soldiers and sailors, policemen, marines
Painters and poets are part of his scene

He's a man with the 4-way hips
He's a man with the 4-way hips
He's a man with the 4-way hips
He's a man with the 4-way hips
