I used to run around
You never tied me down
My feet are homeward bound
And I do love you

What are you waiting for
Come on and close the door
I couldn't love you more
Than I do love you

[CHORUS]
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on
Light on me
She put the light on
She put the light on
Lady, put the light on
Light on me
