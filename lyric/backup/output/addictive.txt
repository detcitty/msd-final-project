Addictive
He breaks my down
He builds me up
He fills, my cup, I like, it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we riot, we fall
He comes, in late, but he's, ok
He do, I do, he knows, the rules
He takes care of home, when he's not alone
I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream

He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
