I said, grandpa what's this picture here
It's all black and white, it ain't real clear
Is that you there? He said yeah, I was 11

Times were tough back in '35
That's me and uncle Joe just tryin' to survive
A cotton farm in a great depression

If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
