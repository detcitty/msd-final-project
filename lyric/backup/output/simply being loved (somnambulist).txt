so little time some little time... so frustrated
some little joy so little joy ...it's complicated
so little time some little time... time to work it all out
yeah yeah
so little joy some little joy... it's complicated
I feel I'm stumbling in the dark ...sonambulated
I feel my heart's again the sparks... I'm praying for love
(love love)
praying for love

some little joy some little joy... it's complicated
some little time some little time ...my heart's been faded
some little hope some little hope... and I pray again for love
(love love)
so hopin' enough
