Oh ohh

Silence takes over
Sayin' all we need to say
There's endless possibilities
In the moves we can make
Your kiss is giving every indication
If this heart of mine is right

By the time this night is over
The stars are gonna shine on two lovers in love
And when the morning comes
Its gonna find us together
In a love thats just begun
By the time this night is over
Two hearts are gonna fly to the Heavens above
