Can't raise a man...

Listen...
He got older, but never grew
For his life, he can't tell the truth...
How to love, he ain't got a clue
Playin' games like he'll never lose you...

Try to talk to him, can't get through
Every day, he's a different dude...
These are the signs of a grown-ass boy
Better run for the hills - I'm just trying to keep it real...
