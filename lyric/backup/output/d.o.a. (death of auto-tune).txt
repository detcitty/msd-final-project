Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin...
Begin... begin

This is anti-AutoTune, death of the ringtone
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song

Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don't have melodies
This shit make niggas wanna go and commit felonies

Ah, get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn
I know we facin' a recession
But the music y'all makin' gon' make it the great depression

Ah, or your lack of aggression
Pull your skirt back down, grow a set men
Ah, ah... nigga this shit violent
