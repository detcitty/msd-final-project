Rock, rock, rock... 

It's time to jam, y'all
Freaks, get up against the wall
And let's rock, hey

Ooh, ooh, yeah

No longer will I do all
The things that I used to do
Stood by your side in innocence
For my love was just for you

Well, I'm a big girl now
With big needs and desires
So don't you come around
If you can't take me higher

I like to rock a lot
Throw my love away
On on only one boy
I like to rock a lot
That's how it is of lately
Hey, hey, yeah

I like to rock a lot
I'll take a path and stay
