Would you like to live in Houston
Where the cowboys come to town
Or maybe Pensacola
Where the sun shines all year 'round
Or even New York City
Where the city never sleeps
I'm offering you the option
Before you get in too deep

If you can anything else,
Baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
