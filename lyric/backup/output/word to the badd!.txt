What up, yo
Word to the bad
I gave my love
You gave your love
Thought we'd never part
Said you loved me
Then you left me
With a broken heart
You never think about who you love
You only think about number one
You forgot about where we started from
You only think about what you want
You don't care about how it's done
You only think about you, your throne
Be it right or be it wrong
It ain't about your world
It ain't about the things that you do
If you don't care, I don't care
'Cause you keep thinkin' about you
It ain't about you takin' my pie
