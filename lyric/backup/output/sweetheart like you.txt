Hi
Girl you just caught my eye
Thought I should give it try
And get your name & your number
Go grab some lunch & eat some cucumbers
Why did I say that?
I don't know why.
But you're smilin' & it's something' I like
On your face, yeah it suits you
Girl we connect like we have bluetooth

I don't know why
I'm drawn to you
Could you be the other one so we'd equal two?
And this is all based on a lucky chance
That you would rather add than subtract

You & I
Could be like Sonny & Cher
Honey & Bears
And You & I
