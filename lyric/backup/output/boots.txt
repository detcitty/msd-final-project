No more trouble, 
In this town. 
Silent night, for a change. 

Brand new year, 
Coming up ahead. 
You know its been so long, 
Since I rang one in? 

I close my eyes, 
Think about the path I took. 
Just when I think these times, 
Have gotten the best of me. 

I can see my mother in the kitchen. 
My father on the floor,
