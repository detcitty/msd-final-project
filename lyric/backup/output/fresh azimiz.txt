When I was 8, I was rhymin' not back yard game playin'
Watchin' Snoop anxiously awaitin' for my chance man
Hot and cocky wit it 'cause I kno' that I am man
I'm goin' down in history like American Band Stand

I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
I stay on the top 'cause I keep comin' wit dough man
You steady watchin' stealin' but there ain't no hope man
You dealin' wit somethin' bigger than the US Open

And ain't no jokin'
Fresh like Fatlaces and Dukey ropes and I keep on smokin'
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm strokin'
Look at me now days girl a dawg is pokin'

Addicted to it, JD say I got it bad
18 nigga makin' more than ya dad see
They think they doin' it but I'ma out do 'em if
Ya kno' somebody like that pull up and say to 'em

Ye ain't ridin', ye ain't ridin'
Ye ain't bumpin' like I'm bumpin', ye ain't sayin' nuttin' homie
Ye ain't fresh azimiz
Ye ain't got it, ye ain't got it
You don't keep it thuggin' like I keep it thuggin'
Lil buddy you ain't fresh azimiz

Ye ain't big big whippin', ye ain't steady ti tippin'
No girl gettin' homie
You ain't fresh azimiz
Think ye iz, think ye iz
But cha ain't, but cha ain't
Think you can get it crunk like me but you can't
