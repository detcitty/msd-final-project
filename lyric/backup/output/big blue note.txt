(Toby Keith/Scotty Emerick)

See that big blue note,
Over there on the counter?
You don't wanna read that thing, man,
It's a real get-you-downer.
But don't you dare say nothin' else,
Bad about her: she's gone.

No, no, no, no, don't, don't throw it away,
'Cause tonight, I might need it.
It gets real lonely around here at night some times,
An' I have to read read it.
