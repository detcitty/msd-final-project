We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you
Too much, baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe
A word I say

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
