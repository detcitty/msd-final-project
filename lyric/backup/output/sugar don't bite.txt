Clothes are all made out of wood
Pricey show, worthy to mention
Dreams of a drifters at heart y'all
Bodies dance thru the doctors submission

Fast feet and Saturday night
Leave you no where to stand, no
Nobody hears you scream babe, now... 

Sugar don't bite
Just take me far with you
All through the night (the night)
I bet you taste sweeter

Sugar don't bite
I just want to please you
Don't make me beg ya'
Don't make me tease ya, no

Sugar don't bite
You know I'm a bleeder
Don't make this boy a (this boy)
Little misdeamenor, no

Sugar don't bite
Just sprinkle it on me
Do what ya' can, oh (do what ya can) (to me)
Do what ya' can to me

The beat is a groaning you up
