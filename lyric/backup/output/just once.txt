I did my best
But I guess my best wasn't good enough
'Cause here we are back where we were before...
Seems nothing ever changes
We're back to being strangers
Wondering if we oughta stay or head on out the door...
Just once
Can we figure out what we keep doing wrong?
Why we never last for very long
What are we doing wrong?
Just once
Can we find a way to finally make it right?
