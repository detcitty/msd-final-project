Mike Will Made It Nigga
Sremm Life
Black Barbies in the city
Fat ass and pretty titties
Get dummies for they money
You sent flowers but I wish I didn't receive 'em
All your lies I wish I didn't believe 'em

That boy is a real pussy pleaser
All that fetty but he never met Masika
Tuck the chrome 22 in his sneaker
El Chapo but he crazy like La Quica
Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate
But I shoulda listened to what momma told me
Furry moon boots, shades Dita
Too high to give a shit about PETA

Sativa so strong I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
