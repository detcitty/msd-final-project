If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had'
Was it everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
