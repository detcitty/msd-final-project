< 4: 30 in the morning, mira
you know what I mean, mira
let's get this money sorted and counted, word
know what I mean, dame te culo mami
give me my shit back, mira, hey yo
Fat Joe and them is here now, word
shine like marbles, collects diamonds
the remix, add on son
politic for the real ones...>

Chorus-Raekwon
We get knots, like stockbrokers who own Marriotts
Blast shots for all my niggas who splash cops
The rich Corleone camp is here, thousand and one
Corner son, fake a jack, you be a goner...

Raekwon-

Yo, control this rap like Napoleon
Half-Mongolian, hold it, you owe me in
Rock 'em like linolieum, yeah
Lex, diamonds, shin'in like you rhymin'
929'n, Titanium glass, time to play that ass
Whirlwinds of French, come movin' intense
Time to pull again, release the shell, well
Make 'em yell again, so sleek
But I'm a be maxin' in suites
Countin' your paper and countin' your sheeps
Hittin' your chick in Jeeps
Miraculously, attack your faculty, who wanna tackle me?
You jack mack, kidnap 'em for free
What?, you got heat, you better pop those
We movin' like gestapos, through underground potholes
That rock those, much land discoveries
Chrome rims, sippin' bubbly
Who livin' lovily, half a brick to cover me
So dissin' me, come on now listen G,
