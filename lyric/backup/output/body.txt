Woo!
Girl, i want your body.
you know i love your body.
girl, i need your body.
why don't you come home with me now.
Girl, i want your body.
you know i love your body.
girl, i need your body.
why don't you come home.
Never thought that i would hurt so bad.
and ever since the day that i met you,
all alone i sit 'cause i'm so sad.
don't you know this heart, it grieves for you?
There you were, holdin' back your love,
tryin' to make me feel real bad,
