Well, another day, another dollar
After I've sang and hollered
Oh, it's my way of living, and I can't change a thing
Another town is drawing near
Oh, baby, I wish you were here
But the only way I can see you, darlin', is in my dreams
It's a highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on

Well, the hurt you leave behind
It's the hurt that's on your mind
