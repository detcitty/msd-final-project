Funny how it's hard to find
The words sometimes you know
Wishin we could read minds
Don't wanna let our feelings show
So even if you say you don't understand
I'm willing to give as much time as I can

Every time our eyes meet
(Every time our eyes meet)
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
 (Talkin' to me)
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me

Just ain't no need for words to speak
'Cause every touch
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', to me
 (Between us)
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
 (Talkin' to me)

Your always actin' so composed and cool
Never got too many words for me
 (Too many words)
You always turn your head and make sure I see
 (Just to make sure)
