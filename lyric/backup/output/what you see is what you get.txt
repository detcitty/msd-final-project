M: There ain't no hidden treasure
In this pot of gold you see.
And no way for you to make
No sourpuss out of me.

F: Well I'm never ever gonna change your way
I take you as you are.
You got something that I want
That's worth waiting for.

Chorus:
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen nothing yet.
