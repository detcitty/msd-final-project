My life will never be the same
'Cause girl you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain
These things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me
Fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you need
Feels so right
(Girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life
(All my life)
Feels like I

(Like I)

Have finally found a perfect love this time
(And I finally found)

Come on, girl
You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

In time
I knew that love would bring
Such happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I've waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you

Keep doing what you do
