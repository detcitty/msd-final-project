Won't you come see about me
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out

Love's strange, surreal in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me
