Bombs away
Well, I guess I'm back in love again
Well, hey now, and around we go
This will bring me ruin
Though I suppose it's pleasing
I've changed the eyes I gaze in
Still, she's just another girl
And I need more than a trade in
Guess I'll have to change the world
Strike up the band
Well, I believe I have this dance
Hey, raise that glass again, my friend
Yes, of course, I'm charming
But she's so easy
Well, I've changed the tune I dance to
