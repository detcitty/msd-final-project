He was sitting there beside me
Throwin' doubles down when he ordered up his third one
He looked around, then he looked at me
And said I do believe I oughta have one more.
He said I hate this bar and I hate to drink,
But on second thought, tonight I think I hate everything.

Then he opened up his billfold and threw a 20 down
And a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground
