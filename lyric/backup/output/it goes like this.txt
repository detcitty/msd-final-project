Hey girl, you make me wanna write a song,
Sit you down, I'll sing it to you all night long,
I've had a melody in my head since she walked in here and knocked me dead.
Yeah girl, you make me wanna write a song

And it goes like ooh,
What I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms baby all around you.
And it goes like hey, girl I'm blown away,
