I dressed up in my best
My Ropers and my vest
And waited by the door with these roses
Till you came walkin' in
With your high falutin' friends
So busy lookin' down your noses
Now here you are ignorin' me
Girl I might as well be

Walkin' to Jerusalem
Marchin' with Methuselah
Readin' signs in Arabic
Ravin' like a lunatic
