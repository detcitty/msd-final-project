Johnny saw her riding on a street car named Desire
His fate was sealed
She could see him coming like a hundred other liars
It was no big deal

Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
Tito, he was king of the streets
She was his possession like a jewel on his crown
Johnny better run, better run

Better hide your heart, better hold on tight
Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire

Ah, ah, ah, ah, hey, hey, hey
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Ah, ah, ah, ah, hey, hey, hey
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

The ride was over but the story doesn't end
He took her heart
She looked him in the eye and said they couldn't meet again
You could see the trouble start
