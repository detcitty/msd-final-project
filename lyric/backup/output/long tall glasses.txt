I was travellin' down the road
feelin' hungry and cold
i saw a sign down the road sayin'
food and drinks for everyone
so naturally i thought
i would take me a look inside
i saw so much food
there was water coming from my eyes
Yeah there was ham and there was turkey
there was caviar
and long tall glasses
with wine up to y'are
and somebody grabbed me
