We used to be number 10, now we permanent on one
In the battle lost my finger, Mic became my arm
Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy Naah squeeze the Charmin
Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born, Jon
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken George became Dead George stealin' chickens from my farm
Damn, another dead pigeon
If your mafiosos then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was tongue-kissing a razor blade
That sounds sick maybe one day I'll write a horror
Blackula comes to the ghetto, jacks an ACURA
Stevie Wonder sees Crack Babies
Be-Coming Enemies Of their own families
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side, just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Trying to front like he's down with Mount Zion

Oooh La La La
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang
Oooh La La La
It's the natural LA that the Refugees bring
