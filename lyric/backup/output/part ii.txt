(Method Man: Motherfucker get high)

High (Let's Get)
High (Let's Get)
High (Let's Get)
High (Let's Get)

[Method Man]
Tical shittin again -- spittin to win
Loaded guns, clip in the end, none sicker than him
Yes indeed, I'm ill as any STD's or sex disease
These dirty rats want extra cheese
On that piece of the pie, now ask me how high?
Until ya reach for the sky blame the crooked letter I
That's my home, 23's wrapped in chrome
Not only snap on y'all niggaz but I'll snap dem bones
Slap your dome, make you leave that crack alone
You got the, key to the city but the latch is on
I gots it locked, bringin the noise bringin the Funk Doctor Spock
Bringin my boys bringin you lungs
Pop the glock but only if you feel this shit
Jack the Ripper, don't make me have to kill this bitch
Back to get'cha put it in check that's the Mista
Meth with his wood on your neck, shut your lips up
