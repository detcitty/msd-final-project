Hey hey
They say it's never too late and though
That might be the case sometimes
Sad truth of it is opportunity won't knock twice
Put off until tomorrow but tomorrow might never come
Gotta think about the future, today soon will be long gone

Where will you be a few years down the line?
Will it be everything you've dreamed of?
(Everything you've dreamed of?)
Always harder to do what is right
Sometimes one bad decision can mess up your life

Seal our fate with the choices we make
But don't give a second thought to all the chances we take
Could come up anytime, better be wide awake
'Cause we seal our fate with the choices we make
Seal our fate, we seal our fate
Seal our fate, seal our fate with the choices we make
