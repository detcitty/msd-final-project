From the moment I saw you
I went outta my mind
Though I never believed in
Love at first sight
But you got a magic boy
That I just can't explain
Well you gotta, you gotta way
That you make me feel
I can do, I can do anything for you baby
I'll be down for you baby
Lay all my cards out tonight
Just call on me baby
I'll be there in a hurry
It's your move so baby baby decide

Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given my ecstasy
You are my fantasy

I'm your baby tonight

From the second you touched me
I was ready to die
