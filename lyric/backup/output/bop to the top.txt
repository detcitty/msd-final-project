(feat. Lucas Grabeel)

[Sharpay:]
I believe in dreamin'
Shootin' for the stars

[Ryan:]
Baby to be number one
You've got to raise the bar

[Sharpay:]
Kickin' and a scratchin'
Grindin' out my best

[Ryan:]
Anything it takes
To climb the ladder of success

[Both:]
Work our tails off every day
Gotta bump the competition
Blow them all away

[Sharpay:]
