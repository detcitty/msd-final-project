When I'm down I make a call.
Got the number written on the wall.
First it's busy then I try again.
Oh, who's she talking to, could it be him?

I got the number and it starts to ring.
I get excited and I start to dream.
I start to fantasize of memory lane.
Then she answers and she says right way.
She says I'm home on my own, home all alone.
