G-G-Giving you, giving you.
G-G-Giving you, giving you.
G-G-Giving you, giving you.
Here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4.
Lately, I've been trying to figure out your mind and why you keep dissin' me,
Poor little me.
And why you have a change of heart to turn it all around
And then try to put it on me,
Poor little me.
But don't you know I can be a trip.
I can make things hard.
But baby, I believe that you still got a heart.
That's why I try to stop myself before I start,
'Cause I can make it tough.
I can make it rough, but I won't.
Well, I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt.
I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out.
Baby, work it on, work it on out. (Work, work, work.)
Baby, work it on, work it on out. (Work, work, work.)
Oooh, oooooooooh.
Baby, how could you be hanging out on the town
And claim that you're missing me,
Poor little me,
When you knew all the time that you could've been with your homegirl lovin' and a kissin' on me,
Sweet little me.
But don't you know if you wanna be a man,
You gotta work real hard.
If you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one,
Then nothing in the world should make us part.
'Cause we can make it work, if you take away the hurt from my heart.
I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
