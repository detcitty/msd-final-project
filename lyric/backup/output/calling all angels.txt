I need a sign,
to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed
over the atmosphere

I need to know,
that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning
in a sea spilled from a cup

When there is no place safe
and no safe place to put my head
When you can feel the world shake
from the words that are said

And I-I-I-I'm,
calling all angels
And I-I-I-I'm,
calling all you angels
