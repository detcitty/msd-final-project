Callin' my river to let her know
I'ma be on my way
Missin' how the river flow even though
It's only been a couple of days

'Cause it be raining and complaining you
Got that water made for drinking up
Baby if I drown tonight it's all worth it for you
I don't need no rescue

I'ma hold my breath until you feel it in your chest
When I go under, under
I ain't coming up until you scream and knock it off
When I go under, under

You be making waves, my ship's here to stay
I got what it takes to swim up in it all day
