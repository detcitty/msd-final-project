You need to give love
Another try.
One bad love affair, 
You never die?

I know he broke your heart, 
Too, girl.
But hey, it's not the end
Of the world.
I'm here to try
To comfort you.
From all the changes
He put you through.

[Chorus:]
I wanna, 
Make you feel love again.
Let you know that you got a friend.
I wanna, 
Make you feel love again.
I'll stick by you
To the very end.
[End Chorus]
