Hey..T.I.P.
(You know yo folk be stayin down on the rode man 
rollin all the way from Florida, M.I.A.
on up to duevall on up to Tennesse. 
a lot of the real niggas be showin love you know wha i'm sayin, 
i really appreciate that.. 
all the dope boys be comin out 
all the home girls be showin love, 
but a lot of folks man, 
they still be looking like who i'm is...let me tell them...)

Who i'm is?
Rubberband Man wild as the Taliban
Nine in my right
45 in my other hand
Who i'm is?
Call Me troubl-man
Always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundread grand
Chevy's all Colors man
Who i'm is?

Rubber band man like a one man band
Treat these niggas like The Apollo
and i'm the Sandman
Tote a hundred grand
carrying it in the waste band
looking for a sweet lick
this is the wrong place man
Seven time Felon
Aye, what i care about a case man
I campaignin to bury the hate
so say your grace man
Aye i don't talk behind a nigga back
I say it in his face
I'm a thorough bred nigga
i don't fake it and i don't hate
Check the resume' nigga
My records' impecable
anywhere in the A nigga, Tip is highly respectable
and in M.I.A. nigga, i'm tryin to keep it proffessional
Cuz all this tongue ration, finna have me snappin i'm tellin ya
