Ooh, this morning when I woke up
Sunshine touched my heart
Children of the earth
They walk so far apart

From this protection
Of what's supposed to be
They don't have it going like
You and me

Oh, and who loves your neighbor
They seem to miss the boat
Letting others drown
So they can stay afloat

But we have love so real
Just let them be
I wanna thank someone
For sendin' you to me

Bless your mother
Bless your father
