Let's jump in my El Camino - Uh huh
Roll the windows down
Thought we could see what kind of trouble
we can find out on this messed up little town

The Boss on the radio- uh huh
Take whatever comes
We'll go flying down the highway with my arms around you singing Born To Run

It feels just like it should
Must be some kind of miracle
Like I got sun on my face and the rain ain't never going to fall
