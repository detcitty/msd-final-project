These words are my own

Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
It's who I am, it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you

Try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration
(But it's not coming easily)

Woah oh!
Trying to find the magic (Woah oh)
Trying to write a classic (Woah oh)

Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know? (Woah oh)
Waste-bin full of paper

Clever rhymes, see you later
These words are my own
From my heart flow
