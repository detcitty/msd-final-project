Remember when we said goodbye
I wiped my tears, you didn't cry
We both said things we didn't mean
Reaching for the hope, but caught between the screams

And I would try to calm you down
But you wouldn't listen
And now I find you're not around
And it's your love I'm missin'

Louder than love
Louder than love
That's what we were, we were
Louder than love
And we couldn't make things better

Louder than love
Louder than love
