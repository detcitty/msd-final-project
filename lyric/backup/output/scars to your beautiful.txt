She just wants to be, beautiful
She goes, unnoticed she knows, no limits
She craves, attention she praises, an image
She prays to be, sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see, the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain, and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry, after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change it's heart
No scars to your beautiful,
we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

And you don't have to change a thing
