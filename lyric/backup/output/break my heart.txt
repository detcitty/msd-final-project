So you're the girl
I heard the rumor
You got the boys wrapped around your finger
Such a sweet heartbreaker
If you're the game, I wanna be a player
Oh, you can do whatever you want
It's alright with me

Why don't you break my heart
Make it hurt so bad
Come on give it your best
Nothing less, I insist,
I want it just like that
Why don't you break my heart
It sounds good to me
Do it over again, again, again
