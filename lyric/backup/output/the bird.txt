What time is it?
Alright, y'all got 10 seconds to get to the dance floor.
Whawk!
C'mon now...

America, have you heard? I got a brand new dance and it's called "The bird"
You don't need no finesse or no personality, you just need two arms and an attitude.
And everybody sing with me, come on now!

Whawk! Hallelujah! Whoa!

Brothers, don't be cool. Women like it sometimes when you act a fool.
Sisters, don't be shy. Let your body get loose, you ain't too fat to fly.
Come on now! Whawk! Hallelujah! Whoa!
