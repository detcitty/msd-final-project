Tu tu ru tu tu tu tu ooh, baby
(Yea, baby)
Tu tu ru tu tu tu tu ooh, baby
(Oh yea)
I need a lover to give me

The kind of love that will last always

I need somebody uplifting
To take me away, babe
Oh yea, yea
I want a lover who knows me, yea
(Ooh, baby)
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me

Through the long, lonely nights
Till the dawn
Why don't you take me away?
Dreamlover come rescue me
