I don't need you
I don't need you half as much
As you need me
And I thank my lucky stars
That you have freed me

'Cause I'm losing weight at last
Losing weight and losing sleep
And losing my mind fast

I don't need you
I don't miss you in the way
I expected
I have time to clean the sink
And feel neglected
