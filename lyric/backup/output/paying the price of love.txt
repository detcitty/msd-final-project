How did you find there was somebody
More than you want me
I never understood
Maybe I have never had you
I have been lonely for you lately
I can't wait another day
And when you let me get you close to me
You run and leave me

Paying the price of love
The start of my end over you
When you're doin' it for someone
Who'll never be free
Now is all there will ever be
