One to da two da three da four
Dem dirty Red Dogs done hit the door
And they got everybody on they hands and knees
And they ain't gonna leave until they find them keys

Now if dirty Bill Clinton fronted me some weight
Told me to keep two, bring him back eight
And I only brought him five and stuck his ass for three
Do you think that Clampett will sick his goons on me?
See Martail Homes, that's my claim to fame
That's where I learned my slickest trick in the dope-d-game
Like my favorite, I call it lemon head delight
That's when you lick off all the yellow and you sell the white

Right, well if pimpin' be a sport I be bein' the wide receiver
That nigga B-I-G will make ya'll niggas believers
Sippin' on Cuervo Gold off in the club drunk as fuck
Callin' them hoes bitches, and smokin' my weed up
When I'm too sober, year older, now I'm almost legal
Wanted to live the life of Cadillacs, Impalas and Regals
