She wakes up in the morning with the new sunrise
Looks at her husband sleeping still
Inside she cries

She makes the children breakfast
Gets them on their way
Watching them through the window
She prepares to face another day

Then her husband tells her
That he won't be home â€˜til late
There's so much work he'll have to stay behind
