You think that something's happening
And it's bigger than your life
But it's only what you're hearing
Will you still remember
When the morning light has come?
Will the songs be playing over and over
Till you do it all over again?

Play
 (Play)
Play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right?
