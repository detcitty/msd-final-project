Every time you come around
I feel my world starts turning topsy-turvy
And I just can't fight the spin
Baby, won't you listen to this love
Whose hearts been missing and don't hurt me
'Cause I'm falling your way again

Am I weak
Well, sometimes I just can't hardly speak
That I have to pinch myself to be sure
That this love is more than I can endure
Sweet thing, you've got me signing

Ooo la-la-la
It's the way that you feel when you know it's real
Ooo la-la-la
It's the warm that's inside when you're satisfied

Ooo la-la-la
It's a dream that lasts forever
Ooo la-la-la
Let's stay together, oh

I can see it there
That look upon your face is saying love's in making
Boy, I know what's on your mind
Love is for the lasting
And it's your just for the asking for the taking
'Cause I'm falling your way this time
