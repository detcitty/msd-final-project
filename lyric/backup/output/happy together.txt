Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night
It's only right

To think about the one you love
And hold her tight
So happy together

If I should call you up
Invest a dime
And you say you belong to me
You'd ease my mind

Imagine how the world
Could be so very fine
So happy together

I can't see me
