I need a gangsta bitch
(A gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo
(A gangsta bitch)

I wanna Gangsta boogie with my
(Gangsta bitch)
I want a, I need a
(Gangsta bitch, gangsta bitch)

I need a gangsta bitch
(A gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo
(A gangsta bitch)

I wanna gangsta boogie with my
(Gangsta bitch)
I need a, I want a
(Gangsta bitch, gangsta bitch)

Yo, I need a gangsta bitch
she don't sleep and she don't play
Stickin' up girls from around the fuckin' way
Strapped but lovable, hateful but huggable

Always in trouble and definitely fuckable
See her now, booms and pounds, she's mine friend
Puffin' on a blunt, sippin' on a Heineken
She's got charm, a firearm to match mine

Goin' to the movies packin' his and her nine's
Wearin' Carhart and leather, motherfuck the weather
On Valentine's Day, doin' stick-ups together
No one to blame, no shame in her game

And when we fuck she makes me scream out her name
She's not petty, confidant, ready
Right for late night, we play fight with Machetes
This goes out to all the gangsta hoe pros
Give me a ghetto girl, fuck a Soul Train hoe

I need a gangsta bitch yo
(A gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch
(A gangsta bitch)

I wanna gangsta boogie with my
(Gangsta bitch)
I need a, I want a
(Gangsta bitch, gangsta bitch)

I want a gangsta bitch yo
(A gangsta bitch)
I need a gangsta bitch
