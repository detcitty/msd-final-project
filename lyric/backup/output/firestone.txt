I'm a flame, you're a fire
I'm the dark in need of light
When we touch, you inspire
Feel the change in me tonight

So take me up, take me higher
There's a world not far from here
We can dance in desire
Or we can burn in love tonight

Our hearts are like firestones
And when they strike, we feel the love
Sparks will fly, they ignite our bones
