Long ago
Just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you

Burning on
Just like a match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know
And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I could say?
Things are better if I stay
