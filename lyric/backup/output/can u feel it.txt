Friday night and it's the weekend
Everybody's speaking
Let the party people show you how
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now
No, no

And we're doing what we wanna
Everybody's gonna
Gonna party till the break of dawn
And the dj's jamming all night long
Oh, yeah

Can you feel it in the air
When the music's playing?
People everywhere are saying
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Can you feel it in the beat
When your body's moving?
And you're in so deep and grooving
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

And we're doing what we wanna
Everybody's gonna
Gonna party till the break of dawn
And the dj's jamming all night long
All night long

You can do what you wanna do
