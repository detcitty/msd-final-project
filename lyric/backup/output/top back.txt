Creme de la Creme homie
Mannie Fresh I got you nigga
I'm gonna show these niggaz what to do with one of your beats
I'm shuttin' the whole block down
Here comes trouble homey

I'ma tell you how the king like to ride homeboy
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
Holla if ya like ya Kenwood high and ya top let back

If ya rims sit high and ya windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
Holla if ya like ya Kenwood high and ya top let back

If ya rims sit high and ya windows pitch black
I'm the man in my city ain't nobody fuckin' wit me
You can ask the real niggaz and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's

And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watchin' some television
Shorty I'm never slippin' got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to trippin'

Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whippin'
Pimp stolen the automobile and the roof for the tag missin'
Polices try to pursue me it's nothin' but gas given'
