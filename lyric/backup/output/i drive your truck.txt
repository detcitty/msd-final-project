Eighty-nine cents in the ashtray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade
Rollin' in the floorboard

That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dogtags hangin' from the rear view
Old Skoal can and cowboy boots
And a "Go Army" shirt folded in the back

This thing burns gas like crazy
But that's all right
People got their ways of copin'
Oh, and I've got mine

I drive your truck
I roll every window down
