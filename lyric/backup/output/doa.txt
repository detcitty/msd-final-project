Oh, you know I did it
It's over and I feel fine
Nothing you can say is gonna change my mind
Waited, and I waited the longest night
Nothing like the taste of sweet decline

I went down, I fell, I fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever, 'cause nothing lasts
Dancing with the bones of my buried past

Nevermind, there's nothing I can do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die, my dear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time
