Oh, oh, oh, say it!
Make love to me
Oh, oh, oh, what?
Fuck me
Oh, oh, oh, say it!
Make love to me
Oh, oh, oh, what?
Fuck me

I'm 'bout to throw some game
They both wantin' the same
Cupid's the one to blame, say it
Make love to me

I'm 'bout to shed some light
'Cuz each and every night
You've got to do it right, what?
Fuck me

I'm 'bout to throw some game
They both wantin' the same
Cupid's the one to blame, say it
Make love to me

I'm 'bout to shed some light
'Cuz each and every night
You've got to do it right, what?
Fuck me

They want it nice and slow
Kiss them from head to toe
Relax and let it go, say it
Make love to me
They want it now and fast
Grabbin' and smackin' ass
You gotta make it last, what?
Fuck me

Together holdin' hands
You out there spendin' grands
And makin' family plans, say it
Make love to me
Don't have to straighten facts
Don't want no strings attached
Just scratches on yo' back, what?
Fuck me

Ex's ain't actin' right
And you so glad to fight
Dinners by candlelight, say it
Make love to me
She got a nigga whipped
Down to your fingertips
Tryin' that freaky shit, what?
Fuck me
