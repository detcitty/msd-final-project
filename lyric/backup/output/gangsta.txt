Yo shoot em Biv
Yeah Bell Biv Devoe bouncing across the Air Waves
Shoot em
Shoot em Rick
Spidermans in the house, shootem

No one even knows it
Girl to me you just cant show it
You know that i wont buy it
Girl, theres no use to tryin to hide it
Cos I girl you know i need it
Behind the back girl ive seen it
Take me as a joking prankster
I cant believe my girlfriends a gangsta

Not my baby
I lost my trust in you
Its really driving me crazy
And I dont know what im gonna do
Im going outta my mind
And if she keeps it up were through
You take me as a prankster
