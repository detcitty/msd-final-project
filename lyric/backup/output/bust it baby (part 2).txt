Bust It Baby

Aye can I please talk to my bust it babies real quick homie
Let me bring you in my world, and let you know what i call my lil bust it baby
{Ne-Yo}

She got me speedin' in the fast lane

Pedal to the floor mayne, tryna get back to her love
Best believe she got that good thang
She my little hood thang, ask around they know us
You'll know that's mine...
BUSTTTTTT ITTTT... bay bay bayy
Everybody know that's mine.
BUSTTTT ITTTTT... bay bay bayy
Everybody know thats mine.
{Plies}

If i wasn't married to the streets, it'd be you

Yo lips what make you so cute
Love when you poke yo mouth out when you mad too
Save your number in my phone under Lil Boo
Like your sex but more love what cha do
Turn me on how you stare at me when we through
When you give it to me, i don't wanna turn ya loose
