This song is dedicated to some people, with whom I had the pleasure of living over half the years I've lived, 'til now, when we come to our fork in the road.

And though our feet may travel a different path from now on, I want them to know how I feel about them, and that I wish them well.

Sweet harmony, 
Go on and and blow on.
Stay in perfect tune, 
With your own familiar song.

Make the world aware, 
That you're still goin' strong.
Go on, 
Spread your joy around the world.
Spread your joy around the world.

Sweet harmony, 
Yeah, yeah.
Go on and blow on.
