I think it's so cute and I think it's so sweet!
How you let your friends encourage you to try and talk to me
But let me stop you there
Oh, before you speak...

Nah to the ah to the, no, no, no!

My name is no
My sign is no
My number is no
You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the, no, no, no!
My name is no
My sign is no
My number is no
You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
Nah to the ah to the, no, no, no!

First you gonna say you ain't runnin' game, thinkin' I'm believing every word
Call me beautiful, so original, telling me I'm not like other girls
I was in my zone before you came along, now I'm thinking maybe you should go
Blah, blah, blah, blah
I be like nah to the I, to the I, to the no, no, no!

All my ladies listen up
If that boy ain't giving up
Lick your lips and swing your hips
Girl all you gotta say is...

My name is no
My sign is no
My number is no
You need to let it go
