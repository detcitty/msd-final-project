Double Up
I'm A Flirt Remix
(i'm a, i'm a, i'm a, i'm a) flirt
Soon as i see her walk up in the club (i'm a flirt)
Winkin eyes at me, when i roll up on them dubs (i'm a flirt)
Sometimes when i'm with my chick on the low (i'm a flirt)
And when she's wit her man lookin at me, damn right (i'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz (i'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz (i'm a flirt)
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and u trust her
Then don't bring her around me cuz (i'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes i be pimpin like i supposed to
Rollin like i supposed to
Shinin like i supposed to
In the club, fuckin wit honeys like i supposed to
I don't understand it when a nigga bring his girlfriend to club
Freakin all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club
And wonderin why all these playas tryin to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga i'm gon holla at her
A dog on the prowl when i'm walkin through the mall
If i could man i probably would flirt wit all of y'all
Yeah, yeah homie u say she yo girlfriend
But when i step up to her i'ma be like, "cousin"
Believe me man, this is how them playas do it in the chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff yo bitch
Cuz hey i'm black, handsome, i sing plus i'm rich and (i'm a flirt)

(i'm a, i'm a, i'm a, i'm a)

Hey homie, if u ain't gettin no money
U better keep her away from me ya dig.

Well if u love ya girl
And wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin up and askin me to meet ya girl
Because i'm well enough a flirt when i speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide
I seent u girl
Better treat your girl right
Cuz another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
Cuz u leave your wife
And i see ya wife
That be for real
How long u think that's finna be ya wife
