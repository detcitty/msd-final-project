Now, I've been happy lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun.

Oh, I've been smilin' lately
Dreamin' about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Some day it's going to come

'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train.
Oh, peace train take this country.
Come take me home again.

Now, I've been smiling lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun.
