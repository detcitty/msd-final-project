Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I'm crashing into you
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Baby, love me lights out
In the darkest night hours
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
