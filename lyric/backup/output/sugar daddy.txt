Doo-doo, ba doo-doo-dood oo
Doo-doo, ba doo-doo-dood oo
Doo-doo, ba doo-doo-dood oo
Doo-doo, ba doo-doo-dood oo

Ooh, brand new boots I bought ya
Fine, fine, blew your mind
Fin'lly thought I caught ya
And you love was mine all mine

I see you walk by with other guys
Step, step, steppin' on my toes
The whole world's talkin' 'bout
How I'm your standby Santa Claus

But ooh, your kisses thrill me
Sure love your angel eyes
The devil in you kills me
But I made up my mind
