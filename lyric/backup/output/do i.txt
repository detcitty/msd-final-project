Baby, what are we becoming
It feels just like we're always running
Rollin' through the motions every day
I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know
I just want us back to the way we were before

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
