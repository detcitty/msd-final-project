Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me and loving all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
Now the current's only pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this

'Cause it's not my time
I'm not going
There's a fear in me
And it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooo but I won't go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
