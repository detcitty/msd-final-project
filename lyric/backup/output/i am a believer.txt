Oh, go

Girl, it's been awhile
You've lost your pretty smile, what happened?
Oh, was it something that they said
That's playing with your head, what happened? Oh, oh

When you're standing in the spotlight, woman
Some people try and take a shot
Well, it's only jealousy, only jealousy, oh, they can't see our love
But one thing you can be sure of
