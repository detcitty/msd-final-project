I thought it was over
I thought I could move on
But I was wrong
I woke up last night
Calling your name
Feeling the blame baby

Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love

What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
