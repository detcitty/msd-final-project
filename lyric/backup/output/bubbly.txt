Will you count me in?

I've been awake for a while now
You got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face...
I get "the tinglies" in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now

Just take your time
Wherever you go
