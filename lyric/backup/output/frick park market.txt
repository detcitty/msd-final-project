Uh let me get, uh turkey sandwich
Uh, lettuce, tomato (bitch)

My name Mac Miller, who the f-ck are you?
Well my crew too live but I ain’t Uncle Luke
And I ain’t no hipster, girl I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Looking out my monocle
I’m dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cockroach, I’m heroin cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and f-cking shiny word to Mop & Glo
Tryin’ to get a mansion ain’t nobody here gonna find my room
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my socks stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day these losers always goin’ with whats trendy
My pen game is something these motherf-ckers have never seen
