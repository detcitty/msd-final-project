Don't be, don't be, don't be, don't be

Girl, the only thing that matters in my life
Is that I'm down for you and treat you right
You've got no call to treat me cold as ice
Oh oh, girl as long as I've been givin' my love to you
You should be givin' me your love, too
But you just keep on actin' just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no don't be cruel
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh don't be cruel

Hey yo' Kimmy what's up with this attitude
I thought I was bein' real good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks girl that ain't right

I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high post but you play me close
If I want to drink up you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from 9 to 5
