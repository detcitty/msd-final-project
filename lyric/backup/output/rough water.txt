Hey oh, never let go of me (Never let go)
Hold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (Hold tight, hold tight)
Never never let you drown (never), even if we're going down (Going down)
Hey oh, never let go of me
When I'm sinking

Loose lips sink ships that's what someone told me
But this boat will stay afloat for as long as you hold me
We been through rough water anytime it was tougher
But the fact I came back to remind you I love ya
And if that's not enough, well I can one up ya
I pinky promise touch thumbs I'll never make you suffer
And all I ask in return is some reciprocation
I'll be your oxygen when you're running out of patience
So take a deep breath, and hold it tight
My heart is yours just reassure me that you'll hold it right
Don't be offended, I'm just the cautious type
