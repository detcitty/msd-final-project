Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby
Come on over, come on over baby

Hey boy, don't you know?
I've got something goin' on, yes I do
All my friends are gonna come
Gonna party all night long, ooh yeah

I know you know
I just want us to go
The fun we'll have
You'll never be alone

So boy, won't you come?
We will party 'til the dawn
Listen to me

(All I want is you)
Come over here baby
(All I want is you)
You make me go crazy

(All I want is you)
Now baby don't be shy
You better cross the line
