Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I´m home bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder...

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
´Cause you know I´d walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you
Tonight

It´s always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder
