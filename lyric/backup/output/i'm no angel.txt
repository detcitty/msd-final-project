No, I'm no angel
No, I'm no stranger to the streets
I've got my label
So I won't crumble at your feet

And I know, baby
So I got scars upon my cheek
And I'm not crazy
Come on and love me, baby

So you found me hard to handle
Well, I'm easier to hold
So you like my spurs that jingle
And never leave you cold
