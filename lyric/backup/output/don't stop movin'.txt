Oh yeah.
You've got...
Oh yeah.
You've got to get it right.
You can do anything that you want to do
Put your mind, body and soul to it,
Prove it to yourself and say
I want (I want), I will (I will),
I can do anything.
It's a difficult world and you have got to prove
That you're ready and you can do it.
Nothing in this world would stop you,
I know, I can, I will fulfill my dreams.
Don't stop movin', keep it up.
