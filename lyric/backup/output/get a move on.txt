Ain't had enough, 
How long has it been? 
But I got, 
Nothin' put in.
Money wants money.
Don't make me laugh.
Money got funny, 
It's a thing of the past.

Got to move on... 
Got to move on... 

Hurry up and heat it up, 
I just can't seem
To get enough.
Grab your coat, 
Get on my bike.
We're gonna leave here tonight.
We're gonna leave here tonight.

So... 
Come on, come on, 
Get a move on.
I said, come on, come on, 
Get a move on.

If we stay here
