Look up on the wall, there on the floor,
Under the pillow, behind the door.
There's a crack in the mirror.
Somewhere there's a hole in a window-pane.
Do you think I'm to blame?
Tell me do you think I'm to blame?

When they do it you're never there.
When they show it you stop and stare.
Abacab He's in anywhere.
