ghostbusters
If there's somethin' strange in your neighborhood

Who you gonna call?
(ghostbusters)
If it's somethin' weird and it don't look good
Who you gonna call?

(ghostbusters)
I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost
If you're seein' things runnin' through your head

Who can you call?
(ghostbusters)

An invisible man sleepin' in your bed
Oh who you gonna call?
(ghostbusters)
I ain't afraid of no ghost
