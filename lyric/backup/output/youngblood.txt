Take a walk around midnight in the city
Young blood is hiding there somewhere
If you're looking for something to do
There's always something happening there

Like I & Bragger, we borrowed a coupe today
Here come Pepe and she's got a friend in a Chevrolet
But she ain't running, she's walking a little slow
And she ain't crying, she's just singin' a little low
