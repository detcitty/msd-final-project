I flex my brasos hardcore down for the clicka
Who's that eminating funk through the speaka
Bass gets to thumping ruckus get to pumping
Who's that rocking got the party start jumping

Blasting through hah, no need for the boy
Right hammer with the one knuckle eye-shot through ya
Step to the crowd I feel the strain'
Throw chingasos in the moshpit feel the pain

So, don't get in my way, baby
Because the huero loco came in here to play, baby
My shit will pump up this jam hot damn it's the baddest
Tres Delinquentes step into the madness

(Horns)
Get funky, get funky, get funky
