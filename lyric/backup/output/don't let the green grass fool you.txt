Girl, try to remember
When we didn't have no shoes
We stuck together, just me and you
It took a long time, to get what we got today
Now ya wanna give it all up for another guy

Baby, I'm tellin' ya
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Don't let it change your mind

It's gonna be hard for me, baby
Build my life all over
