All my friends had to ask me
Something they didn't understand
How I get all the women
In the palms of my hand

And I told them to
Treat her like a lady (treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)
The best you can do (treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)
You got to treat her like a lady
And she'll give in to you
Lord, you can see
You know what I mean

I know you've heard (treat her like)
That a woman (got to treat her like)
Will soon take advantage of you (treat her like, got to treat her like)
Let me tell you (treat her like)
