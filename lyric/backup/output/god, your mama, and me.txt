That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah, shoot right through ya, make you feel alive
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
