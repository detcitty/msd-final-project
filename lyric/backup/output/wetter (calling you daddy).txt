I'm callin' ya daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy, daddy
I need a daddy, daddy
Won't you be my daddy, daddy
Come and make it rain down on me
Come and make it rain down on me

Now come and kick it with the Twista
Black Caddy, Mack Daddy with a hoe up in the back seat
With the '97 pimp flow gotta feelin' when you smokin'
When I flip it to a track speed?

Talkin' about a beautiful figure astonishin' as Greek mythology
Body be just like a girl in uh, what's that movie?
Never mind, let me enter your atmosphere
As you enter my world and lemme touch that booty

I can't believe that your momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishin' soul, you need a modelin' role
Still a playa know you got it when you climbin' from the bottom
To the top of that pole 'cause you can pop and control

Your fatty's so accurate when I'm smackin' it
It's makin' me say what I gotta do to get with that?
When it come to makin' it rain, I can get it wet
