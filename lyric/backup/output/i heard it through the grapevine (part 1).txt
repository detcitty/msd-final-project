Grapevine
(Grapevine)

Ooh, grapevine, ooh, grapevine
(Grapevine)
Ooh, grapevine, ooh, sho' 'nuff I need you
(Heard it through the grapevine)

I heard that you're gonna leave me, oh, I
Oh, yeah, I heard that you're gonna leave me, oh, I
I heard it through the grapevine, oh
Oh, oh, oh, I heard it through the grapevine

Somebody told me 'bout your plans to leave me
Oh, oh, oh, I heard it through the grapevine, oh, wow
(Wow)

Better you wondered how I knew 'bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between us guys you know I love you much more
It took me by surprise, I must say, when I found out yesterday, oh, Lord

I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
(Heard it through the grapevine, longer would you be mine)
