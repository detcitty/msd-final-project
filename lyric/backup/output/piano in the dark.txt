When I find myself watching the time
I never think about
All the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now?

I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when
I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but, oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pulling me back
Back to love you

I know, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
