Oh, oh, oh DJ Khaled!
Konvict Music

We the best (yeah) we takin' over, listen!

Aye, aye started in Atlanta, then I spread out wit' it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi

On to North Carolina, Philadelphia and Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn. holla at me

Me in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett

Drop six-fo', three-wheel then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Glock fo'-fifty, blow your head off wit' it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it

King got the crown then sped off it wit' it
Say you need bricks, I said I get it

If you want to, we can supply you

Got enough work, to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you, unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground
'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
