Yeah, 1997
Tony Fantell
Me and my crazy world
You know what I'm saying
Will my niggas that feel me throw your hands up
You know what I'm saying
All my honeys that know how we do throw your hands up
This the joint, for real
Yeah, we got my team in here
[incomprehensible] how we always do representing knocking shit down
Yeah, right
Feel me, yeah
Come on

Now, I'm in love with these two chicks
I don't know which one to pick
My feelings for them both are getting thick
Now am I wrong 'cause I don't wanna lose none of them
Am I confused? 'Cause I don't wanna choose one of them

It's no doubt I think about my honeys everyday
It's no question show my honeys love in every way
Possible, I once took my shorty to the hospital
She cut that hand on glass, plus I love that ass

Short and sexy, lips always wet see
I go downtown 'cause it's fresh plus she lets me
Rub it the right way like Johnny Gill would say
I'm glad you feel that way, sometimes we just chill and lay

In the sack, I rub her back when we're resting
It was love at first sight my confession
She know who she is, can't say her name
'Cause if I do I won't be true to my game
Word up

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix, I'm in love with two women
That's word to moms, I got two honeys on my arms
And I don't wanna let none of them go

Yo, I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix, I'm in love with two women
