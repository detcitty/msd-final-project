Ooh? hoo? hoo?
Oh? hey?

After spending my whole weekend
Kicking back with all my friends
Think my battery has run out
But I fight to raise my hand

And I get a little nervous
Watching day turn into night
Read another bedtime story
Before you turn out the light

Tuck me in (Mmm)
And hold me real right
That's the only way I'll know
Everything is gonna be alright
