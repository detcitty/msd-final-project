Keep Them Kisses Comin’

(Dallas Davidson, Ben Hayslip)

You got your hair down

You got that look in your eye

That says come here and get me boy

Lay me down and love me just right, yeah

Ain’t goin no where

I got a bottle of wine

I got nothin’ but time on my hands

And I’m gonna be your man tonight, ah yes I am
