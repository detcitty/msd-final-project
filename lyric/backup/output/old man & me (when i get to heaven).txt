Well, an old man said to me in a voice filled with pain,
"Where you going young man?"
Said I'm going to fight a war,
gonna fight for my country in some foreign land.
He said,"The sun will never hurt you, never harmed anyone,
but you must realize if you try to stare her down, she will win in the end.
She will burn your eyes, she will burn them."

Seen a million places, seen a million faces die.
