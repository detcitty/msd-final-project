Stopped to have a few at five
Now you're crossing that center line for the third time
Second time like this, this week
Had a friend ask you for your keys, you said, "No I'm fine"

You sure do act like
You ain't got a thing to lose
But every car you pass
Might be the one's you take with you

You'd give your last breath to your wife
Take a bullet for your kids
Lay your life down for your country
For your Jesus, for your friends

There's a whole lot of things
You say you're living for
