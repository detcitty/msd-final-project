So raise your hands to heaven and pray
That we'll be back together someday, hey Tonight I need your sweet caress
Tonight you calm my restlesness
Tonight I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness
As I watch you
across the moonlit room
There's so much tenderness in your loving
Tomorrow I must leave
And dawn knows no reprieve
