Why you mad?

Talking about you mad
Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had
That's your bag
Yup that's too bad
Show is over you ain't gotta act
Name hold weight like kilos

Boy you acting so corny like Fritos
Wouldn't have none of that without me, though
Ain't none of my business, this tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game you a free throw
It's nothing that you don't already know
Close the door, lose the key
