With time to kill and an empty tomb
I always find a way to pass the time with you
Dark and smoky rooms, I can hardly stand the fumes

Telling me that you mean no harm
You stand me up like a crutch, another arm
But only when I'm gone have I been away too long

No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong
