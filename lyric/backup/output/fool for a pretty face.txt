Alright...

Well you tell me you want me
You say that you really care
Don't you tell me no lies
When you leave me, honey
You're gonna have a cross to bear

For there's two kinds of people I just can't stand
That's a lyin' woman or a beggin' man
Ain't nobody else gonna take my place
'Cause I'm just a fool for a pretty face
