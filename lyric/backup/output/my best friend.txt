I never had no one
That I could count on
I've been let down so many times
I was tired of hurtin'
So tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life

It was a feelin' I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
