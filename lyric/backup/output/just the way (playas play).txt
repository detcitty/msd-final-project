Just the way playas play)
(Every day, all day)
Yeah, playas play

(Just the way playas play)
(Every day, all day)
Oh, yeah

I've been hustling hard all week
So my pockets are tight
I gots to kick it tonight

There's a party going on
I know it's gonna be jumping
I called the V.I.P.
And let em know I'm coming

Now I'll be there
In the freshest wear
It ain't nothing
But a thing to me

I just wanna have a good time
Relax my mind
And maybe creep
With something fine

You know, you know
(Just the way playas play)
Playas play
(Every day, all day)
Now you know how we do it
