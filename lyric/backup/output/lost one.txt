It's not a diss song, it's just a real song
Feel me?

I heard *** sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, "Okay, so make another Hov"
*** wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo

I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends, business interests as they go
Ain't nothin' left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came fo'

I shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a *** but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow *** up off him

And I ain't even want to be famous
*** is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I don't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man

It's stronger than heroin
