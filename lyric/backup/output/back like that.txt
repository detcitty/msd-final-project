[Intro: Ne-yo (GhostFace Killah)]
It's your boy Ne-Yo we're gonna do it like this,
[Kanye West] The Roc is in the building!
I keep telling them the Master Don is in the building
Kanye West is in the building,
Ghostface
your getting fat now.
(Its the remix got the fat stomach I'm laid up
Eating good now,
I got good girl now
other girl all stressed out,
my shorty got that fat ass
shorty mad pulling her hair out... )

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz,
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends,
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that.
Flossin' around, when I'm up in these streets,
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef,
(Ok girl) what I did was wack
But you don't get your nigga back like that, no

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Pardon me if I lost my voice
I just got off stage, I'm in Japan right now, sidebar

I'm high powered put Eva Mendes to sleep,
The part, that bitch been on my mind all week.
But back to this mack loss chick, your waist thick
How you have everything in this world and waste it?
Quince told me it'll be okay,
I'm so sick like Ne-Yo say, I'm laid back like neo soul,
I holla back at this Creole hoe,
She from the N.O. but she never told me N-O so
We hit the spot to chill, where the food get grilled,
She order the Kobe beef like Shaquille O'Neal
