Four years, you'd think for sure
That's all you've got to endure
All the total dicks
All the stuck-up chicks
So superficial
So immature
And then when you graduate
You take a look around and you say
HEY WAIT
This is the same as where I just came from

I thought it was over
Oh that's just great!
The whole damn world
Is just as obsessed
With who's the best dressed
And who's having sex
Who's got the money
Who gets the honeys
