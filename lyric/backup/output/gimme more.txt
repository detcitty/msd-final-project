It's Britney, bitch

(I see you)
(And I just want to dance with you)
Every time they turn the lights down
Just want to go that extra mile for you

You public display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room (But you)
We can get down like there's no one around
We'll keep on rockin' (We'll keep on rockin')
We'll keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'
They keep watching (They keep watching)

Keep watching
Feels like the crowd is saying
Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme more
Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme, More
Gimme, Gimme more

Gimme, More
