Penny lover
Don't walk on by
Penny lover
Don't you make me cry
Can't you see girl who my heart's beating for
You're the only girl that I adore
The first time I saw you
Oh, you look so fine
And I had a feeling
One day you'd be mine
Honey you came along and captured my heart
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm all alone it's you that I miss
Girl a love like yours is hard to resist
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, oh
Penny lover
My love's on fire
Penny lover
You're my one desire
Tell me baby could this be true
That I could need someone like I need you
Nights warm and tender
(oohm)
Lying next to you
