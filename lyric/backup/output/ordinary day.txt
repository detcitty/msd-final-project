Just a day, just an ordinary day
Just trying to get by
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but
He was looking to the sky and
As he asked, if I would come along
I started to realize
That everyday he finds, just what he's lookin' for
Like a shooting star, he shines
And he said

Take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right
In the palm of your hand
