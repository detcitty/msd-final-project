The days and nights you sit around wondering where can
she be
Hoping that she might appear, out of nowhere
But you fail to see

All the hurt inside, the wounded pride
Ooh what she went through for you
You cheated and lied, as her love slowly died
And her heart just broke in two

When she was with you, all along
Behind you right or wrong
She tried to hold on, hold on
But you went too far, and she's gone

And now it's over and her heart turns to stone
