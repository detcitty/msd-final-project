Like sunshine and rain
Like sunshine and rain
Well I'm the new kid, I'm just comin' up
A lot of rappers think that I can't tear it up
Well I'm 'a show 'em and ignore 'em
And when they think I ain't lookin' I floor 'em
I mean take 'em out I keep groovin'
A slick bass line keep the beat movin'
They can't take it they just fake it
They wonder how the Rob Base make it
I get I'll, you know the deal
Cause this is how the Rob Base feels
Like sunshine and rain
Like sunshine and rain
I keep smokin', hot like fire
You had the turn, now retire
