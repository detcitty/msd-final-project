Hello world, hope you're listening
Forgive me if I'm young or speaking out of turn
But there's someone I've been missing
And I think that they could be the better half of me

They're in the wrong place tryin' to make it right
But I'm tired of justifying

So I say to you, come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for ya for so long, for so long
