Summer stretching on the grass
Summer dresses pass
In the shade of a willow tree
Creeps a crawling over me
Over me and over you
Stuck together with God's glue
It's going to get stickier too
It's been a long hot summer
Let's get undercover
Don't try too hard to think
Don't think at all
I'm not the only one
Starin' at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find
If you took a look inside
Not just deaf and dumb
Staring at the sun
Not the only one
