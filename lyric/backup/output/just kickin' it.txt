Every man wants a woman,
Where him and her can just go hang.
Just the two of them alone, kick back,
Doing their own thing.
And every man wants a woman,
That can always keep him in the mood.
And I'm that kind of girl,
So this is what I tell my dude.

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.
