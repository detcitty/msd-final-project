The greatest romance that's ever been sold.

So whadda ya know U and me
Finally face 2 face
Checkin' each other up and down
In all the obvious places
Was there ever a reason
4 us 2 be apart?
The air that fills up this room
Say's not hardly

So this is where u end
And U and I begin
(This is where U and I, U and I begin)
The greatest romance thats ever been sold
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
