Baby, there's no need to tell ya, as far as I can clearly recall
My love has been here for you so you don't have to worry at all
I'll sacrifice my time, I'll make sure you're satisfied
And it's no hard thing to the joy I'll bring, I wanna give you all of my love

Said I'm loving you, loving you every day
(I'm loving you)
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
(Love without a limit)
Said I'm loving you, loving you every day
(I'm loving you, boy)
Don't you look no more, love without a limit
You know, you know

Ooh baby, I'm in need of your love and you got that touch
That I need so much and I am about to explode
Freely, completely, everything you want I'll be
Good love down to the last drop and I'm not gonna stop
