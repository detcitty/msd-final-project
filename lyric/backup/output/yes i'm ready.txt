I don't even know how to love you
Just the way you want me to
But I'm ready (Ready) to learn (To learn)
Yes, I'm ready (Ready) to learn (To learn)

To fall in love, to fall in love
To fall in love with you

Oho, baby

I don't even know how to hold your hand
Just to make you understand
But I'm ready (Ready) to learn (To learn)
Yes, I'm ready (Ready) to learn (To learn)
