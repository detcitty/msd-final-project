She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there that
She'd be discovered someday.

So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them
As she brought them to their feet.

Chorus:
She was a big star
At Banana Joe's bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spot light
