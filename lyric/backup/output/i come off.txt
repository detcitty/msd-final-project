Hey, yeah yeah
You got it goin' on
Oh na na, na na

Now I wrote this record for when I perform
On the nights inside a university dorm
I put pen to paper, with the paper to pen
For the times I'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men

I get raw like Eddie, rough like Freddie
Kruger with a Luger turning men into spaghetti
I'm like Fats Domino, off of Blueberry Hill
Because my rhymes are funky-fresh and not run of the mill
So like a king has palaces, I give an analysis
You can't talk because you're suffering paralysis
If the mouth, of the lip, of the tongue
Coming to you compliments of a brother named Young
Now you can't talk because I'm leaving you speechless
So be quiet, let an educator teach this
I speak to my producer so he's in a rage
So like he controls the vinyl, I control the stage
Cuz I come off
Yo, I come off
