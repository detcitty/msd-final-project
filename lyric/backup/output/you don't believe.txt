My eyes with your vision
My choice but always your decision
My play with your direction
Well, it's my lead but always your connection

But when I look into your eyes, you don't believe me
I can see it in your eyes, you don't believe

My words, your expression
My land always your possession
My song, your production
My expense is always your deduction
