Like ships in the night
You keep passing me by
Just wasting time
Trying to prove who's right
And if it all goes crashing into the sea
If it's just you and me
Trying to find the light

Like ships in the night letting cannonballs fly
Say what you mean and it turns to a fight
Fists fly from my mouth as it turns south
You're down the driveway

I'm on the couch
Chasing your dreams since the violent fifth grade
Trying to believe in your silent own way
Cause we'll be okay, I'm not going away

Like you watched at fourteen as you went down the drain
Your pop's stayed the same and your mom's moved away
How many of our parents seem make it anyway
We're just fumbling through the gray

Trying to find a heart that's not walking away
Turn the lights down low
