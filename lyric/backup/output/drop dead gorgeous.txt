Yeah, yeah
Backward words, he got 'em
Shut up, I'm talkin'
This time, you'll listen
But when I look at you, you're forgiven

You drive too fast and
I smoke too much and
My heart is broken
But when I look at you, you're forgiven
You're forgiven

I know my ex-boyfriend lies
Oh, he does it every time
It's just his permanent disguise
Yeah, yeah but he's drop dead gorgeous

Don't go changin' every time
