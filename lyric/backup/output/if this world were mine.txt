If this world were mine
I would place at your feet
All that I own
You've been so good to me
If this world were mine

I'd give the flowers the birds and the bees
And it'd be your love beside me
That would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give anything

If this world were mine
I would make you a king
With wealth untold
You could have anything
If this world were mine

I'd give your each day so sunny and blue
