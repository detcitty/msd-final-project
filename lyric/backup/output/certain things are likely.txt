(Hey, mister, hey mister)

A world
(Hey, mister, hey mister)
(Hey, mister, hey mister)

I've got my world
Why should I think about the rain falling?
Inside lookin' outside
Tryin' to put one foot in Eden (Eden, Eden)

Come stay, you stay
Try looking sideways, try looking other ways
Imagine how I must be feeling
And each time I pray
I wonder which way I should be meaning

(Hey, mister, hey mister)
One step
One step away from you
I'm only one step
One step away from you

Hold on a minute!
