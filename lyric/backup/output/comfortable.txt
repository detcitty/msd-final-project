Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby, just be comfortable
I'll be right here next to you

Hey shawty what it do, what's happenin'?
Peep the way you move I can tell you make it happen
I see you walking around like your feet don't hurt
Shawty just cold like the heat don't work
She independent, you be ballin' on the budget
She ridin' in the fly's all the real niggas love it
Money making mission she just steady chasin' duckets
Shawty, she ain't playin' she just ballin', Denver Nugget

G5 fly, lord oh my
Can't help to stare, everytime you walk by
You got thang for a nigga I can see it in your eye
What I gotta do for a piece of a pie
Tell me you feelin' alright
I'm tryna get with you tonight
