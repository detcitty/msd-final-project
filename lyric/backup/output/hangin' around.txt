Drivin' along with my radio on feelin' good
Ain't got no lady but maybe I'm thinkin' I could
I slept all day nothing to do
And I don't see the world goin' by
And I don't even have to try
I'm just hangin' around (Oh yeah)

Thought I was cool when I dropped out of school it was great (yeah)
Could have gone crazy but I was too lazy to wait
