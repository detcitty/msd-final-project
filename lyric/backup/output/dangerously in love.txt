I love you
I love you
I love you

Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome

You are my raindrop

I am the seed
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud

So proud to be your girl
You make the confusion

Go all away
From this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing

Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me
Cause I am in love with you

You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
