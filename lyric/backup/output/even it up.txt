I am the one who can please you, ain't that what you said?
You seemed so alone, I guess I was easily led
I showed you my love and babe, I guess that it went to your head
When you were hungry I brought you your breakfast in bed

Come on, even it up, even it up, even it up
Come on, even it up, even it up, even it up
