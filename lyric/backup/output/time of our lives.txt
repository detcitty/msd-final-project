I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get up in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby
Ooh give me the time of my life
Let's get it now

This is the last $20 I got
But I'm a have a good time ballin' or out
Tell the bartender line up some shots
Cause I'm a get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her I wanna ride out, and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed
