(Gonna hit it)
Ski-doody-doom-da-nah
(Oh yeah)
Ski-doody-doom-da-nah
Ski-doody-doom-da-nah
(Oh yeah)

Bottoms up, it's too hot in here
Where's the fire truck when you need o-one
I want a firm foundation, a knockout derriere
I can't believe that my eyes are gaspin' for air

Unlike before, so much to explore
