It's nine o'clock on a saturday
Regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

He says son can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes

La-la-la de-de da
La-la de-de da da-da

Sing us a song you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well we're all in the mood for a melody
