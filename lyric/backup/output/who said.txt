I'm more than just
Your average girl
I'd like to turn me up
And show the world
Aw, yea
'Cuz some can talk the talk
But this girl just wants to rock
I'm individual
I'm not like anyone
I can be glamorous
Just like you see in all the magazines
I can be cool as ice
Or anything I wanna be
Who said, who said
I can't be Superman?
I say, I say
That I know I can
Who said, who said
