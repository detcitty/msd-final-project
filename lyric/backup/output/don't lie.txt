Yeah, uh huh
La da da da da da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

Hey, baby my nose is getting big?
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's getting weaker
Probably cuz my lies just started getting deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
Fuckin' with your heart like I was the Predator
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
Cuz what you did to me I did to you

No, no, no, no baby
No, no, no, no don't lie
Cuz no, no, no, no, yeah
You know, know, know, know, you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out?
When I really see you, what you're all about?
