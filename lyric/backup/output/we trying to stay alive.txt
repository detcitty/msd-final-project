(Wy-Clef Jean)

We got the Refugees All-Stars rubba dubbin' in the club
Wyclef Jean, John Forte, Prizewell.
Nah mean the streets are gettin a little crazy.
Looka looka looka looka looka
looka looka looka here looka shorty got back
should I ask her for a dance hold on theres too many in a wolf pack
and besides Dirtycash talkin to her
buyin' her fake furs and takin' her to the fever
quite as his kept that ain't even his Benz
she spends his franklins at the malls with her friends
material girl, livin' in a material world
but it's alright cause its Saturday night
so mista funkmaster pump the Bee-Gees
and all you college students bring your ouijas'
check the spellin, R E--F U G E--E get the cd from Sam Goody he he
You ain't even close wit the rhymes that you wrote
Don't be mad cause you broke
let me clear my throat ah huh ah huh
John Forte grab the mic roots sway it this way

(John Forte)

I more than just a rhymer you still a small timer
