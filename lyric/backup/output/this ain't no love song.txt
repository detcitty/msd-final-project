Well my heart didn't skip a beat
When I saw you standing there
Lookin' like some kinda angel
Like you were walking on air

And the earth didn't move
When you first said my name, I didn't feel a thing
No, not me
My heart didn't skip a beat

This ain't no love song
I just felt like getting my guitar on
And singing a tune, singing about you, yeah
Feeling good and tapping my shoes
