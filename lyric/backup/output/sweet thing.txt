I will love you any way
even if you can not stay
I think you are the one for me
here is where you ought to be
I just want to satisfy ya
though you're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking baby
love me now or I'll go crazy

woah oh sweet thing
don't you know you're my everything
whah oh sweet thing
Oh you know you're my everything
yes you are
