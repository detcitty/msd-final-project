Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa

(This is everything I didn't say)

Wait, don't tell me
Heaven is a place on earth
I wish I could rewind all
the times that I didn't
show you what you're really worth
(What you're really worth)

The way that you held me
I wish that I'd put you first
I was wrong I admit
Numb from your kiss
While you were slipping through my fingertips

Taking every breath away
With all of the mistakes I've made
From all the letters that I've saved
