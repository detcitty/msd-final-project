Well don't worry about the damage done
Just let those words roll off your tongue
Even if you're lying.

If you really don't mean it I don't care
If you need a little buzz to get you there
Then baby I'm buying.

Well couldn't you
Say you do
Say you might
For tonight
Have a heart
Bend the truth even if you don't
Couldn't you mess me up get in my head
