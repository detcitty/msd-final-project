Higher, higher
Fire

Don't change your style now that you've reached the top
Don't choose your friends by what they've got
Remember beneath the glitter and gleam
Like everyday people you're just a human being

Superstar, good God
Enjoy your champagne and caviar
And your chauffeur drivin' fancy car
But remember how you got where you are
Oh ho ho, 'cause the same folks that made you
Um hum, you better believe they can break you
