Well, I sat down in front of my TV set
And some man said this is what you get
Only a dollar a week and a dollar down
You can drive this car anywhere in this town

You can take it on the highway, check the tires
Leave it in the driveway and check out the wires
If that ain’t just what your heart desires
I tell you what I’m going to do

Take it on a ten day trial
And if you don’t like what you see
