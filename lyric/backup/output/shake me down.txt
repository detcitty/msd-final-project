Shake me down
Not a lot of people left around
Who knows now
Softly laying on the ground, ooooh

Not a lot people left around, ooooh. ooooh
In my life, I have seen
People walk into the sea
Just to find memories

Plagued by constant misery

Their eyes cast down
Fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down
