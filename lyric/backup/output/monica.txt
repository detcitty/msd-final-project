M O N I C A
Trying to take my man away from me
(Ooh)
M O N I C A
She trying to take my man away from me, uh

Monica, Monica
Stalking and hawking and jocking
And she follow ya, what she don't know
Is that I went and followed ya
Somebody gotta let her know

Monica, Monica
Stalking and hawking and jocking
And she follow ya, what she don't know
Is that I went and followed ya
So, I'm about to let her know

First time she paged you
I let it slide, huh
But then he went behind my back
And let her spend the night

I went out of town, so she thought
So she thought
I caught the chicken at the crib with my nuh
They knew that they were caught

What do I do? What do I say?
(Do, Say)
How should I feel? I'm ready to blaze
You got me ready to blaze

Monica, Monica
