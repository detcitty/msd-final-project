Sitting in a bus stop
Singing silly songs

I'm lying awake
Your voice makes me shake
Singing songs I can stand more
The shower runs dry
But I don't know why
You're still singing like mad

[CHORUS]
Silly Milly, you nearly kill me
Now why don't you thrill me
My love is still strong but maybe
Silly Milly, if you're still trying
