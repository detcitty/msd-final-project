Highfly, touch the sky,
Whatcha gonna do now the well's dry?
Good time, feeling fine.
Whatcha gonna do now there's no wine?

For many years
You played the joker and you always won.
You wasted time,
Always fooling round and having fun.
Your luck ran out
Just like the sunshine when the day is done.
Your dreams subsided
