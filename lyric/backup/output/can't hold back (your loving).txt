Come to me she calls me (i really need your lovin')
Come to me i need you (right now)
Come to me oh baby (i wanna feel your lovin')
Come to me i want you (right now)

She's got what it takes / she can pin you to the floor
She knows just what she'll do to you
She's dynamite dynamite

You can't hold back don't fall for her she's coming
You just can't hold back your lovin'
(you know you can't resist her)

You can't hold back don't fall for her she's coming
You just can't hold back your lovin'

Come to me she calls me (i really need your lovin')
Come to me i need you (right now)
Come to me oh baby (i wanna feel your lovin')
