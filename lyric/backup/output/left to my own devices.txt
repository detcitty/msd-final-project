I get out of bed at half past ten
phone up a friend who's a party animal
Turn on the news and drink some tea
Maybe if you're with me we'll do some shopping

One day I'll read or learn to drive a car
If you pass the test, you can beat the rest
but I don't like to compete or talk street, street, street
I can pick up the best from the party animal

I could leave you
say good-bye
or I could love you
if I try
and I could
and left to my own devices
I probably would
Left to my own devices
I probably would

Pick up a brochure about the sun
Learn to ignore what the photographer saw
I was always told that you should join a club
stick with the gang if you want to belong

I was a lonely boy, no strength, no joy
in a world of my own at the back of the garden
I didn't want to compete or play out on the street
for in a secret life I was a Roundhead general

I could leave you
say good-bye
