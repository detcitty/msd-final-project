Whatz Happenin' Homie This The Lil'wo Plies Man
Hey Pain Tell 'em
Bout Your Shawty I'm a Tel Em Bout Mine

Even Though I'm Not Your Man, You Not My Girl
I'm a Call You My Shawty
Cause I Can't Stand To See You Treated Bad
I Beat His Ass For My Shawty
And We Ain't Did Nothin That We Ain't Supposed To Do
Cause You My Shawty
Babygirl You Know I Be Home, Keep Me On The Ringtone Shawty
Sing It To Me Girl

Soon As I Seen Her, Shit Told Her I'd Pay For It
Lil Mama The Baddest Thing 'round Here & She Already Know It
I Pointed At The Donk & Told Her This Supposed To Be Yours
Showed Her A Couple Stacks & Told Her I'd Let Her Blow It
The Hottest Nigga In The City Baby You Can't Ignore It
I Showed Her I Was A Real Nigga & She Went For It
