There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky it's the colour of love
There must have been an angel by my side

Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you he led me to you
He built a bridge to your heart all the way
How many tons of love inside I can't say

When I was led to you I knew you were the one for me
I swear whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
