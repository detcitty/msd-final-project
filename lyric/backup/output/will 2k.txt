It's here and I like it
Ooh! Ha-ha! Ha-ha!
Big Will, K-Ci, y'all bringing it in
What?

It's here and I like it
Say what? What?
Say what? What?
Gonna pack the dance floor
And do what with it?
Rock the dance floor

Here it comes the party of a lifetime
31st of December
Man, I remember when the ball dropped for 90
Now it's 9-9, ten years behind me

Whats gonna happen? Don't nobody know
Well, see when the clock gets to 12-0-0
Chaos, the cops gonna block the street
Man who the hell cares? Just don't stop the beat

No time to sleep, yo it's on tonight
K-C, you feeling me right?
2-0-0-0
Will 2K

The new millennium, yo excuse me Willennium
It cant get thicker than this Big Will
Slick like Rick, I can't miss
And we gonna party like its 19, hold up it is

Here it comes, another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
