Driving faster than you want me to
Can't help myself when I'm alone with you
Alright
Alright

I've passed the limit and there's no way back
Your kind of love gives me a heart attack
Alright
Alright

'Cuz baby can't you see
We need to spend some time alone
We need to see some dreams come true
I wanna feel me touching you
We need a midnight rendezvous
