Shake it up

I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly

I got lost

In the sounds
I hear in my mind
All of these voices
I hear in my mind
All of these words
I hear in my mind
All of this music
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my ha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aart

And it breaks my ha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-aart
Suppose I never, ever met you
