I believe I can see the future
'Cause I repeat the same routine
I think I used to have a purpose
Then again, that might have been a dream

I think I used to have a voice
Now I never make a sound
And I just do what I've been told
I really don't want them to come around, oh no

Every day is exactly the same
Every day is exactly the same
