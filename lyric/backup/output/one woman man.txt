Alright, (hmm)
It's so funny runnin' into you
It has to be three years
Since we last seen each other
Many flashbacks come to mind
Of the wild and crazy times
We used to have with one another

We absolutely didn't care
We would do it anywhere
Eye contact, and it was over, hmm
But that's when I was wild, and now
I couldn't care less about
