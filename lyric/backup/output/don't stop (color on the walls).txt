Walk little walk Small talk big thoughts
Gonna tell them all just what I want
That Street two streets I see you and me
Hanging on the empty of swings
'Count high low don't worry my eyes are closed
Im a superman and it's my show
One shoe two gonna kick with My new shoes
Im going to kick until I need new shoes

Yeah, Yeah
I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Talking to me
Stop don't stop don't stop
Giving me things

I run they run everybody run run
And we're all just having fun
