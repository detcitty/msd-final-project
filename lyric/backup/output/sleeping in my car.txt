I'll tell you what I've done
I'll tell you what I'll do
Been driving all night
just to get close to you
Baby babe - I'm moving so fast
you'd better come on

The moon is alright
the freeway's heading south
My heart is going boom
there's a strange taste in my mouth
Baby babe - I'm moving real fast
so try to hold on

Try to hold on!

Sleeping in my car
I will undress you
Sleeping in my car
I will caress you
