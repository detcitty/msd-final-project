James Dean, James Dean
I know just what you mean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen

You were the low-down rebel if there ever was
Even if you had no cause
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen
