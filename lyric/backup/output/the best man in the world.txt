You've been taken by the city
The oldest story in the world
You come for the gold
And end up bought and sold

You can't seem
To make no difference
With all the lies
That you've been told

What you don't know is you're
The best man in the world

There's more than meets the eye
There's so much you don't see
Like the power of your heart
