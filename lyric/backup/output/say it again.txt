It gives me such a thrill
When you tell me 'bout the way you feel
It really makes my day
I just love to hear you say

Say it again, say it high, say it low
Say it again, so the whole wide world will know
Say it, that you're still lovin' me
Still lovin' me, still in love with me

You know it sounds so sweet
It just knocks me right up off of my feet
