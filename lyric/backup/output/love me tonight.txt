Drive 200 hundred miles
To a place I've never seen
One more walk back to the car and I come
Even before I know where I've been, yeah

Well, I don't know where you come from
Probably never see your face again
It really don't matter what your name is
But its so nice to make another friend

Well, I don't know, where you've been
And I don't know who you've had in
But I know you've got exactly
What I need

It don't mean to much to me
What you do or who you see
I'll be leaving here at 3: 00
So love me tonight

Well I've been gone a long time
Really haven't been any place at all
