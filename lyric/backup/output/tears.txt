You left me here alone
I guess I'll never see the light
You turned another's thumb
And he makes your wrongs
Seem right
Out on some different wavelength
Somehow he brings you more
But sweetheart tonight
I know for sure
I'll see those tears
The damage they do
You're breaking my heart with those tears
I'll cry over you
Can we make a new start
