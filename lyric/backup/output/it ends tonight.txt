Your subtleties
They strangle me, I can't explain myself at all
And all the wants
And all the needs all I don't want to need at all
The walls start breathing, my minds unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone

A weight is lifted
On this evening
I give the final blow

When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight
It ends tonight

A falling star
Least I fall alone
I can't explain what you can't explain
