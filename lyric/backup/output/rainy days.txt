Musical thing called the rainy days
 Specially designed not to make you go astray, you know
 
 Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out there
 Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong
 Rainy days, rainy rainy rainy out deh
 Song dong dong dong dong dong dong dong
 
 Drink one beer den me sit down 'pon de sofa
 Look outside it was raining all over
 Go in the other rom and den me put on the fire
 Through me did cold and me body a shiver
 Likkle after dat I said I started to wonder
 Three hours gone and de rain jus' a thunder
 All de time me jus look pon de dark sky
 Hurry up and bring back de sun fe I!
