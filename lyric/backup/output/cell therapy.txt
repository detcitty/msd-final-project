When the scene unfolds young girls
Thirteen years old expose themselves
To any Tom, Dick and Hank
Got mo' stretch marks than these hoes hollin they got rank
See Sega aint in this new world order
Dem experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas they trained assassins
to do search and seize aint knocking or askin'
Dem coming for niggas like me Po' white trash, like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps laced with gas pipes lines
Inferno's outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me later on
In the future, look it up where they said it
Aint no more constitution in the event of a race war
Places like operation heartbreak hotel moments tear
until air tight vents seat off despair
Dem say expect no mercy, fool
You should be my least worries, gotta deal with W-2's,
1099's unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

Who's that peeking in my window
POW nobody now
