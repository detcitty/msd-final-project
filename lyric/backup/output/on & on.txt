Oh my my my
I'm feeling high
My moneys gone
I'm all alone
to much toooooo say
The world keeps turnin'
Oh what a day
What a day what a day

Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learn
If your knowledge were your wealth then it would be well earned

If we were made in his image then call us by our names
