These are strange days we live in
The nights get even worse
The poets died at midnight 
In a New York City hearse... 
And the news must make you crazy
It has for so long
And the streets are full of fear tonight 
And coming on strong... 

You know, they're holed-up in Atlanta
Broke down in L.A.
They went and sold out Detroit
