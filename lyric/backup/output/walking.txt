Tell me what you see when I pass by
Shadow, a cloud or a line in the sky
Am I getting it wrong or am I getting it right?
Well all I can take is one, one step at the time

Look at me, I'm trying
Every day, I fall down
Make mistakes, get back up
Try again next time that you see me

I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking
