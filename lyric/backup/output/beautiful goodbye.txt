Tell me you love me
I know u don't
I know u don't
Tell me you still want me
Oh I know u don't
Know u don't no more-
no more, no more, no more

My heart is crazy frustrated
I can't hold onto you, who is leaving me

I know it's too late
oh once again
I only have late regrets
I'm just talking to myself
Saying words that are too late
But I hope
You'll listen to my last request oh girl

A beautiful goodbye, a beautiful goodbye
For what we had was nothing,
Nothing but a beautiful,
