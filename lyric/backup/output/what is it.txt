Bash, tell me, what it do
Tell me, what it do, Kingston
(What is it)
What, what, what is it
Hey, hey, hey, hey

What is it
Let me see you go mama, go mama
What is it
Get your girls and pull on her show, mama
What is it
Get it on the floor and dip it low, mama
What is it, what, what, what is it, what is it

What is it
Let me see you go mama, go mama
What is it
Get your girls and pull on her show, mama
What is it
Get it on the floor and dip it low, mama
What is it, what, what, what is it, what is it

I'm a holler back, then I pop my collar back
Girl, I see that da, da, da, dunk, I want all of that, follow that
Train man, follow that caboose
Ain't nathin' in the world like some thick and some juicy

She going downtown 'cause her favorite DJ's spinnin'
I'm all up in the door, so I'm already winnin'
I got a lot of women, but I'm way too choosy
And then I love my cake, like that Ricky love Lucy

On some peanut butter leather, with the wood so grainy
It must be raining dollars 'cause she lookin' so gravy
Sophisticated lady, pop it to the end, what it do, what the busi'
