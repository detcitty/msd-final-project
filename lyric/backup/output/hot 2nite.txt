Ooh, all right
Hey yeah, NE keep it hot for ya

Verse 1:
Ronnie – Now let me set it off in the right way
You got a bangin' booty and a tight waste
I been a fan since I met you in the lobby
And hopefully you'll run up over my place

Ralph – I can't belive I never saw you comin' over
Until you put your pretty hand up on my shoulder
I wanna touch, I wanna kiss, I wanna hold ya
Yeah, I really wanna get ya hot tonight

Ricky - So tell me what I gotta do to
Get the hook up in the future
Baby you choose the night, whatever you like
And Imma pick you up on time

Johnny – And it's cool if you don't want to
But you'll be a fool if you don't want to
