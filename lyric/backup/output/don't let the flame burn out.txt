You gave me something
I never had
And, baby, I can feel
The change in me

But you can't say
How long you'll stay around
I guess I'll just have
To wait and see

Nobody said it was easy
To get the love that you need
But the one who is giving
Is the one who receives

Oh, baby, don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
Cause light's a sweet emotion
