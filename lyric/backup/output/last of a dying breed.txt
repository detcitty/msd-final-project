Oww, Luda!
I done killed so many niggaz in the booth I sell rappers on eBay
Cause every one of mys been instant like replays
Speakers get blown like candles on yo' B-day
Cause Luda's catalog got mo' records than the DJ

The bank yells "mayday" cause every day's a payday
I put it on tape and then I'll sell it like Ray J
But not out the sto', nope, straight to the buyer
Cause I slung 'em out my trunk like the D.C. sniper

And six albums later you'll deposit every word
'Til your memory bank gives me the credit I deserve
Top 5, damn right! But really it just hit me
That three of yo' top 5's too scared to fuck with me

So how can I advance if you don't give me no opponents?
How can you see the future if you livin' for the moment?
Hip-Hop couldn't die, I never offer my condolence
But I'll offer y'all a day of atonement, cause

I'm a lyricist to the death, so I got what you need
Ludacris, I'm the last of a dyin' breed
And we almost extinct, so I'm sayin' it loud
