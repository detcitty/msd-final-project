Anything I Want...
Anything I Want...

People always sayin' what you can and cannot do
Well listen to me people I just do what I want to
I cannot justify a man with the power
To decide if and when I come down off my tower

I know with the power from above
I can make it work for me when it comes to push and shove
I know from the talk upon the street
I can make a difference in who I meet
