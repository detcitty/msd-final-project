He was a famous trumpet man out Chicago way
He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft, but then his number came up
And he was gone with the draft, he's in the army now a blowin' reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B

They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he could not jam
The captain seemed to understand
