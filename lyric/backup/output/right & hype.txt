Right, the hype
Right, the hype...

Right, hype
Right, hype, yeah
Right, hype
Right, hype

I've been looking for a
I've been looking for the right guy
I've been searching here and there
But there still was no one there
For me, for me

There's nothing so sweeter
There's nothing so fine
Than to have a girl like me

One who's so precious
One who's so dear
I need a man and he's
Got to be right

Right, hype
Who can love me all night love
Right, hype
Who never treats me wrong
Right, hype
One who's so real
Right, hype
Who knows the deal

No need to play me out
