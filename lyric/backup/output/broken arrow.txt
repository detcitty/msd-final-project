(Chorus)
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There he goes moving across the water
There he goes turning my whole world around

Do you feel what I feel
Can we make it so that's part of the deal
I've gotta hold you in these arms of steel
Lay your heart on the line, this time
