Rob the jewelry store an' tell 'em make me a grill
Add the whole top diamond an' the bottom row's gold
Yo, we 'bout to start a epidemic wit this one
Y'all know what this is, So So Def
Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 mo' at the top
All invisible set an' little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum an' white gold, traditional gold
I'm changin' grillz er'rday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely, in my white tee
Or on South Beach, in my wife B
V V an' studded, you can tell when they cut it
Ya see my grandmama hate it but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin'
Eyes stay low from the cheifin'
I got a grill they call Penny Candy, you know what that means
It look like Now n' Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothin', only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in ya city, somewhere out in ya hood, just say
Smile fo' me, Daddy, what you lookin' at?
Let me see ya grill, let me see my what
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Rob the jewelry store an' tell 'em to make me a grill
Smile fo' me, Daddy, what you lookin' at?
