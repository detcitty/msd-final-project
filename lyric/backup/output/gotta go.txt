(Intro)
Good evening
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out
Hope your flights were safe
Feeling real breezey
Swift like the wind

(Verse One)
It's calling my body
It's calling my soul
It's calling my mind
So girl I gotta go
Baby it's the grind
Yes I had a good time
(Don't get me wrong) You were so good
And I really wish I could
Stay a little bit longer
Love you a little bit stronger
And go a little deeper
Baby with you
But since this thang is calling I
Gotta answer dry your eyes
Girl don't cry
'Cause your making it hard for me

(Chorus)
'Cause I don't want to leave (Ooo girl)
