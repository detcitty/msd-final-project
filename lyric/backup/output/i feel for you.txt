Chaka, Chaka, Chaka

Chaka Khan
Chaka Khan

Chaka Khan let me rock you
Let me rock you Chaka Khan
Let me rock you
That's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan let me rock you
Let me rock you Chaka Khan
Let me rock you
Let me feel for you
Chaka Khan won't you tell me what you wanna do
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you?
Chaka Khan let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
Let me take you in my arms
Let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
'Cause you know that I'm the one
To keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make it more than just a physical dream
I wanna rock you, Chaka, baby
