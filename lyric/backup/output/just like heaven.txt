"Show me, show me, show me, how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream," she said
"The one that makes me laugh," she said
And threw her arms around my neck

"Show me how you do it, and I promise you
I promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you"
Spinning on that dizzy edge

I kissed her face and kissed her head
