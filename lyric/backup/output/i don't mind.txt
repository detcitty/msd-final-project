Chorus:
Anything you want my baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy
So fine you're so fine
I don't mind
Girl I'll walk you home from school
Be your undercover fool
So fine you're so fine
I don't mind

Verse 1:
You can have anything
You took my heart and plus a ring
I just wanna see you smile
I think about you all the time
