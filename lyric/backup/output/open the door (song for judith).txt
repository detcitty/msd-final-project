Sometimes I remember the old days
When the world was filled with sorrow
You might have thought I was living
But I was all alone

In my heart
The rain was falling
The wind blew
The night was calling
Come back, come back
I'm all you've ever known

(CHORUS)
Open the door and come on in
I'm so glad to see you, my friend
You're like a rainbow
Coming around the bend
And when I see you happy
Well, it sets my heart free
