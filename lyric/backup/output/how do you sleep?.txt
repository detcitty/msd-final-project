Ohh oh, ohh oh, ohh oh, oh

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep? (how do you sleep?)

Tried my best at movin on, have yet to find a girl like you
See things now I didn't before, now wishin I had more time with you
How do you stay awake, knowin all I do is think of you?
All the things we thought about, then never will have done happen again
If I could just see you

If I had my way we would get you girl in your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

It's been about a year now
