God bless whoever sent you
I really really do
God bless whoever sent you
I really really do

You're much too beautiful
To be part of the human race
Whoever carved those features
On your angel face
If I put on a pedestal
Girl that's where you belong
I'm building my world around you
So please don't let me down

(God bless whoever sent you)
('Cause I really need you)
(God bless whoever sent you)
('Cause I really need you)
