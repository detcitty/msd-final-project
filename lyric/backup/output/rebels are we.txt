We are the rebels, baby
Rebels are we
We want to be free, my baby and me
Nevertheless, rebels are we

Life's a switch, don't let it play a trick on you
Try not to be fooled, be wise
Don't throw a fit, stay calm and you'll be cool
You'll find the solution right before your eyes

I know much more but now that I'm older
