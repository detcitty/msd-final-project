You better not raise your voice at me
You know I got a pimp degree
Pluto

Draco season with the bookbag
Backpack, got a little kick back
Hundreds on hundreds got a good batch
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back
You ain't never ever get you bitch back

Lamborghini doors, but I never stop
Fuck around got a nigga pissed off
Nice little thot got stiff arm
Did the Heisman on the hoe got the stiff arm
Fuck up that body like Tyson or Holyfield,
wo wo wo wo wo
A Couple of pills and I got my soda filled,
wo wo wo wo wo
Break out a sweat, I go head over heels for these meals,
wo wo wo wo wo wo
She thinks she the one, but to me she ain't nothing but a thrill
wo wo wo wo wo
I've been drippin' like a god with her
I been dodgin' all the fly what else
I been fillin' up garages what else
I gave her a French monage what else
Close your eyes eyes eyes
I'm about to slide slide slide
Wonder why why why
I stay in the sky sky sky
Pink Molly, let me dance with her
Freestylin', let me dance with her
Sky Dweller, it was sentimental
