You told me I was the one
The only one who got your head undone
And for a while I believed the line that you spun

But I've been looking at you
Looking closely at the things you do
I didn't see it the way you wanted me to

How how howzat
You messed about
I caught you out
Howzat
Now that I found where you're at
It's goodbye
Well howzat
It's goodbye
