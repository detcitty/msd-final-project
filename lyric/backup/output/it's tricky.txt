This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital
To rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky tricky, here we go

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky, it's tricky, tricky
(Tricky, tricky)
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky, tr-tr-tricky, tricky
(Trrrricky)

I met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said, "It's not that easy"
