Yeah
It's officially the biggest midget in the game
I don't know
Make way for the S-O-V!

Love me or hate me, it? s still an obsession
Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me then, thank you!
If you hate me then, you!

Love me or hate me, it? s still an obsession

I'm fat, I need to diet
No, in fact, I'm just too light
And I ain't got the biggest breastesses
But I write all the best disses
(Chuh-ching!)

I got hairy armpits
But I don't walk around like this
I wear a big baggy t-shirt
That hides that nasty shit

Ew, I never had my nails done
Bite them down until they're numb
I'm the one with the non-existent bum
Now I don't really give uh!

I'm missin' my shepherd's pie
