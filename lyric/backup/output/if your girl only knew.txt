Yeah, oh, here we go, like that oh
Yeah, oh, here we go, like that, oh
Yeah, oh, here we go, like that, oh
Yeah, oh, Aaliyah, sing

If your girl only knew
That you was trying to get with me
If your girl only knew
That you was dissin' her to talk to me

She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry

If your girl only knew
That I would want to kick it with you
