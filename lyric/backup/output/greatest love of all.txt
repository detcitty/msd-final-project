I believe the children are our future
Teach them well
And let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty
They possess inside

Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero

People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone
Who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
