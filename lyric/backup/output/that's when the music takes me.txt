That's when the music takes me
Takes to a brighter day
That's when the music takes me
Helpin' me to find my way

When the day is so long that I can't hold on
When I'm down and I think my hope is gone
Oooh, Yeah,
That's when the music takes me
Closer to a brighter daaaay
I can feel my soul explodin'
There's a good feelin'
Helpin' me to find my waaay
My, my, my way
