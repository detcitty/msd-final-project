Another day is going by
I'm thinking about you all the time
But you're out there
and I'm here waiting

And I wrote this better in my head
Cause so many things were left unsaid
But now you're gone
and I can't think straight

This could be the one last chance to make you understand yeah

I'd do anything
just to hold you in my arms,
to try to make you laugh.
Somehow I can't put you in the past.
I'd do anything
just to fall asleep with you.
Will you remember me?
