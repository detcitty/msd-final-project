[featuring slick rick]
Uhh once upon a time let's see if i remember
Back in january
Nah chill... it was december
True... cuz that's when l started his bid
Partied through the new year
January third he slid
Up until then yo l had it swell
Called him sweet pea like his name was pernell
He did the job money came with ease
Blowing outta town moving bricks and ki's
Him and his chick in forty g rides
Holding down fort like they bonnie n clyde
Luxury cars of all makes and models
New outfits everyday, downin' champagne by the bottle
Glass in the air (air)
Toast to my team (team)
Toast to my cream and the scotties that beam
While others fiend, i'm abouts da beamer
Think about your girl, just say what (say what!), i'm a dreamer
