Live every moment
Love every day
'Cause before you know it
Your precious time slips away

Live every moment
Love every day
'Cause if you don't you might
Just throw your love away

I walked for seven miles this mornin'
Footprints in the sand
Washed away without a warning
When the water hit the land

But I will walk on
'Til I can no longer stand
I'll take you by the hand

And we'll live every moment
Love every day
