I wanted everything for a little while
Why shouldn't I?
I wanted to know what it was like
But I pushed you too far
And you started laying down the law till I didn't love you anymore

Now you can pull a little bit
And there's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit but finally it's gonna break
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
