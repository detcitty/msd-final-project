Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed

Whatever colors
You have in your mind
I'll show them to you
And you'll see them shine

Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed

Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile

Until the break of day
Let me see you make him smile
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay, lady
Stay, lady, stay, lady
