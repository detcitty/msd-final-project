Tarzan wasn't a ladies' man
He'd just come along scoop 'em up under his arm
Like that, quick as a cat in the jungle

But Clark Kent, now there was a real gent
He would not be caught sittin' around in no jungle scape
Dumb as an ape doing nothing

Superman never made any money
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy
And sometimes I despair the world will never see
Another man like him
