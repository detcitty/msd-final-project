Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam

We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
Creepin' up and down, now
It's time for me to let it go
If you really wanna see what we can do for you
Send the crazy wildin' static sing it

Jam on 'cause Backstreets' got it
Come on now, everybody
