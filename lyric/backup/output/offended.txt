Meek Milly, Jeffery, woah


Yeah, yeah
Fuck is you talking bout? Bitch, you offended me
I just might go 'head and let this lil bitch suck my dick till it tickle me
I just might go 'head and mix me a Sprite with some lean like it's chemistry
Goddamn, I had four hoes at one time, they was drilling me
I heard the lil boy was plotting on killing me
Fuck 'round and lift up they soul like Lil Chino be wheelin'
I usually don't beg but I don't want the ceiling please
Oxycontin fucking kidneys up


Molly, my cup look like bath salt
And I'm too high horsed for asphalt
Therefore I'm in clouds from day to dark
They say that I changed, it's the cash fault
Pay everybody like a cash cow
I switch through the lanes like a NASCAR
The Rollie stainless, stainless
We young and rich and we dangerous
I'm at Piccadilly's with your missus, nigga
And the weed stinking like a chitlin, nigga
Bend the money down like a Philly, nigga
Make me catch you slipping then it's Christmas, nigga
The bulletproof can take a missile, nigga
I got benji on me and he cripping,nigga
I done wrapped the benji in the city, ho
I done wrapped the Bentley in the bity, nigga
Put a swimming pool in the living room
How I'm living, nigga, I ain't swimming, nigga
