Oo it must be magic
How inside your eyes
I see my destiny
Every time we kiss
I feel you breathe your love so deep inside of me
If the moon and stars should fall
They'd be easy to replace
I would lift you up to heaven
And you would take their place

Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
