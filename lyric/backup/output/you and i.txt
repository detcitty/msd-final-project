You and I, you and I
Sounds like a whole lotta fun
You and I, you and I
Sounds like it oughta be one
One good love affair
You and I, you and I
Sounds like the right combination
You and I, you and I
Sounds like a good creation
Baby, for a love affair
So let's give our love a chance
Together, we can make it grow
Build love's eternal fire
So the whole wide world will know
