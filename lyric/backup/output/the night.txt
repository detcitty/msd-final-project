Well, here comes the night
It's dark shadows passing over me
I've been feeling the chill
Ever since you been gone

I'm thinking of you, girl
Wondering if you're going
To return to me
Or was it a waste of time
All we've been through

When I'm all alone
I don't have someone I can run to
Baby, I ain't got no place to go

Don't you know that the night
Keeps moving on (keeps moving on)
Keeps getting colder and colder
The night, always too long
(Always too long) I keep
Looking over my shoulder

The night, I pray for the dawn
(Pray for the dawn)
Keeps getting colder and colder
