If I had the chance to make love to you again
I'd hold you in my arms and I'd never let it end

I'm feeling so afraid, a love I have betrayed
Alone I cried and thought about the big mistake I've made
I wish I could explain, I'm the only one to blame

I've hurt enough of both of us and time will ease the pain
