When I get you all alone
I'm gonna move in nice and close
Aint nobody gonna interrupt my game
Oh, no, no

Ever since youve been hanging around
Ive been trying to figure out
What I can say to you to get some play, yeah

Can we do, what we did last night again
Baby, you and Id be better friends
Dont you think its time we went a bit further?
Oh yeah, yeah

Every night when we say goodbye
I can't help looking in your eyes
Wondering why you and I havent hit it
Can we get it on?

Im kinda faded but I feel alright
Thinking about making my move tonight
I cant pretend that youre only my friend
When youre holdin' my body tight

Cause I like the way youre making your move
I like the way youre making me wait
At the end of the night when I make up your mind
Youll be coming on home with me, yeah, yeah, yeah
