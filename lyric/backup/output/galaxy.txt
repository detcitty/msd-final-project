Take me to your place in space
I'm simply tired of mad rage
On rocket ship no time to wait
I just want to gravitate

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

I'll take you out to see the place
Where the man and the moon have a simlin' face
