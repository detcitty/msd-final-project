2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, winter just wasn't my season

Yeah we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

And 'cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl
So cradle your head in your hands

And breathe, just breathe
