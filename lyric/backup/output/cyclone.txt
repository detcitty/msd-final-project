She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
Just like a cyclone

She moves her body like a cyclone
And she makes me wanna do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone
A mighty cyclone

Now look at that pepper on the back of that bumper
She ain't even playing when she's shaking that rumper
And oh, you ain't know she get lower than a muffler
Even with her girlfriends show stopping with a hustler

The way she move her body she might see the Maserati
She wanna put it on me tryna show me her tsunami
She make it hard to copy always tight and never sloppy
And got her entourage and her own paparazzi

Now there she go again riding through the stormy weather
