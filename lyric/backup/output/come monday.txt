Headed up to San Francisco
For the Labor Day weekend show
I got my Hush Puppies on
I guess I never was meant for glitter rock & roll
And honey, I didn't know that I'd be missin' you so

Come Monday, it'll be alright
Come Monday, I'll be holding you tight
I spent four lonely days in a brown L.A. haze
And I just want you back by my side
