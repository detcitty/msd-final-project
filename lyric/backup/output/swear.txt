I wont bother asking what youve done
Though the rumors all point to something going on
See the past is the past, Im not gonna dwell
But I better never catch you with someone else

So Ill put it to you once, but never again (swear)
If you wanna be a lover, if you wanna be a friend (swear)
Then take five fingers, and put it to your heart (swear)

S.W.E.A.R.
