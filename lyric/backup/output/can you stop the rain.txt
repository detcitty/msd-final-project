Here's another morning without you
Here's another day; will I get through it
Without breaking down?
Haven't seen the sun since you've been gone
Like my heart, I lost it when you left me
And it can't be found

How can I go on?
Baby, I'd be living on memories
Of you and me
All the love we made
All those tender nights
And those endless days
They're all here inside

(Chorus 1:)
Baby, can you stop the rain from falling?
Won't you chase my clouds away?
I'd give anything to see the sun again
