I sit by the telephone
Waiting for you to call me
And when I'm alone in the night
The blues start to fall on me
Baby, I'm waiting for you
And all that's on my mind
Is what I'm gonna do

My friends say I'm crazy
And I'm wasting my time on you
I'm breaking the rules
And I'm way out of line it's true
Baby, one night with you
And they'd be goin' crazy too
