Hello [x7]
Hello, is there anybody up here?
(Hello) Welcome 2085!
Twenty Eighty-five it is (just me up here I guess)
(OHH! [x2])The magic of the moon done snuck up on me
And caught me by surprise (OHHH! [x3])
Roamin and I'm lonely man I'm longin
For that somethin in your eyes (OHHH! [x3])

And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink
(And I know it's not the drink)
But whatever it might be (Whatever it might be)
Just keep holdin on to me
(OOH!) Cause I'll pull down a cloud for you
I'll circle the stars and bring you one back
I'll walk through the sun for you
Cause there's somethin you do
That got me walkin on the moon
(Uhh)There's something you do
That got me walkin on the moon
(Uhh)And I know that it's true baby
You got me walkin on the moon
