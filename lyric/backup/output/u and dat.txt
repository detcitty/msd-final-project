Tryna to get to you and that monkey
Tryna to get to you and that monkey
Tryna to get to you and that monkey

Girl, he simpin'
(Simpin')
I walk up in the club with a limp and
(Limp and)
God listen, what you gonna do with this pimpin'?
What you gonna do with this pimpin'?

Girl, I'm a call ya
(Call ya)
Later on tonight or tomorrow

What you gonna do with this baller?

What you gonna do when I bend the block?
(Bend the block)
Pull up on that ass in a brand new drop?

TV's in the dash, rims just won't stop
You need to be down with a pimp like me
I ain't turning down nothing but my collar, you see
