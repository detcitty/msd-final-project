[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
The wound heals but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love
You're at war with love, yeah
[Hook: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
This battle
[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruin's wooing me
Arrow holes, they never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up
And you know that you should know
And let her go
But the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover strong
Sends you back into the zone
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter
On the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle
Maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone
