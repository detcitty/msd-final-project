To the one on the flamboyant temper, just toss that ham
In the fryin' pan

Like spam
Feel done when I come in slam
Damn
I feel like the son of sam
Don't make me wreck shit hectic
Next to the chair got me goin' like General Electric
EEEN!
The lights are blinking
I'm thinking
It's all over when I go out drinking
Oh, makin' my mind slow
That's why I don't fuck wit da big four-o
Bro', I got ta maintain
'Cause a nigga like me is goin' insane
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane

Got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Do my shit undercover
Now it's time for the blubba

Blabba
To watch that belly get fatter
