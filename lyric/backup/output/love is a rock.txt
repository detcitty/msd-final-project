My love is a rock, an immovable force
Anywhere that you are my love is right here
With any tick of the clock life can change it? s course
But my love will not, my love is a rock

Headed out into uncharted waters
What you feel is your only guide
And each step that you take brings you closer
Just trust what you feel inside

'Cause something? s telling you to keep on going
Telling you that your aim is true
Could be the voice of reason or just blind devotion
Whatever it is it? s calling out to you, singin'

My love is a rock, an immovable force
Anywhere that you are my love is right here
With any tick of the clock life can change it? s course
But my love will not, my love is a rock
