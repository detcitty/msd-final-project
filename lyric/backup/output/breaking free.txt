We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach

If we're trying
So breaking free

You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are

Creating space between us
'Till we're separate hearts

But your faith it gives me strength
Strength to believe

We're breakin' free

We're soarin'

Flyin'

There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach

If we're trying

Yeah we're breaking free

Oh, we're breakin' free
