Cotton wool fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, 4 wheel drive
and a tail light circle
Roll down the windows turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup

Get the party, started
Girl you make my speakers go BOOM boe
Dancin' on the tailgate in the half moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm mmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue
jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
