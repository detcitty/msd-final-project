Yeah ladies i know your tired of the same old thang-thang
Things have become so mundane
I mean your bedroom is just so cold, so cold but I’m here to tell you
I got a strategy we bout to heat it up (I like that)

(Chorus)
Girl get comfortable we bout to do something you neva done before
Baby not the usual tonight we gettin unpredictable
So tryyy to roll wit me baby... baby
I’m a make you feel like you neva felt,
Girl all because you let me get unpredictable

(Verse 1)
Baby 1 plus 1 ain't 2 when you wit me
C ain't after A and B when you wit me
It don't make sense right now but it will
Later on when you see how I make you feeeel
REGULAR ain't in my vocabulary
When it comes to love makin neither is missionary
Positions, girl pick one better yet some
Never mind that we tryin all of em Soooo
