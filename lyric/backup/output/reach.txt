Sometimes
I stop and wonder
Why can't I let myself enjoy
The space I'm in
And all the wonderful places I've been
My arms around the future
And I can think about the past
My aspirations always exceed
My grasp
You got to reach
A little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey
Whoa whoa
You've got to grow
Sometimes
Know that you've got to reach
A little bit higher (little bit higher)
