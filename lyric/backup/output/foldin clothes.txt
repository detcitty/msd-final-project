I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby I wanna do the right thing
Feels so much better than the wrong thing
I wanna fold clothes for you

I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I, walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
Iâ€”I see a lot on your plate
9 months with that weight
I know you tired so, I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer, oh
I wanna fold clothes for you

I wanna fold clothes for you
