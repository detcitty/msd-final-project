(Cheech:)
Took a walk to the corner store
Just to buy a loaf of bread and a box of s'mores
Up pulled a guy in a yellow van
Shiny gold badge flashing in his hand

(Chong:)
He said, alright all you mojados down here
I want you all to hit the floor
I got one thing to ask you and nothing more
So answer in English, if you can
Where were ya born, man

(Cheech:)
Huh? Where was I born?

(Chong:)
That's right, I said
Where were ya born?

(Cheech:)
Hey, are you one of those dudes who do horoscopes, man
Hey, I'm a Cancer with a bad moon rising
