I think that it's time that I should just let you go
So I'll tell it to your face instead of tell it to you on the phone
You see, I thought that you were special, baby, something unique, but lately I've come to find
That you're not really interested in my heart or mind

That's all right, that's okay
You never loved me anyway
And I think it's time for you to just move on
That's all right (that's all right), that's okay (that's okay)
I bet you never thought you'd hear me say
That I think it's time for you to find another dumb blonde
'Cause it's not me, no, no
