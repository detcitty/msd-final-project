Don't you open up that window
Don't you let out that antidote
Poppin' pills is all we know
In the hills is all we know (Hollywood!)
Don't go through the front door (Through the back!)
It's lowkey at the night show
So don't you open up that window
Don't you let out that antidote
Party on a Sunday (That was fun!)
Do it all again on Monday (One more time!)
Spent a check on a weekend (Oh my God!)
I might do it all again (That's boss shit)
I just hit a three peat
Fucked three hoes I met this week (Robert Horry!)
I don't do no old hoes (Oh, no, no!)
My nigga, that's a no-no (Straight up!)
She just want the coco (Cocaina!)
I just want dinero
Who that at the front door?
If it's the feds, oh-no-no-no (Don't let 'em in, shhh)
