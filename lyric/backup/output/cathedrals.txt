Where have the numbers gone
That marched across my bed
The faces after faces
Still inside my head

No words of love
The hollow sound
Of hungry people in the night
(Hungry people in the night)
Do not say it was wrong or right
(Not say it was wrong or right)

But call it flight (fly away)
Oh, can Heaven tell me
Where they are now
They could fill cathedrals

Where are they now
They're in the dance halls
They're in the diners
They're in the streets

Where are they now
