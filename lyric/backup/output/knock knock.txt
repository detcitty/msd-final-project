Its funny how the tables turn turn turn turn

Its funny how the tables turn now its you running after me
Didn't wanna spent quality time, didn't think I would ever leave
You got way to comfortable, now you say you want me in your life

Knock Knock Knock
Stop knocking don't come knocking at my door
Ring Ring Ring
