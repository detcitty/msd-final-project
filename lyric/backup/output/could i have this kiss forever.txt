Over and over I look in your eyes
You are all I desire
You have captured me
I want to hold you I want to be close to you
I never want to let go
I wish that this night would never end
I need to know
Could I hold you for a lifetime?
Could I look into your eyes?

Could I have this night to share this night together?
Could I hold you close beside me?
Could I hold you for all time?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever?
Could I, could I, could I have this kiss forever, forever?
Over and over I've dreamed of this night
