Picture you, picture me, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll
Paper doll, paper doll, paper doll, paper doll

Imagine yourself as a link on a chain
The chain is wrapped around someone's mind
If you break off, then things start to change
And then you realize that there's no time

No direction as you fly through the wind
You stop to ponder on a pink Chateaus
The theme from "Mahogany" still transcends
Quote Unquote, that's the way it goes

I'm looking at the picture again
I'm looking at the picture again
I spin the sun dial to expectation
Twenty years ago, I saw you yesterday
