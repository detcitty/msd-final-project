Know we need it, soul power
We got to have it, soul power
Know we want it, soul power
Got to have it, soul power
Give it to me, soul power
We need it, soul power, we need it, soul power
We got to have it, soul power

I want to get under your skin
If i get there, i've got to win
You need some soul, come on get some
And then you'll know, where i'm comin' from
I may lay in the cut and go along
And i'm still on the case and my rap is strong
Huh huh, hey
Go jump on my train, when i'm outta sight
Just check yourself, huh, and say, yeah you're right
Huh, hit me, give me, put it there, huh
Love me tender, and love me slow
If that don't get it, jump back for more
We gotta gotta gotta, get in the bracket
You know i like it, hey

Huh, look here, you gotta get in the bracket
You know i like it, all right, look in here, all right
Don't fall on the ground, you've got to get down
Down down down down...

Huh, huh, good god
I've got to ask you what we need, soul power
