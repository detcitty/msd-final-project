Five bad boys with the power to rock you
Blowing your mind so you gotta get into
Five, whatcha waiting
Four, if you wanna
Three, three
Two, two
One let's do it

(Welcome to tonight's game
and if you've just tuned in these five guys
have been taking it to the rim
slam dunking the whole night
I'm feeling really great, how about you John?
Hit me)

Do you wanna get freaky
When the five of us make one
You gotta push the good vibe on
If you really wanna feel it
