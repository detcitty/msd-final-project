It's too bad not to know
I don't know, I hurt you so
Baby talk to me

I'm so sad, I can't wait
Baby, please don't hesitate
Baby talk to me

You never try to talk your feelings through
Communications start from me to you
We have to talk it through to clear the air
We've got to talk to show the love we share

Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk
I know without a doubt

Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk

Baby, please talk to me
Can't you see you're hurtin' me
Baby talk to me

We can see all this through
Talk will help love [Incomprehensible]
Baby talk to me

It's hard to tell when things start goin' wrong
