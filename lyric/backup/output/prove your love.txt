Prove your love, got to prove your love
Ooh yeah

I hear all about what you can do
But I've got to know, is it true?
You're telling me to trust, what should I believe?
You promised so much but talk is cheap

You told me that you're serious
But I got to know for sure
You say how much you want me
But I've heard it all before

Prove your love, got to prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
