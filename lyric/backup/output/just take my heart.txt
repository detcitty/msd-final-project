It's late at night and neither one of us is sleeping
I can't imagine living my life after you're gone.
'Wondering why so many questions have no answers
I keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong

Where is our yesterday
You and I could use it right now
But if this is goodbye

Just take my heart when you go
