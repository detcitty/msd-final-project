Girl, when I look at you,
You look through me like I'm not even there.
I'm trying not to give up,
to be strong but I'm afraid to say I'm scared.
I can't find the place your heart is hiding
and I'm no quitter but I'm tired of fighting.

Baby I love you
Don't want to lose you,
Don't make me let you go.
