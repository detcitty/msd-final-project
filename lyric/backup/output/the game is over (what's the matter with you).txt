What's the matter with you
You don't smile anymore
What's the matter with you
You've forgotten my name for sure

You held me in your arms
You thrilled me with all your charms
Now that you got what you wanted
You say

[CHORUS]
The game is over (game is over)
Game is over, game's over
How could I win when I
Never even knew I played
