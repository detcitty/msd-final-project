(I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
I'm gonna walk away from love
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away
Gonna walk away, gonna walk away)

It's not that I don't love you
You know how much I do, huh
And it's not that I've found someone
To take the place of you
It's just to feel the feel with in me
Every time you touch my hand
And a dread that shakes my body
That even I don't understand
