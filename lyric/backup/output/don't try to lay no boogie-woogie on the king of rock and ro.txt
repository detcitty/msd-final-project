(SPOKEN)
You know, I remember
A few years ago
Some funny things
Used to happen to me
About 1956-57

At that time there was
No blues scene or not really
Any kind of scene in London

I used to go out and play
My guitar in the streets
And sing things with
Passing my hat down

I remember one particular night
I was playing the guitar
In a little alleyway just off
Of Wardour Street in Soho
And I got busted by the police

This policeman come up and
Dragged me and my guitar
And my hat full of pennies
Off to the police station

Anyway, the next day
I had to appear in
Marlboro Street Police Court
And it was quite a day
Police officer
Giving his evidence

I was proceeding in a
Southernly direction, milord
When I heard strange sounds coming
From Wardour Place, milord

A sort of boogie woogie
