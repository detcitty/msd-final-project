Whether you like it or not, he's back
D-A-double D-Y Fat Sacks
Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game dun' changed Out-
Kast came to heat it up

Sharp as a tack like I just left church (clean)
Smart than a tack when the windows won't work (mean)
Ridin' in the Cadillac Beatin' like some beat it up
The game dun' changed Out-
Kast came to heat it up

And everybody wanna know whus really goin' on
Is you and 3000 still makin' songs?
So on and so on
I can o-on and o-on
and on, and on, and on
Hell yes!

Music make the world go round
Where it goes (where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (ya just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band
Im a fan in the stands
Yes I am and Im hollerin' hey baby
Sayin hey baby

So baby please dont leave me
Dont you go (dont you go)
