It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic
One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be (it's a kind of magic)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day (it's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time (it's a kind of magic)
