The rain is falling lightly on the buildings and the cars
I've said goodbye to city friends, department stores and bars
The lights of town are at my back, my heart is full of stars
And I'm gonna be a country girl again

Oh yes, I'm gonna be a country girl again
With an old brown dog and a big front porch and rabbits in the pen
