Baby, the clock on the wall is lying,
It's not really that late.
It's too cold outside to be walking around the streets of this town,
And wherever you think you have to be can wait.


(Chorus)
Why don't you stay with me?
Share all your secrets tonight.
We can make believe the morning sun never will rise.
Come and lay your head on this big brass bed.
