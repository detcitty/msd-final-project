Imma rap to you real quick.
I wanna enjoy the luxury of like
not knowing each other for real. Hol' up

Lotus flower bomb, firefly
When I'm low, she take me high
I can teach you all the sounds of love

Flower bomb, let me guess your favorite fragrance
And you got that bomb, huh, I'm tryna detonate you
No disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile
Try to keep my spirits up, that's why I lays it down
Try to keep your spirits up, lil' vodka whatever
Took you forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort
So I clap for her, she deserves an applause
Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton
Shawty where your baton, racing through my mind like
She heard that I got that work, I heard that she been on strike
