Lil' Jay on the track, nigga
Aye and you already know it's ya boy Lil' Scrappy
We finna have the whole M-F world, rockin' in dis bitch
Look at shawty, check her out
Southern smokin'

I like the way she rock her hips
Then wave and sip
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips, then wave and sip

Look at them hips; I like how she rock it
She bend that thing ova and to the ground
She can drop it
And pop it hard as she can; got me hard in da pants
Because she in all her stance
Doing her muthafuckin' dance, man
Look, lil' body, cute in da face
She rock her hips to the bass, then she take a sip
When she wave
And wanna get wit' Lil' Jay
