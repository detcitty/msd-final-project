Sit tight, I'm gonna need you to keep time
Come on, just snap-snap-snap your fingers for me
Good, good, now we're making some progress
Come on, just tap-tap-tap your toes to the beat
And I believe this may call for a proper introduction

And well, don't you see-ee-ee, I'm the narrator and this is just the prologue...
I swear to shake it up if you swear to listen
Oh we're still so young, desperate for attention
I aim to be, your eyes
Trophy boys, trophy wives
I swear to shake it up if you swear to listen
