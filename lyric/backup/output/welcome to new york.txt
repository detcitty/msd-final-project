Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
