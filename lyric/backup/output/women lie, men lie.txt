Women Lie, Men Lie
Women Lie, Men Lie
Women Lie, Men Lie
The numbers don't lie

Ay, step up in the party and them bad b-tches be on me
I be sippin on Patrone, when I'm jumpin out ferraris
I be rocking Gucci sometimes Louie, I'm retarded
3 oh 5 chevy, and the shades by Bacaray
Hatin on my scrap I got my mind on my money
Milan on, taking nothing from me

Hated on these, hated on these.

Ballin is my hobby, damn homie going shoppin
Got 5 star with me a milli in the lobby
