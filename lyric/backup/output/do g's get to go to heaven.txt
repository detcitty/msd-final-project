Dedicate this to my man Tupac
Rest in peace, boy, you know it's all luv
Do we get to go? Do we go?
I want to know right now, I need to know

Who holds jurisdiction over my twisted thoughts?
And I'm not to blame for what happens off in this game
I'm do or die about my scratch but I know
This dope game for me just ain't tha way to go

But still I'm there grin and Waten
For that next paper thinkin' about how to loaded another caper
It's some cold shit to know, I can slang all night and slang all day
But never have tha courage to pray

Believe I know better but somehow I feel that I'm lost at the crossroads
But I'm afraid to cross, could it be what I'm drinkin'? It got me thinkin'
Like I'm thinkin', "Lord I need help but I can't help my self"
I awake to to sirens, homies dien, kids in tha street with no food to eat
Hoes gettin' money in they only profession
But Lord I only got one question?

Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die
But if so I'd like to know
Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die

Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die
But if so I'd like to know
Do G's get to go to Heaven?
'Coz I don't wanna die

And if I took a life are perhaps sold some dope
Would you discriminate upon my entry to tha gate?
I need to know my fate, 'coz now my life ain't straight
But look at this place where I live its so so crooked
