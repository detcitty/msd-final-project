Yeah, it's 50 A.K.A. Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it
You said you a gansta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin
of mine
What makes you think that I'm a run up
on you with tha nine
We do this all tha time, right now we on
tha grind
So hurry up and cop and go selling nicks
and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like dat gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with
every nine
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em
press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around
the rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cuz I commit
the crime
I send you my line, I did it three to nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who
droppin' dimes
You said you a gangsta
But you neva pop nuttin'
You said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
