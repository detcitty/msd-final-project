Miss November Tuesday
Bend your rubber rules
Take your time but don't take
Off your high heeled shoes

She's in demand at dinner time
She's on the factory wall
And when the gentlemen retire
Guess who's in control?

She blew your money
On taking a cruise
If that isn't funny
Well, watch out teacher

Ooh, ooh, when the chamber's empty
