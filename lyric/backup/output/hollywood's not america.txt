Born Helena Jane
With a restless soul
She moved west to california
Became a center-fold

But once you change your name
Well the pieces fall
Now she hardly recognizes herself at all

And there's never any rain, when you want it
A hollow little game, and you've won it
Looking for a thrill but you've done it all
