Have I told you
Lately that I love you
If I didn't, darlin'
You see, I'm so sorry
Didn't I reach out
And hold you
In these lovin' arms
Well, if I didn't, oh baby
Well, I'm so sorry

When I realized that you need love too
Gonna spend my life makin' love to you
Got to be a lover
Have mercy
Forgot to be a lover, babe
Forgot to be a lover
Forgot to be a lover
Make it on through to you somehow
Got to be a lover, babe
Forgot to be a lover

Well, did I ask you
Yes, would you come and share
Oh, share
Oh, the burden and the task
That's at love's command
Didn't I say
