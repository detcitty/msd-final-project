How could the one I gave my heart to
break my heart so bad?
How could the one who made me happy
make me feel so sad?
Won't somebody tell me
so I can understand?
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that?
How could the one I gave my world to
throw my world away?
How could the one who said "I love you"
say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to
just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to
break this heart of mine?
Tell me...

How could you be so cold to me
