When you see a deer, you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake, you think picnics
And I see a largemouth up under that log

You're probably thinking you're gonna change me
In some ways well, maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up
Ah but no matter what
Remember I'm still a guy

When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
