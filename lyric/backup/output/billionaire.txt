I wanna be a billionaire so frickin bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights yeahh
A different city every night oh
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire
Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
Give away a few like here lady have this
