The signs are getting clearer, clearer than you need
The writing's on the wall, for you to see
You never thought you'd ever get the taste
You never thought that it could be this good
Just tell me what you want and I'll find the key
Reach out and touch it's all yours.

If you hang in long enough, you'll do it
Just hang in long enough
