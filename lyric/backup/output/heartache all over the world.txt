Well I'm running away
From this house on the hill
There's a devil inside
Sitting on the window sill

And it's a wild Friday night
And I'm all on my own
I knocked on every door in town
There ain't one little girl that's home

And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend
Honey, when your heart's on fire

And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
