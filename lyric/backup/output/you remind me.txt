Oooh you remind me, yeah
you remind me of such sweet memories

(Chorus)
I saw you before baby
It's a deja~vu honey
don't you know that you remind me

I saw you before baby
It's a deja~vu honey
Don't you know that you remind me

(Vs.1)
You, you remind me of a love that I once knew
Is it a dream or is it deja~vu
I just had to let you know so I had to sing it
