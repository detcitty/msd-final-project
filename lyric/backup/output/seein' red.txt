Flame
Girl you light it up when I hear you say my name
Yeah you know just how to start it
You shine, and I can't wait to get you out tonight
Yeah you know how bad I want it
Ride this Chevy like a Cadilac
Well that one stop light, no lookin' back
Wherever we're going gonna get there fast

I'm talkin' red-hot red kiss fallin' off your lips
I'm talking red-hot red dress hangin' on your hips
I'm talkin' backseat heatbeat poundin' in my chest
I'm seein' red
I'm seein' red
