Just a girl born in Dixie
washed in the blood
and raised on the banks
of the Mississippi mud
She always had a thing
about fallin' in love with a bad boy

Yea, they could see it all comin'
but her daddy never dreamed
she'd grow up that fast
you know what I mean
The way a girl gets
when she turns 17
Kinda crazy

She's a rebel child
and a preacher's daughter
