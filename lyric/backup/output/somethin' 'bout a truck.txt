There's somethin' 'bout a truck, in a farmers field
A "No Trespass" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so whats the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmers field
There's somethin' 'bout a beer sittin' on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that drop tailgate, on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout a beer, sittin' on ice
Yea there's somethin' 'bout a girl, in a red sundress
