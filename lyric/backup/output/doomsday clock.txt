Is everyone afraid?
Is everyone ashamed?
They're running towards their holes
To find out

Apocalyptic thieves
Are lost amongst our dead
A message to our friends
To get out

There's wagers on this fear
Ooh, ooh so clear
Depends on what you'll pay
To hear

They're bound to kill us all
In white-washed halls
The jackals lick their paws

Please don't stop
It's lonely at the top
These lonely days
Will they ever stop?
