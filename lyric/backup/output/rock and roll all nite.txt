You show us everything you've got
You keep on dancin' and the room gets hot
And you drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
And you say you wanna go for a spin
The party's just begun, we'll let you in
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy

You keep on shoutin', you keep on shoutin'

I wanna rock 'n roll all nite
and party every day
