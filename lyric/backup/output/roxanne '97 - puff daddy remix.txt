Yeah ye ye yeah yeah
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Sting, Bad Boy remix come on
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Hey yo shake what ya mama gave you is her motto
Pour out the bottle, blow out the candle
Too broke to hold, too shallow to handle
Get all today you never promised tomorrow

Yeah, her moves remind me of Kung Fu flicks
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Thick lips that contradicts
Rules of the game, she plays the politics
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Red light special, red light district

Put on ya make up body all made up
Platinum played up, Pearl Jam cut up
Roxanne, Roxanne you don't really have to
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
Put on ya red dress if you feeling kind of blue

She got the hots for the disco jocks
Rock ya socks at the pop of the tops
Never get cool like to call it Glock
Twisted minded like Bob Zealot

Roxanne
(Roxanne, Roxanne)
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
(Roxanne, Roxanne)

Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
