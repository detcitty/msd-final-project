Engine, engine number 9
Get me, get me back on time
Move on, move on down the track
Keep that steam cominÂ´ out the stack
Huh! keep on movinÂ´
Keep on movinÂ´, keep on movinÂ´
Ooow! Uh!
Engine, engine number nine
Keep on movinÂ´ down the line
Seems like I been gone for days
I canÂ´t wait to see my babyÂ´s face
Look-a-here, been so long
Since I held her
Been so long since I held her
Ooow!
