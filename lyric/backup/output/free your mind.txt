Prejudice, wrote a song about it?
Like to hear? Here it goes

Free your mind

I wear tight clothing, high heel shoes
It doesn't mean that I'm a prostitute (no, no, no)
I like rap music, wear hip hop clothes
That doesn't mean that I'm out sellin' dope (no, no, no)

Oh my, forgive me for having straight hair
It doesn't mean there's another blood in my heirs
I might date another race or color
It doesn't mean I don't like my strong black brothers

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why, oh why must it be this way?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Before you can read me you got to learn how to see me
