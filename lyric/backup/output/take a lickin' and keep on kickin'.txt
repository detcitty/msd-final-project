It´s your life
Yeah, it´s time to start livin´ in the land of more
Ready, set, go
It´s your life
More, more, more
Oh, don´t you know?
This is your life
Ever-lovin´ life, yeah
Don´t you know that this is your life
Don´t you know it´s your life?
Get ready, set, go
The music is the key to life
I don´t be what you see
Groovin´ naturally
