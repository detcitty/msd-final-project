Oh, she may be weary
Young girls they do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness

You know she's waiting
Just anticipating
For things that she'll never, never, never, never possess
But while she's there waiting, without them
Try a little tenderness (that's all you gotta do, this is for you)

It's not just sentimental, no, no, no
She has her grief and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
It makes it easier, easier to bear

You won't regret it, no, no
Young girls they never forget it
