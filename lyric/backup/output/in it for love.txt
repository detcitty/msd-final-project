Some men only want power
Let them have it
We all have our reasons for wanting to survive
Just give them a chance and they'll grab at it
God only knows how much is enough to keep them satisfied

Now I don't need more money
Cause I don't see the world the way they do
And I don't care what they're in it for
Or what they're dreaming of
I'm in it for you
