J-Lo, ya tú sabes, no es más nada

It's a new generation
Mr. Worldwide
Of party people
Get on the floor, dale
Get on the floor, RedOne

Let me introduce you to my party people in the club, huh

I'm loose, loose
And everybody knows I get off the train
Baby, it's the truth, it's the truth
I'm like inception, I play with your brain
So I don't sleep or snooze, snooze

I don't play no games
So don-don-don't get it confused, no
'Cause you will lose, yeah
Now, now pu-pu-pum-pu-pu-pu-pump it up
And back it up like a Tonka truck, dale

If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak, then step on the floor
If you're an animal, then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor
