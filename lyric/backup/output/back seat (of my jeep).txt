Ah yeah
I wanna send this one out to all the jeep lovers worldwide
City to city, ghetto to ghetto
Some flavor for you and yours
And your jeep

You're the type of girl that got class and style
Still in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while
So I pull up to your door to give you what you're looking for
Unh, hardcore
I know you wanna come... in my jeep
We can park on a back street
You're checkin' out my carphone, scopin' out my jewelry
Let's do this in a hurry
Air freshener is kickin', drive through for chicken
I know you need a good stickin'
That's when I see my man snoop
Peace, what up kid? loungin' duke
As I turn the corner, starin' in your cornier
You're gettin' hornier and hornier
I'm pumpin' up a blint tape (flavor)
You're legs is incredible, I do a double take
You're puttin' on your lipstick
I wanna give you this big fat...(yeeeaaa)
Quick, I know a place where we can lounge and cool, don't sleep
(where at? ) back seat of my jeep
