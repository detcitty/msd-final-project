I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody finding theirself
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up I'm feeling the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I been hurt I seen the scar tissue
If I show you would you run away
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay
Do I, even need you, should I leave you
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my, heart, quit tearing mine apart

I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
