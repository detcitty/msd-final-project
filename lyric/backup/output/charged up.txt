I'm so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it cause all y'all charity cases

All y'all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitching on us without no interrogation
I stay silent â€˜cause we at war and I'm very patient
Six God is watching, I just hope you're prepared to face him
I'm charged up, I'm charged up

Wow, I'm honored that you think this is staged
I'm flattered man, in fact, I'm amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are getting into your feelings on me
