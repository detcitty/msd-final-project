This is the room
Where I sat and waited till the morning
Watching the door
You slammed so hard it broke the windows

Up and down I've climbed these walls
It seems I'm trapped inside this

House full of reasons, I should be moving on
You had me believing this is the way love goes
Off and on among normal people
