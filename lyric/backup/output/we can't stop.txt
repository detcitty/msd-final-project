oooohh oooh
yeah

Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
Cause we came to have so much fun now
Got somebody here, might get some now
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "hell no"?
Cause we gonna go all night
Till we see the sunlight, alright

So "la da di da di", we like to party
Dancing with Miley
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it we who bout' that life?
