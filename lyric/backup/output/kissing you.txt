Thinking of you
That's all I seem to do
When you're not here
I long to hold you near

Baby, this time
Together we must bare
Holdin' you close
Takin' time to let you know

Tonight's the night we will share
Turn off the lights, come close to me
Tell me I'm all you ever need
Tell me it's not just a dream
And if it is my heart believes
That you are mine and this is real, oh... oh...

(Kissing you)
Lovin' you all through the night
