I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock, girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock

She got that good, good, she Michael Jackson Bad
I'm attracted to her for her attractive ass

And now we murderers because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth like a soccer team

Cold as a winter day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves, steal your love and leave

I like the way you walk and if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place with all kind of space
I let you be the judge and I'm the case

I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't even wonder 'cause she know she bad
And I got her nigga, grocery bag

Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue
Baby, wanna spend it all on you
