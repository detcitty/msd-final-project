Just a castaway, an island lost at sea, oh
Another lonely day, with no one here but me, oh
More loneliness than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair, oh

I'll send an S.O.S to the world
I'll send an S.O.S to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle, yeah

Message in a bottle, yeah

A year has passed since I wrote my note
I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together

Love can mend your life
Or love can break your heart
