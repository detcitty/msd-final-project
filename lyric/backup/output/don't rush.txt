Don't rush, baby, don't rush
(Hey, hey, hey, Ooh)
Don't rush, baby, don't rush
(Hey, hey, hey, Ooh)
Don't rush, baby, don't rush
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah)
Don't rush, baby, don't rush

I know it's after midnight, baby
You said you've gotta be to work at eight
I'm feelin' kinda kinky right now, baby
I'm tellin' you, you might have to be late

(Woh, don't rush me)
Don't rush, baby don't rush
(Ooh no)
Don't rush, baby don't rush
