Buried treasure
All that hidden loot
She didn't seem so dangerous
Harmless, yeah to boot
You break the ice
She'll turn on you
She's way beyond the law
She yells, "Freeze!"
When you want her to thaw

She's a dead aim, sure shot
Sweet ammo in her shoe
What fits right at her chest
She's got aiming right at you
She'll make a sharp inspection
Of more than head to toe
