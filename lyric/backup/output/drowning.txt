Don't pretend you're sorry
I know you're not
You know you've got the power
To make me weak inside

And girl, you leave me breathless
But it's okay
'Cause you are my survival
Now hear me say

I can't imagine
Life without your love
And even forever
Don't seem like long enough

Cause every time I breathe, I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

Every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby, I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love

Maybe I'm a drifter
Maybe not
