Well, I won two dollars on a scratch-off ticket
So I went back to the counter and I bought two more with it
And I won ten bucks and that was just right
So I bought a six-pack and a bag of ice

Ya know even if our ship came in
and this is all we got
It ain't like we really need a million dollar yacht...'
cause

We got an inner tube
