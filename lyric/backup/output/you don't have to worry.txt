chorus:
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I ain't satisfied
You don't have to worry
I won't waste your time
I ain't satisfied

Love is made,
Made of many things
And one of them is trust
But I can't trust you anymore
Things you say (say) how about the things you do?
They won't hurt me, no
They won't hurt me anymore
