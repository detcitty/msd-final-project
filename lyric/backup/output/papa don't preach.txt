Papa I know you're going to be upset
I was always your little girl
You should know by now
I'm not a baby

You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help daddy please be strong
I may be young at heart but I know what I'm saying

The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess and I don't mean maybe
Please

Papa don't preach
I'm in trouble deep
Papa don't preach
I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind
