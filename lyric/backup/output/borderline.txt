Something in the way you love me wont' let me be
i don't want to be your prisoner, so baby, won't you set me free
stop playing with my heart
finish what you start
when you make my love come down
if you want me, let me know
baby, let it show
honey, don't you fool around

just try to understand, i've given all i can
