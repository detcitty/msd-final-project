After the party it's the Waffle House
If you ever been here you know what I'm talkin about
Where people don't dance all they do is this
And after the original you know what it is

Welcome to Atlanta

Remix it had to go down
I got somethin else to tell you 'bout the new Motown
Where people don't visit, they move out here
And ain't no tellin who you might see up in Lennox Square
I don't know about you but I miss the freaknik
Cause that's where my city use to be real slick
People from other cities use to drive from miles
Just to come to get a taste of this A.T.L style
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballin-ist Player
Make my own moves, call me the mayor
Monday night you know things change with time
Magic sittin back lookin like eighty nine
All the homies on the southside up in the Ritz
Tuesday night, the Velvet Room same shit
Wednesday Strokers I don't go no mo'
Cause they don't know how to treat you when you come through the do'
Thursday night, was Plush but we moved the fuel
And I be up in the booth drunk actin a fool
Friday night, at Kaya they still got love
And the Sharkbar we poppin like it's a night club
Saturday still off the heezy fo' sheezy
You can find me up in One Tweezy
Sunday gettin me some sleep please!!!
I'm on my way to the deck then hittin Jazzy Tee's, holla!!!

Ay yo I'm from New York man!!!
Representin N.Y.C. to the fullest
I pull it, Heads be duckin in New York be bussin
Take that...
