I will dedicate and sacrifice my everything
For just a seconds worth of how my story's ending
And I wish I could know if the directions that I take
And all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing

Show me what it's for
Make me understand it
Cause I've been crawling in the dark
Looking for the answer
Is there something more
Than what I've been handed?
