yeahh.
Girl I've been searchin so long thru this world
trying to find someone who could be
what my picture of love was to me
and you came along
When I saw you I knew you were the one
the love that I've been dreamin of

I've been waitin for you (waitin for you)
all my life for somebody who (somebody who)
makes me feel the way I feel when I'm with you, baby

have you been waitin too
