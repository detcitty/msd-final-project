Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
You found a reason for leavin'
Soon as I gave my love to you

And oh, ah, whoa, the pain you put me through
You don't care â€˜bout my love for you, huh
But I found a reason for livin'
And I'm through with cryin' over you

And now I feel a song in my heart again
I knew as soon as I felt him lookin' through me
I feel a song in my heart again
High on the wings of the things he's doin' to me
