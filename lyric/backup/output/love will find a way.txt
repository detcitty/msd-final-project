Someone, someone's done me wrong
You thought that
Your love was strong
Now you're feeling like
Such such a fool, poor you

You're thinking
Maybe if you said goodbye
You'll understand the reason why
The love you had felt so cool

Oh, but it's all right (all right)
Once you get past the pain
(Past the pain)
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way

Sometimes we all
