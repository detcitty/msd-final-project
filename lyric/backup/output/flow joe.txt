Ahhhhhhh yeah!
Da Fat Gangsta

Chorus: repeat 2X

You gotta flow Joe, you gotta flow Joe
You gotta gotta gotta gotta let em know Joe

[Fat Joe]
Bust it, check it, watch how I wreck it
Niggaz watch your back, shit is gettin hectic
I catch vibes like Count Basie, sucker won't face me
I'm so much flavor you can taste me
I'm underground like a gutter
You never catch me - stutter, everybody knows that I'm butter
I'm not the man with sensitivity
The name is Fat Joe, the label's Relativity, huh
I chop a rapper like a meat cleaver
I'm burnin hot, people think I have a fever, check it
If niggaz wanna front, then come widdit
If you're havin second thoughts, well then forget it, see
I dig in my crates, I don't per-pa-trates
I got shit sewn, like Billy Bathgate
Beware like Cocoa, yo I'm not a slow boat
Got so much dough I va-cate in Acapulco
Crazy as they come I'm not the one, we can do this
with the hands, or take it to the guns.
