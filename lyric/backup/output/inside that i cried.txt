The talks we had on stormy nights
I often rushed away
When you were not in common sight
I was held by your embrace
I gaze and see the pain you feel
To think we had to part
I didn't feel you loved me
So I played games with your heart

CHORUS:
It was inside that I cried
It was inside that I cried
No long drawn out speeches
