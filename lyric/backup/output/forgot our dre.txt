Y'all know me still the same ol' G
But I been low key, hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's, mad at me

'Cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies

But y'all think I'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho please, you better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies

Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's
And a group that said, â€½Motherfuck the policeâ€
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good

Who's the doc that he told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or the Firm flop

Y'all are the reason Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all all of y'all, if y'all don't like me blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin' around with me
And turn me back to the old me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they
Got something to say but nothin' comes out
When they move they lips, just a buncha gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they
Got something to say but nothin' comes out
When they move they lips, just a buncha gibberish
