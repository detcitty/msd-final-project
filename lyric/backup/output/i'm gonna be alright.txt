Oh yes (Uh, this for you girl)
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from "Casino" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cars in yo hand
All I know is Nas was yo man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'
Funny cause for awhile
Walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me "This ain't right"
Don't you know, it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Cause I love you I just got to say
I used to say I didn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
