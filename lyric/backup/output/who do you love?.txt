Buzzard on da beat hoe.
I'm that nigga with the plugs
I'm the nigga who got homies that be sellin' drugs
I'm the nigga on the back street
With the fat heat, niggas better run like athletes
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
My Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block
Police pull up, I'm tryna stash the Glock
You that nigga on the low-low
You're the nigga, you're the one that be talkin' to the po-pos
Porsche sittin' on Forgi's
Niggas can't afford these
The Panamera shittin' on the 9-11
I call my homies, not 911
I'm the nigga with the juice

But I'll never do my nigga like Pac did Q
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?

Bitch, who do you love?

Bitch, who do you love?
I got a shorty name Texas Syn
She got a buddy named Dolce B and now you know the deal
We turnt up in the studio late night
