Feel it comin' in the air
And the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair

Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight

Is who's gonna run this town tonight
We gonna run this town

We are, ya I said it, we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything

And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I'd get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper

I'm a couple hands down, and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave the other grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma, six zeros, dot zeros, here it go
Back to runnin' circles 'round, now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
