Funny how time flies
Funny how time flies when you're making love
Funny how time flies when you're making love
Funny how time flies when you're making love

Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on, and on we just can't go wrong
Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on, and on we just can't go wrong

Saturday night, I feel alright heading to your place
Kiss your lips, fingertips slide down past my waist
Feel the heat, rising me just inside your door
Throw me down, back to the ground under and explore, yeah

You keep my mind on baby you know what to do
The way you slide down on me I get so into you
Girl your love is what I need and I don't want to be missin'
