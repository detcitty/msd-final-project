You say it's gonna rain and no one's going to go out tonight
You say it's gonna rain that's why I hope you hold me tight

If I only live my life for you
There's only one thing I'd like to do
So I'm hoping you give me this chance
So tonight let us start our romance

You say it's gonna rain and no one's going to go out tonight
You know it's gonna rain that's why I hope you hold me tight
