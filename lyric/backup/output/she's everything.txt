She's a yellow pair of running shoes
A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything

She's 'I want a piece of chocolate'
'Take me to a movie'
She's 'I can't find a thing to wear'
Now and then she's moody

She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing

She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
