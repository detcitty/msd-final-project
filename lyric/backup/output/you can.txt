If you wanna love me
Baby, then just love me
You can, you can, you can
If you wanna make it
Baby, simply take it
You can, you can, you can
Darling, how you can

Don't keep love a secret
Teach me how to reach it
You can, you can, you can
Don't you keep me yearning
Show me all your learning
You can, you can, you can
Darling, how you can

Share the night together
Make it last forever
