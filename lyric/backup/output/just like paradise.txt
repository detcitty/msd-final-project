Rockin' steady in her daddy's car
She got the stereo with the big guitars
And that's all right
Yeah (All right)

I got the itch and a restless soul
She gone with the wind, gonna go for broke tonight, yeah
And that's (All night)

Girl, we've been meant for this since we were born (Since we were born)
No problems now, coast is clear (Ooh)
