Oh

I wanna be bad witchu, baby
I, I, I, I
I wanna be bad witchu, baby

Do you
Understand what I need, need
From you
Just let me be the girl to show
You, you
Everything that you can be
Is everything that I can be
(I wanna be) My turn
Let me let you know that I,
I can't promise that I won't do that
So, boy
Say the time and place
'cause you make me wanna misbehave

.: Chorus:.
I wanna be bad (bad)
You make bad look so good
I've got things on my mind
