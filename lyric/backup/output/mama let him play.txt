Mama let that boy, play some rock n' roll
jazz is much to crazy
he can play it when he's old
he's too young for the blues
he's still inside his first pair of shoes
(he's just a baby)
Give that boy some freedom
let him move around
don't get in his way
you'll only bring him down
Mama won't you let him
let him play some rock n' roll yeah
let him play some rock n' roll
let him play some rock n' roll
let him play some rock n' roll
