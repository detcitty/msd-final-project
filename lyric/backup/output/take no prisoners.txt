There's an all out war tonight
Here's our chance to win the fight
Or lose your life

Listen for the battle cry
Lay your heart upon the line
Tonight, it's time
Defend your crime

Oh, oh, you better get ready
Oh, oh, cause my aim is steady

(CHORUS)
I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing or it's not enough, oh
I take no prisoners in the game of love

It's a one on one attack
