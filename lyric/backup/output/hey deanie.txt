Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The stars are dancin'
Like diamonds in the moonlight
And we could never find a better time
To be in love

Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The summer's waitin'
The moon is shinin' so bright
Hey Deanie you're the one
I'm dreamin' of

I was a fool for your love
From the moment I saw you
Like a vision in the darkness
Of a thousand lonesome, lonely nights
Like my heart threw away the key
I'm as blind as a man could be
Oh darlin'
Till you help me see the light

Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The stars are dancin'
