(Q-Tip)
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubine
Niggaz, take off your coats ladies, act liike gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the mo-mo
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J Beez on the promo
On my never endin quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm takin it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers to invade the way
Hold up a second son, cuz we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't perp the roll
See my shit is universal, if you got knowledge and dolo
Of delf for self, see there's no one else
