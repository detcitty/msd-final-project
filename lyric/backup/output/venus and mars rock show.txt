Sitting In The Stand Of The Sports Arena
Waiting For The Show To Begin
Red Lights, Green Lights, Strawberry Wine,
A Good Friend Of Mine, Follows The Stars,
Venus And Mars
Are Alright Tonight.


What's That Man Holding In His Hand?
He Looks A Lot Like A Guy I Knew Way Back When
Its Silly Willy With Philly Band
Could Be . . . . . Oo-Ee . . . . . .

What's That Man Movin' Cross The Stage?
It Looks A Lot Like The One Used By Jimmy Page
Its Like A Relic From A Different Age
Could Be . . . . . Oo-Ee . . . . . .
