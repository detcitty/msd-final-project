Rick Astley & Rob Fisher

She comes home in the morning light
Tries to hide the secret of last night
Tells a tale of working late
Says the things she knows I hate

Why should I convince myself
That she loves me and no one else
Feels like time to break the chains
I wont be fooled again

Gonna take my time
Gonna take what's mine
I'm gonna move right out
Gonna take my time
Gonna keep my pride
