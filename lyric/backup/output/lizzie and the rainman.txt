He came ridin' in on the sunrise of a hot west Texas day
A fancy man in a painted wagon with some fancy things to say
Looks like you folks need some water, well water is my game
And for the small price of $100 I betcha I can make it rain

Step back non believers or the rain will never come. Someone start that fire a-burning somebody beat the drum
