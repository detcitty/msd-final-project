Oh, oh, oh, oh
All the shawtys in the club
(Let me see you just)
Back it up, drop it down
(Let me see you just)
Get low n scrub the grown
(Let me see you just)
Push it up, push it up
(Let me see you just)

Wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble (yeah) Get in there, yeah, yeah Ey big girl make em' back it up, make em' back it up I got em' shakin their boobies like congos,
Man I'm shaking the city like quakes.
The haters blue the face like gonzo,
Cause I'm rakin a cake so let's bake.
I'm taking the game, the games mine.
Ya'll witness a change it's my time.
