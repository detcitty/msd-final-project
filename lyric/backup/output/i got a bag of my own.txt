I got a bag of my own

Now, baby
Stop all that gabbing
We don't need
No backstabbing

Come take
Take care of all of mine
My good stuff

You know I'm grown
I've got a bag of my own

On my good book
I don't back up
Take my tea
From my favorite cup

My groove is still
Out of sight
Got the hook
Protect my love, right

Three times seven
You know I'm grown
