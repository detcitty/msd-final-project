(Yeah!) Weed and syrup 'til I die
(Okay, new Playaz Circle)
As a matter of fact, it's gon' kill me, BITCH!
Cause you ain't! (Tell 'em, shawty!)
So get high (Tell 'em, Weezy!) or get low

If I don't do nothing I'mma ball
I'm countin all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy - get money
I ain't ever ran from a nigga
And I damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin
Look honey - I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin
Get money

The beat so hot, the flow is so ice cold
Walk into the Gucci store, honey I'm home
I am on my shit I need a Pamper on
