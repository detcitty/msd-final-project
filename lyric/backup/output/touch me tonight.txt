Oo-oo-oo Oo oo Oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo Oo

I'm on fire with somebody
Well I just can't believe it's you again
All those lies and they're hurting
It's taking time for all those scars to mend

Girl, since you left me
It's been a long time... a long time
We'll lay it on the line

If you'll just touch me tonight
And give me one more chance to make it right
Baby touch me tonight
If you feel the love in your heart
Then touch me tonight
