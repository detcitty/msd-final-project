She knows I want her
she knows I need her

she knows she got my love.
But I'm apprehensive
she's so expensive
girl

just can't get enough.
I'm the one who does 9 to 5
hustlin' for my bread

While she's decidin' what dress to buy

layin' around in my bed.

Goin' to the bank
she got me goin' to the bank.
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
she got me
got me.

Drives my Mercedes
lunch with the ladies

she loves the finer things.
