Verse One: (Markie Dee)

One minute you're so fly and now you're busted
Sweetheart, we got a lot to discus kid
Your relationship is wavering
Don't walk away, come here and listen
Cause I speak straight up so they attract
I'm sorry baby but your man ain't all that
Before you verbally stomp me, just wait a sec
And explain why you're always looking wrecked
By now any other lady would have just had it
Looking depressed at battered, shattered
Dreams of you two being the perfect item
The feelings you had try to fight them
Cause your man's a conniver so stay alert
Mark my words you're gonna get hurt
Does your man abuse you physically or mentally?
Change what I put, slavery you need to be free

Chorus:
