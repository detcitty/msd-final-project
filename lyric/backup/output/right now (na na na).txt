It's been so long (long, long)
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryna be strong (strong)
But the strength I have is washing away (way)
It won't be long (long)
Before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind

I wanna make up right now (na na)
I wanna make up right now (na na)
iWish we never broke up right now (na na)
We need to link up right now (na na)
I wanna make up right now (na na)
I wanna make up right now (na na)
Wish we never broke up right now (na na)

We need to link up right now (na na)

Girl, I know (know, know)
Mistakes were made between us two
