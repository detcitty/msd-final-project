Hello, helluva, hey, how you doing
It's me, the mac of BHC purusing you
Who in the world gave you the right
To look so, well, um, uhh, dynomite

Sucking on her finger with a
Now or Later in the middle
How I feel for you, girl
Is no riddle (I want her)

Yeah, I got to have her
She looks mo better so I
Want her mo badder than
A big man in quicksand hopes for help
At a glance, I'm a go for self

She's as cute as a puss in boots
With good hair and it's real to the roots
Damn near perfect, all my life
I've prayed for an all world girl
Who's sweet as Kool-Aid

And thoughts of doing that
It can make me cry
You're a helluva babe
Oh, me, oh, my

Helluva, helluva (she's so fine)
Helluva, helluva (blows my mind)
Helluva, helluva (lights my need)
Helluva, helluva

She's a helluva girl, yeah
The one I want in my life
She's a helluva girl, yeah
The one I want in my life
