(Jay Z)
You can't roll a blunt to this one
You gotta, you gotta well, ya gotta light a J
You gotta puff a J on this one. (inhales)
You can't even drink Crist-OWL on this one
You gotta drink Crist-ALL. Woo!
Buy some red wine, a little Gocha 9-7
This is for the grown and sexy
Uhh!

(Pharrell - over penultimate line to intro)
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Ex-cuse me; what's your name?

(Jay Z)
Yeah, can I get my groove in on someone
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be hangin wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z

(Pharrell)
So hot to trot... la-dy!

(Jay Z + Pharrell)
Excuse me miss, what's your name?
Can you come , hang with me? 
Possibly. Can I take you out, to-night

You already know what it's hittin for
Ma I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin on
50/50 Venture with them S dots kickin off
Armadale poppin now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid. All I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, All trust!
Who else you gon' run with, the truth is us
Only dudes movin units - em, Pimp Juice and us
It's the Roc in here!
Maebach outside got rocks n air
PJ's on the runway, Young got air
I don't land at a airport, I call it the clearport
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!
