(Oh)
I wanna be your girl
(Yeah)
I wanna be your world
(Oh oh)
I wanna be your girl
(Yeah yeah)
I wanna be your world
(Oh)
I wanna be your girl
(Yeah)
I wanna be your world
(Oh oh)
I wanna be your girl
(Yeah yeah)
I wanna be your world

I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your world
Boy I think you should know
I wanna be your world
And if I was your girl
You would always be my world
Boy I won't let you go (nooo)

Boy from the first moment I saw you
I knew my heart would only be for you
Remembering the first time that you looked my way
That smile on your face just took me away
It's a dreamland boy you got to understand
I only wish one day that I could hold your hand
As we stroll through the park where the bluebirds sing
Or when you're walking me home after the school bell rings

It doesn't matter to me
Just as long as you're there
Whispering sweet nothings in my ear
