I'm so glad you're my girl
I'll do anything for you
call you every night
and give you flowers too

I thank the lord for you
and think about you all the time
and ask him every day

that you'll forever be mine

(I wanna hold your hand)
to show you I'll be there

(I like to do the things)
let you know I care

(I sing this lullaby)

'cause girl you fill me full
(I look into your eyes)
you're so beautiful

Oh girl I think I love you
I'm always thinking of you
I want you to know
I do it all for love
