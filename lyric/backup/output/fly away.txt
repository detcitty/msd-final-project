All of her days have gone soft and cloudy
All of her dreams have gone dry
All of her nights have gone sad and shady
She's getting ready to fly

Fly away
Fly away
(Fly away)

Life in the city can make you crazy
For sounds of the sand and the sea
(I'm of the sea)
Life in a high rise can make you hungry
For things that you can't even see
