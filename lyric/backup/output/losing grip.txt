Are you aware of what you make me feel, baby?
Right now I feel invisible to you
Like I'm not real
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you?
Why'd you turn away?
Here's what I have to say
I was left to cry there
Waitin' outside there
Grinnin' with a lost stare
That's when I decided

Why should I care?
'Cuz you weren't there
When I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm startin' to trip
I'm losin' my grip
And I'm in this thing
Alone
