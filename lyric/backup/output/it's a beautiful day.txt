I don't know why
You think that you could hold me
When you couldn't get by by yourself
And I don't know who
Would ever want to tear the seam of someone's dream
Baby, it's fine, you said that we should just be friends
While I came up with that line and I'm sure
That it's for the best
If you ever change your mind, don't hold your breath
â€˜Cause you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
