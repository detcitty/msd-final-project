War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers
(War)

People fill the world
With narrow confidence
Like a child at birth
A man with no defense
What's mine's my own
I won't give it to you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do

Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers
(War)

Man is far behind
In the search for something new
