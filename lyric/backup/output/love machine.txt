Oh, yeah

I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
(Yeah baby)
I'm just a love machine
A hugging kissing fiend

I think it's high time you knew
Whenever I think of you
My mind blows a fuse
(Baby)
When I look in your eyes
My meter starts to rise
And I become confused

My motor cranked electric goes
When I'm sitting next to you
Electricity starts to flow
And my indicator starts to glow

(I, I)
I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
(Oh, yeah)
I'm just a love machine
(Yeah baby)
A hugging kissing fiend

La, la la la la, la la la la, la la
