Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Yo, yo, yo uh)

Why you got an attitude?
(Uh-huh, yo)
Why you acting all foolish?
(Uh-huh, yo)
When you see me out in the street boy
(Ugh)
You wanna embarass me, call me names
Slap my face until
Until you see my friends come, ooh
Then you wanna try to console me, oh
(Uh-huh, yo, yo)
But they already know boy
(They already know boy)
