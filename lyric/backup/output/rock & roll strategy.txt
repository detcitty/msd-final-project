Men like me 'cause I speak my mind
And women like me 'cause I take my time
Try not to take life too serious
I might get burned
If you've got somethin' to show me
I'm willing to learn
Got enough trouble just making it day to day
And when the world starts spinnin'
'N I feel like I'm going insane

I got a system that's guaranteed
I got a rock 'n roll strategy
It ain't no science but it works for me
It's just a rock 'n roll strategy
Get in my car
Head downtown
