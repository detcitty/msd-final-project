Restless
Do do do

Sunday morning
Break of dawn and
I don't think I've slept at all
Ooh
I toss and turn and
Body's yearning
Thinking 'bout you all night long

Feel the thunder in my heart beating
It's tearing me apart
I won't rest until you're here beside me
Sharing my love through the night

I'm restless
I can't sleep a wink
Can't live without your love
