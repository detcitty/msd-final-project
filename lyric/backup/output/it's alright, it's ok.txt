Broken doll baby
And she says that life's a waste
It doesn't have to be that way
Dad threw away her mom

Her mom gave up his name
Crucified by their words
Nailed by shame
She stares into the sun

Self-inflicted pain
She sees that they're blind
Why does she take all the blame
The rhyme has changed compulsion rules

Mary's little lambs are now raised by wolves
A voyeur with wings flashes a cure
She knows forbidden things they have a lovely lure
