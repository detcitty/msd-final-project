So what's yo' status?. I be the baddest
.Bee to hit the scene since the gangsta lean
I'm all ears, so what you got to say?
I hope you bubblin it baby, now bubblin it my way
Let it rain; ain't no salt up in the game (nah)
Still want you the same (yeah) ain't a thing changed
Instead of knockin boots. we be kickin down Gortex
Except it ain't raw sex
