Something cool went down,
As I was walking with a friend of mine, and I,
I still remember,
How she was smelling like the summer time, and,

And ooh... how it changed my mind,
Changed everything, about that,
Come on girl,

It feels so good, loving you, yeah...
It's so good, the way you do the do...
It feels so good, and I need Oxygen,
Little bit of heaven doin' 24-7 again...
Yeah, again and again...
