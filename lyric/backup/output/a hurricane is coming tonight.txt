(Hurricane) I can feel it
(Hurricane) feel it coming
(Hurricane) yeah, it's coming now

[CHORUS]
A hurricane is coming tonight, baby
A hurricane is coming tonight
And the water and winds
Are gonna drown all your sins
A hurricane is coming
And I swear that it's true

? Is our house, baby
? Is our house
Gonna shake up and down
