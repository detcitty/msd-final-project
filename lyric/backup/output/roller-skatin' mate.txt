Ooh, hey, hey, ha
Ooh, ooh
Got my fingers crossed
I'm hoping I'll be skating with you
Got my fingers crossed
I'm hoping I'll be skating with you
Pardon me, but I gotta let you know
You're a fabulous skater
You're a one person show
You've got moves
Others dream they can do
I'd give anything on earth
If I could skate with you
Take my hand and we'll glide around the rink
To be grooving right beside you
Is all I wanna think
Fast and fine, hey, I can't look away
Got my eyes glued on you
And the way you swing and sway
I dig you every night, rocking to the music
You're like a sexy vision
Skating in the moonlight
Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date
Gee, I'd love to be your roller-skating mate
I can see us getting down on a roller-skating date
Got my fingers crossed, I'm hoping I'll be
Skating with you
Got my fingers crossed
I'm hoping I'll be skating with you
You're so free
You jump high up in the air
