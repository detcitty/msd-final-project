Last year's wishes
Are this year's apologies
Every last time I come home
I take my last chance
To burn a bridge or two
I only keep myself this sick in the head
Cause I know how the words get you

We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof and loneliness
At best, at best

Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
Me and you
Setting in our honeymoon
If I woke up next to you
If I woke up next to you
