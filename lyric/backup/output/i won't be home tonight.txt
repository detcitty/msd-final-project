I Won't Be Home Tonight

Do you think I'd come runnin at the drop of a hat?
oh baby don't you know me any better than that?
You're hot one minute, and gone the next
so tell me what do you expect?

you're standin' there tellin' me you're home for good
did you think I'd believe it? did you think I would?
you can turn it right around, where you come from
