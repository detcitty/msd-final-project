Aye, boy, don't spill my drink, boy, pull it
Now listen, everybody report to the bloodclot dance floor
You love the beat, boy, you know what it is
Yo, T.I.P., talk to them, bloodclot

I'm a real nigga, homie, show six figga's on me
I got a pistol, you don't want it but you know what it is
Aye, I'm way flyer, my pay is way higher
If they ever mention sire, boy, you know what it is

About that drama, you don't want no problems
I love that llama but you know what it is
Aye, I get money, all I count is big money
Because all she get from me, boy, you know what it is

Yo, T.I.P., let them little rock boys know how you livin'

The wait is over, here we go again, I'm back in the plate
Gon' sell another couple mill and take it back to the A
Gon' take that other couple mill and put it back in the safe
Find cash for the crew up only back in the lake

I'm up in cruises two steppin' with the gat in the waist
T.I. ain't in the streets no more, that what they say
Don't even try it when you sayin', boy, you have to be great
You can trust to hit ya in ya face your peeps will have to replace
