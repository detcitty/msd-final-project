Verse 1
Alone in a room
It's just me and you
I feel so lost
'Cause I don't know what to do
Now what if choose the wrong thing to do
I'm so afraid, afraid of disappointing you

Chorus
So I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my life is so cloudy
Guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart

Verse 2
My hopes and dreams
