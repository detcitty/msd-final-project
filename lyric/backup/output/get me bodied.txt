Mission 1: I'ma put this on
When he see me in the dress, I'ma get me some, hey
Mission 2: gotta make that call
Tell him, "get the bottles poppin' when they play my song", hey
Mission 3: got my three best friends
Like we do it all the time, we gon' do it again, hey
Mission 4: got the vintage Rolls
Drop a couple hundreds, tell him, "leave it at the door"

I ain't worried doing me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight getting bodied
Getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied, getting bodied
Want my body, won't you get me bodied?
If you want my body, won't you get me bodied? Hey

Can you get me bodied? I wanna be myself tonight
