I heard you had to drive him home after two umbrella drinks
I heard he's got a Prius 'cause he's into being green
My buddy said he saw y'all eating that sushi stuff
Baby that don't sound like you, that don't sound like love
Sounds like it sucks

He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
Ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
but not the kind in a Field and Stream book
