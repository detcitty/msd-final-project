I had a one night stand with my best friends baby sister
And to this day he still wont speak to me
I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in collage
For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline
I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had rung my neck
When she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack

If I had a dime
For half the things I did
