Verse 1:
He greets his father with his hands up
Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the mans child
The world is different since he seen it last
Outta jail been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother's letters
Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a changed and make it for the better
But he's black so he's got one strike against him
And he's young plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's callin' up his homie who done came up
Livin' lavish now they dealin' wit' the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth man
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
