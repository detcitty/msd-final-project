If you want my love, say it, say it, now, darling
Gotta let it out, say it, say it, yeah
If you want my love, say it, say it, don't worry
What it's all about, say it, say it, yeah

When I'm with you
You know just what the right things are to do
You actions move me but your attitude
It makes me so confused

You lead me on in the right direction
Then you let me down without protection
Ain't gonna be your sacrifice
Just a few words that might sound nice

There ain't no use in playing games
I'm wanting you, do you feel the same?
When in comes down to the bottom line
I really gotta know, am I wasting time?

If you want my love, say it, say it, now, darling
Gotta let it out, say it, say it, yeah
