Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Just tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want

Tell me what you want for me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is something you can have for years
Tell me what you want for me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is something you can have for years

Now Mase be the man wanna see you doing good
I don't wanna get rich, leave you in the hood
Girl, in my eyes you the baddest
The reason why I love you, you don't like me 'cause my status
I don't wanna see you with a carriage living average
I wanna do my thing so we be established

And I don't want you rock in them fabrics
Girl, I will give you karats till you feel you a rabbit
Anything in your path, you want you can have
Walk through the mall, if you like it you can grab
Total it all up and put it on my tab
And then tell your friends all the fun you had

Tell me what you want for me
Take a look at what you see
Let me know if this right here
Is something you can have for years
