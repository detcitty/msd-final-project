Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid

No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep

But still I had to keep on going

Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night

I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

If you believe in yourself enough

And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen

And if you get down on your knees at night

And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, ho yeah

I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong

Baby just hold on
