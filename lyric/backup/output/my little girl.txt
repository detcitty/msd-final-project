Got to hold on easy as I let you go,
gonna tell you how much I love,
though you think you already know,
I remeber I thought you looked like an angel,
wrapped in pink so soft and warm,
you had me wrapped around your finger,
since the day you were born.

You beautiful baby from the outside in,
Chase your dreams but always know the road
