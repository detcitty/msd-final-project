Gyal mi nuh steal like dem waan dey report you don't
Mi ready leave you weh you fire off the ground
Nuff a dem fake dem man a king a crown
Only thing keen bout dem self alone
Listen mi keen nuh baby tell a mi how mi sound
Ana weh dem likkle boy dey weh loose a brown
Mi alone ana make you start fi moan and groan
Cau mi an here lost strong like a stone

Boy you're my only (see the girl!)

I, I'm gonna flip these beats on ya

You don't even know me (aha!)

Said I am, I…
I ain't even gonna fight it
