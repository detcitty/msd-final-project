He'll sail on in with the summer wind
That blows on this came day
Everybody called him 'Pirate'
Dark and handsome in his own way

And the fire in eyes
Lit all the fire inside of me
And soon you were feeling
So much more than the wind and waves and sea

Pirate, I'm not gonna take your soul
I only want the right to love you
I know the sea won't let you go
Pirate, my love will only chain ya down
So just know how much I love you
And then turn that ship around
