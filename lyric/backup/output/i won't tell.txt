Baby, you could keep a secret
Calca, kills mania, hey, ey, ah, ah

Fresh off the runway, pair white Nikes
Phantom top drop on that I 95
Pink see us sucka'z who but I?
I'm on my way to party a crew NY

Now I ain't gotta tell you that them boys pop bottles
And mami's lookin' like America's top model
She said, "Ya earring, look at that thing
That's even bigger then the rock on my ring"

Now she got a man, plays for the Hawks
I'm like, "Come on ma, you know me run New York"
J'z in the background, put you to bed
Says he's got brains, so I'm lookin' a head

And I'm lookin' for bread, I gotta eat on these streets
Shit 17-5 'bout to holla at G'z
I'm a real nigga, real niggas do real things
And I can keep a secret, it's the song that I sing

Baby I won't tell, if you don't want me to
