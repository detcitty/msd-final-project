Gotta do it for the ladies
And I gotta keep it hood
Where we at Polo? Aye

Yo Keith nigga you was right
We just gettin' started, yeah man

You say you searchin' for a nigga
That'll take you out and do you right

And let daddy show you what it feel like

You know all you gotta do is
Tell me what you sippin' on
And I promise that I'm gonna keep it comin'
All night long

Lookin' in your eyes while you on the other side
And I think that shorty I've got a thing for you, yeah
Doin' it on purpose, windin' and workin' it

Make love in this club, yea, in this club, yea, in this club
