What I would do to take away this fear of being loved Allegiance to the pain
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing ya
Never be like you
I would give anything to change this fickle-minded heart
That loves fake shiny things
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing ya
He'll never be like you

I'm only human can't you see
I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
Cause I got it
He'll never be like you

I'm only human can't you see
I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face
Tell me everything's okay
Cause I got it
