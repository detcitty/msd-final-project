"Muthafucka Up"

YMCMB, rawest niggas doing it
School for the blind, I don't see these niggas doing it
I'm doing it and doing it and doing it well
Niggas wanna test me boy, who wanna fail?
Hit you like a bully bitch, yeah saved by the bell
If you scared, go to church I'll see you in hell
And your girl, she a flip, give me heads or tails
Everybody fake so I got real for sale
Gunpowder fill the air
Rappers shittin' on theyself, you could smell the fear
And these bitches laying flowers cause the king is near
T-Raw this is the new flavour in ya ear
Niggas softer than baby hair
Why you acting tough, heard you work at Build-a-bear
I'm a a dealer all my girls come in deuce and pairs
I'm in the building I construct so {ain't this muthafucker up}
What the funk you beezy's want
I'm ready to hump the car I call it ele-phunk
Trunk in the front
Man she give me good brain cause she feel dumb
