Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Rockin' everywhere, rockin' everywhere
I found you Ms. New Booty
Get it together and bring it back to me
Hit the playa's club for about a month or two
Put his hand on it then see what it do
I found you Ms. New Booty
Get it together and bring it back to me
Hit the playa's club for about a month or two
Put his hand on it then see what it do
Get it ripe, get it right, get it tight
Get it ripe, get it right, get it tight
Get it ripe, get it right, get it tight
Get it ripe, get it right, get it tight
Girl I don't need you, but chu need me
Take it off, let if flop, shake it freely
And I don't tell stories, I let â€~em tell theyself
And you ain't gotta sell sex, girl, it sells itself
Like nothing else, yeah I'm a country boy
But that big city bottom fill me up with joy
Ain't life grand? Live it up daddy
Here go da whisper song, baby this is us, ready?
Put it on me, enthusiastically
Whatever it is that chu do, you do it admirably
And I ain't choose it, that thang chose me
It's Bubba K. and Ying Yang, all the way in this thang
Yo!
