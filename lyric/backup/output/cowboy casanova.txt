You better take it from me,
that boy is like a disease.
You're running and trying, and trying to hide and you're wonderin' why you can't get free.
He's like a curse, he's like a drug.

You'll get addicted to his love.
You wanna get out, but he's holdin' you down,
'cause you can't live without one more touch.
He's a good time cowboy casanova,
