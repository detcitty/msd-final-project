A dirty old hole
In the side of the road
For the man who cleans the streets
Open pub doors
Where the working class goes at night

Written on walls
Where the cats never crawl
For the glass along the top
Man I was born there
I'm gonna walk right back

Costafine town, it's a fine town
I'm coming home
I feel so lonely, 
I've been too long away
