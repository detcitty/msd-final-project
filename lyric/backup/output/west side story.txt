(chorus)
Veronica's a song that's in my head
Veronica's a name I've often said
But her friends say she's too good for me
It's kinda like a west side story
She's the only one for me
She's the only girl I see
Can't seem to find a damn thing wrong with ya -
Veronica
Everyday, I see her friends talkin' 'bout me
But I know there's somethin' there tha no one can see
It reminds me of romeo and juliet
Like we're livin' on a movie set
Montague and capulet
Make your daddy sweat cause he wishes we had never met
She says that I just make her world go round
God knows I feel it too
I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I'm so in love with you
(chorus)
Veronica's a song that's in my head
Veronica's a name I've often said
