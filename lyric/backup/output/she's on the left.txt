Why must she come and possess me in the heat of the night
Toss me and turn me then disappear
Here on the edge of obsession, I turn off all the lights
And pray that this fantasy can be real

Night and day I want to kiss her lips
And caress her like a man should do
She's become the center of my emotions
And I can't fight through

She's on the left, she's on the right, she's in the middle of my mind
