My mama told me
She said, son, please beware
There's this thing called love
And it's everywhere

She told me, it can break your heart
And put you in misery
Since I met this little woman
I feel it's happened to me
And I'm telling you

It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love
It's too late to turn back now
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

I found myself phoning her
