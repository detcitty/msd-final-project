Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh

You're having a hard time and lately you don't feel so good
You're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood
It's alright, it's alright
Sometimes that's what it takes
You're only human, you're allowed to make your share of mistakes
(Only human, ooh, ooh)

You better believe there will be times in your life
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool (oh)
So take it from me you'll learn more from you accidents
Than anything you could ever learn at school

Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll get your second wind

Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
