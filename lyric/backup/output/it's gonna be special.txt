I've seen the many
Shades of love in my life
Until I met you
No one shined so bright

Some say that passion
Can't survive for very long
But I get this feeling you and I
Can make them wrong

(CHORUS)
Cause it's gonna be special
This love for you and me
Wait and see
It's gonna be special
It's written in the stars
And here we are

It's gonna be special
Gonna be special

I promise
