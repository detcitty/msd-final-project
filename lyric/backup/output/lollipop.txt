No homo, Young Moolah baby
I said he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper
So I let her lick the rapper

She, she, she licked me like a lollipop
She, she licked me like a lollipop
She, she, she licked me like a lollipop
She, she licked me like a lollipop

Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club

You know I love to touch ya lovely lady lumps
Shawty wanna thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch ya lovely lady lumps

Okay, lil mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair down her back like mine
I make her feel right when it's wrong like lyin'
Man, she ain't never had a love like mine
But man, I ain't never seen an ass like hers
That pussy in my mouth had me lost for words
So I told her back it up like, "burp, burp"
And made that ass jump like, "jerp, jerp"
And that's when she

She, she, she licked me like a lollipop (oh yeah I like that)
She, she licked me like a lollipop (oh yeah I like that)
She, she, she licked me like a lollipop (I like that)
