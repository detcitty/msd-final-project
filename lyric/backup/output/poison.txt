You're a cruel device
Your blood
Like ice
One look
Could kill
My pain
Your thrill

I wanna love you
But I better not touch
(Don't touch)
I wanna hold you
But my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you
But I want it too much
(Too much)
I wanna taste you
But your lips are venomous
Poison

You're poison
Running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

Your mouth
So hot
Your web
I'm caught
