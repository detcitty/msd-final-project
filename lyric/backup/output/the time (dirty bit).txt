This is international
Big mega radio smasher

I've had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you

Oh, I've had the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you
You, you, youâ€¦
Dirty bit

Dirty bit

I-I came up in here to rock
Light a fire, make it hot
I don't wanna take no pictures
I just wanna take some shots

So come on, let's go
Let's lose control
Let's do it all night
Till we can't do it no more

People rocking to the sound
Turn it up, and watch it pound
We gon' rock it to the top
Until the roof come burning down
