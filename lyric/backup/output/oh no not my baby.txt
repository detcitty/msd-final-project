When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I told them all, I had faith in you
I kept a-right on sayin'

Oh! No not my baby
Oh! No not my sweet baby

You're not like all those other girls
Who play with the men's hearts like they were toys
My mama told me, son, when rumors spread
That there is truth somewhere and you should use your head

But sure didn't listen to what she said
Don't you know I kept a-right on sayin'?

Oh! No not my baby
