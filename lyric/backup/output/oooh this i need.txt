Wow! I'm beautiful or so U tell me so
U say I've got the body that U just love 2 hold
It's so seldom people tell U what U wanna hear
It's so rare that your adventure overcomes your fear
Ooh

Wow! That feels good when U touch me there
(Ooh this I need, ooh this I need)
No one's done it quite like that, maybe no one really cared
(Ooh this I need, ooh this I need)
So baby, when I say I burn 4 U, this fire is truly your deed
