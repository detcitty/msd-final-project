Baby, they're at it again
I can't even go outside
To hang up clothes
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
Or go to the grocery store

Unless I see some of them
Out there pointing
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
Yeah, there she is, that's her
There's who

I ain't bothering nobody
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
I ain't done nothing
I wish they'd mind their own business
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)

Yeah, I know you know
But I wish they'd stop talking
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
Yeah, I guess life is funny that way

Yeah, I understand that
People are people and all
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
But I just wonder why people
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
