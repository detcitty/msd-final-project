Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh

You walk and talk like you're new sensation
You move in circles, you don't need an invitation
You spend you're money-you can't get no satisfaction
You play it right so you can get the right reaction
It won't be long, my darling
Pick up the phone-nobody's on it (on it)
Where are your friends now, baby
All of the ones supposed to be there for

You (You) (ah ah)
When you're falling down
The world starts spinning out
You (You) (ah ah)
When you're falling down
Now it's not all about
You (You) (ah ah)
When you're falling down
