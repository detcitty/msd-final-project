Eagle's calling
And he's calling your name
Tides are turning
Bringing winds of change
Why do I feel this way
The promise of a new day

The promise
The promise of a new day
As through time
The earth moves
Under my feet
One step closer
To make love complete
What has the final say
The promise of a new day

The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise
The promise of a new day
The promise

And so time over time
What will change the world
No one knows

So the only promise
Is a day to live, to give
And share with one another

See the wisdom from
Mistakes in our past
Hear the younger
Generation ask
Why do I feel this way
The promise of a new day
