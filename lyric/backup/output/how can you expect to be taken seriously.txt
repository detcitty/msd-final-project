You live upon a stage and everyone's agreed
you're the brightest hope by far that anyone can see
So when you take the limelight you can guarantee
you're gaining fame and claiming credibility
Tell me baby are you gonna get high as a kite?
Tell me baby are you gonna let it happen every night?
How can you expect to be taken seriously?
