Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside

Is there another in your memory
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
