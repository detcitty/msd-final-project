I know you wanna leave me, but I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg, plead for sympathy
I don't mind, 'cause it means that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, don't you go
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, don't you go

Well, I heard a quiet man is half a man, with no sense of pride
If I have to cry to keep ya, I don't mind weepin'
If weepin' gonna keep ya by my side

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
