He gets up before the dawn
Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin' rays are wearing down his body

And diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holding on

He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
