Well, I'll bet you any amount of money
He'll be coming back to you
I know there ain't no doubt about it
Sometimes life is funny
You think you're in your darkest hour
When the lights are coming on in the house of love

You've been up all night
Thinking it was over
He's been out of sight
At least for the moment

But when something is strong
Gets a hold on you
The odds are ninety-nine to one
It's got a hold on him too

Well, I'll bet you any amount of money
