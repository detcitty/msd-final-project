Let’s go
St. Louis
Yeah
Let’s go

I told ya I was gon’ change the game
LA all day
They can’t stop ya boy
They can’t stop ya boy
I get money
Ya muh's ain’t ready

Just walked through the door
What's it gonna be?
Take it to the floor
Boys all over me

Where my party, pa- party
Party, pa- party people at?
Where my party, pa- party
Party, pa- party people at?

Just walked through the door
What's it gonna be?
Take it to the floor
Girls all over me

Where my party, pa- party
Party, pa- party people at?
Where my party, pa- party
Party, pa- party people at?

It's Nelly
(Wait a minute)
Comin’ straight up out the Lou
And all you New Edition rappers better cool it now

'Fore I make a fool of y’all
Paper stacked as tall as Yao Ming
Look at the bling, settings in rings
Lookin’ like basketballs

Staring muh
Comin’ straight up out the Lou
And all you New Edition rappers better cool it now

'Fore I make a fool of y’all
Paper stacked as tall as Yao Ming
Look at the bling, settings in rings
Lookin’ like basketballs

Just walked through the door
What's it gonna be?
Take it to the floor
Boys all over me
