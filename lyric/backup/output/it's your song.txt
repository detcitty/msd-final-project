Standing in the spotlight
On such a perfect night
Knowing that you're out there listening
And I remember one time
When I was so afraid
Didn't think I had the courage
To stand up on this stage

Then you reached into my heart
And you found the melody
And if there ever was somebody
Who made me believe in me
