Let's do it, let's do it
Oh, let's do it, baby
Take your time, let's do it

Come on, baby
Oh, let's do it, baby
Take your time, let's do it

You know you ought to slow down
You been working too hard
And that's a fact
Sit back and relax a while
Take some time to laugh and smile

Lay your heavy load down
So we can stop and kick back
It seems we never take the time to do
