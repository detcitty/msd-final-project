All my people in the crowd
Grab a partner take it down

It's me against the music
Uh huh
It's just me
And me
Yeah
C'mon
Hoh!

Hey, Britney?
Are you ready?
Uh huh, are you?
Uh!

And no one cares, it's whippin' my hair, it's pullin' my waist
To hell with stares, the sweat is drippin' all over my face
And no one's there, I'm the only one dancin' up in this place
Tonight, I'm here, feel the beat of the drum, gotta keep with that bass

I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone, I wanna get in the zone

If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryin' to hit it, chick-ih-taa!
In a minute I'ma take a you on, I'ma take a you on
Hey, hey, hey
