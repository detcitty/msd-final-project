Nighttime slows
Raindrops splash rainbows
Perhaps someone you know
Could sparkle and shine
As daydreams slide
To colour from shadow
Picture the moonglow
That dazzles my eyes
And I love you

Just lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time

Dream of sights
Of sleigh rides in seasons
