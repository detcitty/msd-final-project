If I had my time again
I would do it all the same
And not change a single thing
Even when I was to blame

For the heartache and the pain
That I caused throughout my years
How I'd love to be your man
Through the laughter and the tears

Situation no win
Rush for a change of atmosphere
I can't go on so I give in
Gotta get myself right outta here

Now I'm fully grown
And I know where it's at
Somehow I stayed thin
