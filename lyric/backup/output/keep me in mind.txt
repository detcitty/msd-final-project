This is gonna be funky

How come all the pretty girls like you are taken baby
I've been looking for someone like you to save me
Life's to easy to be so damn complicated
Take your time and I'll be waitin'

Keep me in mind
Somewhere down the road you might get lonely
Keep me in mind
and I pray someday that you will love me only

I think about you somedays
