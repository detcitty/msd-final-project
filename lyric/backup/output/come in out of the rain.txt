Ooh ooh ooh

You said you believed that we'd find love together happily
After all the wrong I've done
You feel that I'm still the one to give your loving to
So bring it home to you

You told me that you'll love me if I'd ever change
Welcome me into your arms again
Come on in out of the rain, hey hey
