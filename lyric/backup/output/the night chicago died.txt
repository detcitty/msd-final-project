Daddy was a cop
On the east side of chicago
Back in the usa
Back in the bad old days

In the heat of a summer night
In the land of the dollar bill
When the town of chicago died
And they talk about it still

When a man named al capone
Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
Against the forces of the law

I heard my momma cry
I heard her pray the night chicago died
Brother, what a night it really was
Brother, what a fight it really was
Glory be
