All steady up in the club, just swagging doing my thang
Popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
Partying so hard, the ladies don't want it to end
They looked at me and said, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker, I heard that you're a heartbreaker
Baby I'm a troublemaker
See I'm that type of guy you won't love
I'm that type of guy you won't cuff

I'm that type of guy you daddy won't let go out
'Cause he thinks I sell drugs
I'm that type of guy that will save ya
I'm that type that will call you later

Won't be around to give you that time
Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper that I can do
Gotta keep my baby girl laced up in the latest and the fliest suits
Never want for nothing, let's get caked up

Hold it down, that's all you gotta do
Then I walk up in the place with a pocket full of money
My brother like I are the dude
Stepping out with the finest suits, look at me now
