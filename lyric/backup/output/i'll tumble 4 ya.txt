Downtown we'll drown
We're in our never splendor
Flowers
Showers
Who's got the new boy gender

I'll be your baby
I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you
And so much more

I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 you
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble 4 ya
I'll tumble...

Uptown their sound
Is like the native
You send her
Junction
