She don't laugh at everything but when she does the planet swings around her
She don't step on sidewalks seams, her teenage boyfriends all still dream about her
She don't need the glitter of the vegas lights, she blow a kiss and leave it spinning' like a tilt-a-whirl

I met a girl
She made me smile, she made me wait
She crossed the street, she crossed my heart
She fixed her dress, she bit her lip, she let me up
