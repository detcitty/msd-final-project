Out my window
The rain starts to fall
And the wind blows
Through an empty hall
In the mirror
Ooh, reflections of you

In the distance I hear a sound
Is that you coming around

(What you gonna do) Oh, what you gonna do
(I think I should) I think I should be with you
(A love that's overdue) A love that's overdue
