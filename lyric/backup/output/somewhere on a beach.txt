Bet you think I'm sittin' at home, naw

Bet you think that I'm all alone, naw
Bet you think I'm missin' you and wishin' you would call my phone

Hell, naw
I went wheels up on a runway
And that ticket was a one way
I'm somewhere on a beach
Sippin' somethin' strong
Got a new girl, she got it goin on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
she got a body and she's naughty
