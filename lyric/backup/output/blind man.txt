I took a course in Hallelujah
I went to night school for the blues
I took some stuff they said would cool ya
But nothing seemed to light my fuse
But that's all in the past
Like a check that's in the mail
She was a tall whiskey glass
I was an old hound dog
That just loved to chase his tail
Until I met a Blind Man
Who thought me how to see
