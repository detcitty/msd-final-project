Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was OK
Mama told us we are good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never traveled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing on this stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them

When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was OK
