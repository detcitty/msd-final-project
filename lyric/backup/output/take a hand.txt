Turn up your radio and put your ear to the sweet, sweet music
And take your baby and hold her in your arms and hear the music go
And if you're feeling like it, go get your lover and reel and rock her
And roll it over and hold her tighter, hold her tighter, do what she needs

You've got to take a hand, take a hand
