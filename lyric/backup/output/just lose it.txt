Down, down, down!

Okay,
Guess who's back?
Back again.
Shady's back,
tell a friend

Now everyone report to the dance floor

Alright stop,
pajama time.
Come here little kiddies, on my lap.
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusates
Ah ah ah ah ah,
No worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor,
I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide

Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung hole

And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot poot, it's okay
(Poot)
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

Now I'm gonna make you dance,
it's your chance

Yeah boy, shake that ass,
whoops I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl you know you're my world,
