When I lose my smile
When my thoughts get jumbled
When the air and BS get too thick
Can't take a breath without getting sick
I've had enough with this concrete jungle
I drop my truck and drive
I pick up my baby
She jumped on scene with a kiss and a hey
We exited off that old highway
Sometimes you gotta go beyond the pavement

You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you're gettin' close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road and you go
