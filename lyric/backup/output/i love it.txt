I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge
I watched, I let it burn
I threw your stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs

I crashed my car into the bridge
I don't care
I love it

I don't care

I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge

I watched, I let it burn
I threw your stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs

I crashed my car into the bridge

I don't care
