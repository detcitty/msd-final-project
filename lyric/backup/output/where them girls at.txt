So many girls in here, where do I begin?
I seen this one, I'm 'bout to go in
Then she said, "I'm here with my friends"
She got me thinking, and that's when I said

Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends

Hey, bring it on, baby, all your friends
You're the shit, and I love that body, body
You wanna ball, let's mix it, I swear you're good
I won't tell nobody-body
You got a B.F.F., I wanna see that girl
It's all women invited

Hairdos and nails, that Louis, Chanel
All up in the body
Presidents in my wallet, no rules, I'm 'bout it
Blow the whistle for the hotties
I got it, shawty, it's never too much
Can't be doing too much

Ten to one of me, I can handle that love
