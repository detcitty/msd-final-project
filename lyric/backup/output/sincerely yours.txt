Dear I write you this letter
To show you how much your love means to me
I wish we could be together
I need you in my life oh can't you see

You promised we would be together
But you still haven't answered my letter

Oh, oh, I'm sincerely yours
The one my heart beats for, the one I adore
Oh, oh, I'm sincerely yours
The love that you gave I've never felt before

Dear as I write you this letter
