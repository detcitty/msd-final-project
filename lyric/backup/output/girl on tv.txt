I'm wishing on a falling star...
Wondering where you are...
I wished for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind
In the warm sunshine
She's from the city of angels
Like bette davis, james dean and gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on tv
Met her at a gala affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt outta place as she looked into my eyes
Sher hand around 9 pm and now
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never have to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams
Shoobie-do-wop and scooby snacks
Met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
