You can't hide the pain
I can see it scrawled on your empty face
And I feel the hurt
It's in the words you say, they make me want to

Scream out to the world
For taking life for granted and I know
You are by my side
When I turn to hear you cry

I am so afraid of living in oblivion
I am so afraid of living in oblivion
