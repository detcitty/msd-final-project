Revvin' up my engine
I'm like a 747, baby
Shiny, lanky, long and lean
And I'm mean
Revvin' up my engine, baby
Like a 747, mama
Shiny, lanky, long and lean
What a scene

I'm gonna take my silver dollar
Change it into quarters
Shove 'em in the record machine

Baby said she loved me
But then she went and left me
Causin' such an awful scene
What a scene
Baby said she needed me, you know
