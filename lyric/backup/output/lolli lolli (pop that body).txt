Please lord, have some mercy
This girl is throwin' judi
I think she 'bout to hurt me
See she went front then back
She went side to side
I'm throwin' blank checks
I think I need a ride
One pocket full of pills
A little bag of that cola
The other one full of weed
And a semi auto pistol-a
I ain't no dancin' dude
But I can lean like a cholo
See mami go wit me 'cuz I cant be goin' home solo

Lolli lolli lolli lolli let me see you pop that body
