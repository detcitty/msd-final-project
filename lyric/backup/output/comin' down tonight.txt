Girl don't you run and hide
It's not you're runnin' from
You've built your walls so high
Can't see which side you're on

Just give your heart some rope
Let love take over, let me show ya
We're gettin' nowhere baby
It's time to just let go

I'll be knockin' down your wall
It's comin' down tonight
I ain't turnin' back no more, no
Stay with me baby
There's nothin' girl
We can't work out in time
