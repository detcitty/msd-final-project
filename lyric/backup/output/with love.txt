I don´t mind you telling me what´s been on your mind lately
I don´t mind you speaking up (speaking up)
I know sometimes I can be all wrapped up and into me
I can be in such a rush (such a rush)

Just slow me down (down)
Slow me down (down)
Tell me tomorrow everything will be around
Just slow me down (down)

Slow me down (down)
You´re the one who keeps me on the ground
Baby can you be tough
Say enough is enough
You can even be blunt
Just do it with love love love love
Tell me I´m wrong
That I´m comin´ on way too strong
