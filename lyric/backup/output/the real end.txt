Once I had a sweet love
Always followed me around
The way I treated my little lamb was like
The Marquis D. Sade and Her new clown

I guess I hurt him
I guess I hung up
I guess I should have called him back
I guess I didn't care
Maybe I left him there
Maybe a woman just acts like that

What's a matter?
Hey baby, baby
What's a matter?
Don't you want me?
What's a matter?
Now Baby, baby
What's a matter?
