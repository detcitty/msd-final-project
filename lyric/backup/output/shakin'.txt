Rosanna's daddy had a car she loved to drive
Stole the keys one night and took me for a ride
Turned up the music just as loud as it could go
Blew out the speakers in her daddy's radio

She was shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)
Snappin' her fingers (oh oh ooo oh)
She was movin' round and round (oh oh ooo oh)
That girl was shakin' (oh oh ooo oh)

We started drinkin' wasn't thinkin' too straight
She was doin' 80 and she slammed on the brakes
