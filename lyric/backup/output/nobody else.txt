Now as I look around
What do I see
Everybody wants to try to get to know me baby
now it's my porogitive to do what I want to do
and I couldn't see myself babe with no one but you

I don't want nobody else but you
cause no one makes me feel
the way that you do
I don't want nobody else but you
cause no one makes me feel
the way that you do

Now I see you just cant handle
