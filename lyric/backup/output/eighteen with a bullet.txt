(Do, do, do, do, do, do-do-do-do)
(Do, (doop, doop) do, do, do, do)
(Do, do, do, do, do, do-do-do-do)

(Do-do-do-do...)

I'm eighteen with a bullet
Got my finger on the trigger, I'm gonna pull it
I'm picked to click now
I'm a son-of-a-gun

So hold it right there little girl, little girl
We're gonna have big fun

I may be an oldie, but I'm a goodie, too
I'll last forever and I'll be good to you
Oh, yes I will
