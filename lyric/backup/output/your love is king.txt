Your love is king
Crown you in my heart
Your love is king
Never need to part
Your kisses ring
Round and round and round my head
Touching the very part of me
It's making my soul sing
Tearing the very heart of me
I'm crying out for more

Your love is king
Crown you in my heart
Your love is king
You're the ruler of my heart
Your kisses ring all around
Round and round and round my head
