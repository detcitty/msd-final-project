Newage Girl
Deadeye Dick

I've got a new age girl
(Tell us what she's like)
Environmentalist girl
(Does she ride a bike?)

She has a crystal necklace
(She spend a lot of cash)
Though her vibes are rather reckless
(Heading for a crash)

Oh, her flowing skirt is blowing in a transcendental wind
And she wonders without knowing, where did we begin

Mary Moon, she's a vegetarian
(Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon)
