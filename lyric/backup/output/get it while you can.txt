In this world, if you read the papers, darling,
You know everybody's fighting on with each other.
You got no one you can count on, dear,
Not even your own brother.
So if someone comes along,
He's gonna give you some love and affection
I'd say get it while you can, yeah!
Honey, get it while you can yeah,
