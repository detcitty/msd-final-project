Don't know much about your life
Don't know much about your world but
Don't want to be alone tonight
On this planet they call earth

You don't know about my past and
I don't have the future figured out
And maybe this is going too fast
And maybe it's not meant to last,

But what do you say to taking chances
What do you say to jumping off the edge
