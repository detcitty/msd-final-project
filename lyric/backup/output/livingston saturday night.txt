You got your Tony Lama's on your jeans pressed tight
You take a few tokes make you feel alright
Rockin' and a rollin' on a Livingston Saturday Night

Got the pickup washed and you just got paid
With any luck at all you might even get laid
'Cause they're pickin' and a kickin' on a Livingston Saturday night
