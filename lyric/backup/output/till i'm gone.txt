I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)

I buy time in Switzerland
I drive round in Monaco
I shook hands with Royalty
I make songs that monarchs know
Ti Ti Ti La So fa?
Mi Mi Mi Ra Do?
Call me Aloe Blacc cause I Need That Dollar yo
Ha ha
Hic-hic-hiccup
Blame it on the liquor
I came through like a stick up
Now I'm ballin' like a kick up
I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of Nip Tuck
And yes I am the best man, I'm so sorry bout the mix up

Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Let's do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill
You know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough
