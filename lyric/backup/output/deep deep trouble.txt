Homer: Bart!
Marge: Go to your room.
Bart: Yeah, right.

Well, you're damned if you do,
(What are we talking about?)
Well, you're damned if you do,
(Where's your sense of humour?)
Well, you're damned if you do,
And you're damned if you don't.

Homer: Bart!

Bart: Let me start at the start, then take it away.
My name is Simpson, Bartholemew J.
That's Bart, with an art, and a capital B,
Then Simp, plus S-O-N, that's me!

Introductions aside, let's move right along,
You can all sing along at the sound of the gong.
(Sound of the gong)
Once upon a time, about a week ago,
All of a sudden, trouble started to grow.
Alarm was buzzin', I was snoozin',
S'posed to get up now, but I was refusin'
To let reality become an intrusion,
'Cause in dreamy-dream land, I was cruisin'.
But the buzz kept buzzin', my head kept buzzin'.
Gave the radio a throw, and heard an explosion.
(Homer: D'oh!)
Opened up my eyes, and to my surprise,
There stood Homer, and his temperature risin'.
I was chillin', he was yellin',
Face all distorted, 'cause he was propellin'.
It wasn't what he said, but more of his tone,
The usual jive, put your nose to the grindstone.
I said "I'm real sorry" but that didn't cut it,
I started to protest, but Dad said
Homer: Shut it.
Get up. Mow the lawn. Move it. On the double.
'Cause if you don't, you're in deep, deep trouble.

Back: Trouble.
Deep, deep trouble.
Run into trouble.
Bart: Where's your sense of humour, man?
Back: Deep, deep trouble.
