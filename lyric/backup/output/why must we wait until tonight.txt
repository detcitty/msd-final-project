Why must we wait until tonight?
Tell me why
Why must we wait until tonight?
You wanna take a little time
Wanna drink me like a fine wine
Like the book of love
Line by line
But I wanna play with you
Right now
Go all the way with you, Baby
And show you how
'Cause my body just can't say no
And fingers just won't let go
Tell me why
