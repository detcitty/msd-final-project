Oooh yeah, mmmm
Breakthrough

Up, down, spinnin all around
Fly, high, falling to the ground
Sometimes dreams can feel so far away

Time, keeps, skippin' out a beat
Left, right, trippin' on your feet
Life is like a string of cloudy days

Sometimes it's raisin' your voice
Sometimes it's makin' some noise
Sometimes it's proving to the world it was wrong
Whenever you can't see the light
Whenever there's no end in sight
Keep on, keep on moving on
Keep on moving on

Here comes a breakthrough
Here comes a day
Here comes a moment that you gotta go for it
So don't let it get away
It's all a breakthrough
Just turn the page
Cause everyday I'm getting closer
Life is just a rollercoaster

Shake it, till you make it
Till you break it all through
