Radio! 
I wake up in the morning
The first sound that I hear
Is that clock radio (RADIO) singing in my ear
I make it to the bathroom to brush my teeth
To that big city big beat
Jump into the shower, bring my box along
'Cause I know all the words to all the songs
DJ stops the music to announce the time
Time has come today

Grabbed my coat and grabbed my hat
Made my train in seconds flat
All the time I'm listening to my radio

Around the block, to the corner
You can hear it all night long
On the roof and out on Broadway
When the radio is on
You can rock around the clock
