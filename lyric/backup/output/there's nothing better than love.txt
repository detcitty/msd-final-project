I fell asleep late last night
And I dreamed the night and almost half the day away
I just got up so that I could hear her say
She's still in love and no one can take her love away

Ooh love wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one could ever make me feel this way
It feels me up every time I hear her say
She's still in love and no one will take her love away

I wanna be love, there's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of
