"Buy Anita Baker's CD
Just Because
Anita Baker
(Micheal O'Hara, Sami McKinney Alex Brown)

When I think about how much I'm loving you
No limitations, no set of regimented rules
I'm amazed how much this love has touched my life
And the commitment that we share is a welcome sacrifice

This must be, sweet fatal attraction
My life-long date with destiny
Love this strong, it just brings out the passion
I never knew was here in me
