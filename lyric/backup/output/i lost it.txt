I had a $100 ring in my hand,
so weak and tired,
i can bearly stand,
from being up all night,
prayin' she'd say yes.
so with a hopefull heart,
i hit one knee,
with a tear in her eye,
she looked at me,
it was the moment of truth,
i was scared to death.
my life hung on what that tear meant,
then she smiled at me,
and i lost it.
(chorus)
no one can make me cry,
make me laugh,
make me smile,
or drive me mad,
like she does.
