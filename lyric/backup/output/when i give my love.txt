When I give my love
When I give my love to you

When I give my love to you (Whoa'oh'), baby (My baby, baby)
I'll show you what love can do 'yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I give my love to you (When I give, when I give), baby (When I give love to you, baby, baby)
I'll show you what love can do (I will show you my love)

When I give my love to you

Hush, my baby, baby, don't say a word
I got so much love for you, girl, haven't you heard
Now I'm on a mission, girl, my intuition
Says you should be mine, I should be yours

When I give my love to you (When I lay, when I lay your body down), baby
I'll show you what love can do (I'll show you what a real love feels like, baby, yes, I will, girl)
When I give my love to you (And in the midnight hour, baby, in the midnight hour, baby), baby
