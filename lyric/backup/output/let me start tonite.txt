Do you remember the day
When you walked away
I never had a chance
To tell my story

I'd been out all night
Had too much to drink
And couldn't think

I just lost my job
And thought that I'd been robbed
And feeling lonely was to blame
For the lipstick stains

Just let me start tonight
Setting everything right
With you and me, baby
Ooh, wee

I'm not too proud to plead
I'll beg on bended knee
To get you back, baby
Yes, I will

You got me doing time
