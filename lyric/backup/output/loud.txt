Ladies and Gentleman
This is Macadelic
Mother Fucker

Ugh I got codeine in my cup, you can bet your ass I'm sippin'
Groupies fall in love, I'm like bitch you must be trippin'
I'm just tryna fuck and she just need tuition
Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck and nothing 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain
Yeah you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
But it don't make a difference if you cryin' in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'ma kill more
I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mil more
Play a number one spot on the billboard
