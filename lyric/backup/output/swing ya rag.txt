Swizzy, need y'all to take y'all rags out, man, T.I
And let it swang, swang, swang, swang
Let it swang, swang, swang, swang
Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in
the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in
the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Swang
New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag
Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag
Full of stacks rubber bands round big cash
Got a sick swag tell the haters get mad, come on
We in the club homes getting' our thug on
Bottles of Patron if you grown get your buzz on
We brought the broads out and brought the cars out
I'm like the moon I shine and bring the stars out
When it dark out, get the squad out
