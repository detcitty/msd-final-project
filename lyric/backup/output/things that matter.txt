Sometimes he lets that boss get in his head
He can't see past that mountain of deadlines on his desk
5 o'clock he's the last one out of the gate
And he gets cut off, flipped off, ticked off out on the interstate
And he wonders why this world won't leave him alone
Till he hears that little voice holler daddy's home
Things that matter
Things that don't
