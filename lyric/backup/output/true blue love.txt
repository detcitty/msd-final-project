Had enough of my yesterdays
I can't go back to mistakes that I've made
Had enough of my dark side
And the hard ride that we've been through
And now I've got so much to prove
So don't let go, I've been a heart-selfish fool
It's a feeling I'm rising above
I'll give you love, true love, true blue love
