Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute
Uh huh, sure, you know you look kinda familiar
Yeah, you do too but um... I just wanted to know
do you know somebody named... you know his name
Oh yeah definitely, I know his name
I just want to let you know that he's mine
Uh, no no, he's mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

I think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk, face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man
Are you insane

See I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me
He couldn't make it through the day
Ain't that a shame

Well maybe you misunderstood
