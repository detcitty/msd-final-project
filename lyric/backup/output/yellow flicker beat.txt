I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fire's found a home in me

I move through town, I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of hope, I tie it and untie it

And now people talk to me but nothing ever hits
So people talk to me and all the voices just burn holes

I'm done with it, ooh
