Oakenfold
Miscellaneous
Starry Eyed Suprise
Oooh La La
I see stars
I’m seeing stars x6
Once again, I find myself with my friends, dancing the night away,
Its like the party never ends.
Then again we don’t want it to stop, 'cause tonight’s the night it goes sweatbox, laser beams, flashing lights, wild cards,
Men from Mars, dressed in Stars and stripes,
Eclectic electric
Ladies of the evening
drinking booze and mingling ….
