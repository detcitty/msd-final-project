What's up boo?
Yeah, ha ha ha ha
Yeah

Another shady mission, tricks
Like watchin' pictures in hazy vision
Tonight it's love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we satisfy yesterday with stolen kisses

Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the death that they planned for me
If I have kids, will I live to see 'em grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug n*****
Until the day I go

No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven 'cause bein' here ain't livin'

Close my eyes and see nothin' but pain
The world's crazy, still lookin' for a queen
To plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious
If you play your cards right

I wanna be the one who, who you can depend on
Who, who'll be the one who'll be there through the thick and thin
Go by the water, we will be there to the mornin'
