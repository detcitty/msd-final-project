Generals and majors, uh-huh
They're never too far
From battlefields so glorious
Out in a world of their own
They'll never come down
'Til once again victorious
Woah, generals and majors always
Seem so unhappy 'less they got a war
Generals and majors, uh-huh
Like never before
Are tired of being actionless
