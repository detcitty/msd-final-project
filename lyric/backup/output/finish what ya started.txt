(One, two, one, two, three, four)

Come on, baby
Ow.

Wha-oh-a-wha-oh-wha-oh
Uh!

Oh, if you wanna see other guys
Baby, I could let it slide
You wanna lover, you want a friend
Mama I can be both of them I got the tools, to satisfy-uh
Just walk away
If I fall shy at all
Uh!

Come on baby, finish what ya started
I'm incomplete, huh!
That ain't no way to treat the broken-hearted
I need some sympathy!

I like to look at the long run
