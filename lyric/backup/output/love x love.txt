I remember the days when we never had a dime
And our dreams seemed a million miles away
But we made it baby, facin' the bad times with a smile
Here we are and we're growin' stronger day by day

'Cause we got love times love
It's always there for us to share
And girl it sure feels good
To know you're by my side

'Cause we're just two high hearts
That beat as one forever on
With love times love
To keep us satisfied every night

So my lady whisper the words I love to hear
