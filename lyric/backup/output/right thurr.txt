Uh, hey dirty (What)
Look at that girl right thurr (Oh)
She make me say
Ooh, ooh (Yea)
Ooh, ooh (Hey)
Do what you do
(C'mon boy)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Swing your hips when your walkin', let down your hurr
(Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)

Lick your lips when your talkin' that make me sturr
(Make me sturr)
I like the way you look in them pants, said ya fine (Fine)
Your momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime (Dime)
The type of girl that'll getcha up and go make you grind (Grind)
I'm thinkin' 'bout snatchin' her up, dirty, makin' her mine

Look at her hips (What?)
Look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (Stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (Back)

I like it when I touch it cuz she moan a l'il bit
Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong l'il bit
I know your grown a l'il bit, twenty years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the Regal
I swooped on her like an eagle swoopin' down on its pray
I know your popular, but you gon'be famous today
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Swing your hips when your walkin', let down your hurr
(Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick your lips when your talkin' that make me sturr (Make me sturr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Swing your hips when your walkin', let down your hurr
(Down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
