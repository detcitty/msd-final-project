Listen here
How we sing it in you ear

Oh, oh, oooh... 

Move your body, yeah, all right
Boogie body, let's dance all night
Move your body, yeah, all right
Boogie body, let's dance all night

Stretch out and let your body move
(Stretch out) you ain't got
Nothing but time

We're having a good time
(Good time, mighty fine good time)
You ain't got nothing to lose
