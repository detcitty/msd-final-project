All day I've been banging the walls
Like a prisoner in a cell
And if I don't get out I'm going to lose my mind
And there's more for me I'm tired of the same old scene

I can't wait to see that face to say goodbye, bye bye
I want to say goodbye
I got something inside of me
That I don't intend to waste

I've got dreams, baby I can't forget
