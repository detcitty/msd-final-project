Both sides are fightin'
you don't know who to choose
you're stuck in the middle
and you can't lose
both sides are talkin'
you've finally seen the light
you'll get it together
but not tonight
You were born with it
and now you got it
the way you want it
and you don't care
cause nothin's gonna bring you down
You were born with it
