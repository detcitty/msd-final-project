#67 in 1987

Sometimes she's undecided
Sometimes she just don't care
She thinks so one sided
She thinks looks are fair
Kick the wall

You try but can't quit her
What she wants God only knows
This love it doesn't fit her
She doesn't keep what she outgrows
Kick the wall

You dreamed that she loved you
You couldn't keep her away
