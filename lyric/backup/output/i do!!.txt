He was a six foot stallion said a storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket big fat rock in his ear
He made my heart stop palpitatin' every time he came near

He has a spankin' new range for that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin', he was plaided, and his head was cornrows
He has his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bow
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control

'Cause I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control
'Cause I do
