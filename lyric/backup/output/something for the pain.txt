Happiness, it's been no friend to me
But forever after ain't what it's all cracked up to be
Yeah, I had a taste, you were my fantasy
But I almost lost my faith when I hit reality

I don't need no Guru to tell me what to do
When your feeling like a headline on yesterday's news

Come on, come on, come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right,
Something like you
Come on, come on, come on
