Running around in
The towns and cities
There are millions of people
Without a face

Don't you be sad and
Don't you think it's a pity
This is the way of the human race

Running around and
Trying to find a reason
For carrying on until the
Day that they die

Looking for answers
From season to season
Looking so hard that it is
