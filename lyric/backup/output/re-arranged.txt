Just think about it.
Just think about it.

Lately I've been sceptical, silent when I would used to speak,
Distant from all around me who witness me fail and become weak.
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown,
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down.

But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain,
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change.
