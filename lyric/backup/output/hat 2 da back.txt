Rap intro

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you

Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free and you better believe i'll
Do what pleases me

Yo left eye kick the scene

See everyday last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up knock knock til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo just to let you know, it's takin' ta
