Well, just look at that girl
With the lights comin' up in her eyes
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby

All the guys on the corner stand back
And let her walk on by
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
She's got to be somebody's baby
She's so fine

She's probably somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's probably somebody's baby, all right
