Whispering our goodbyes
Waiting for the train
I was dancing with my baby
In the summer rain

I can hear him saying
"Nothing will change
Come dance with me, baby
In the summer rain"

I remember the rain
On his skin
And his kisses hotter
Than the Santa Ana winds

Whispering our goodbyes
Waiting for the train
I was dancing with my baby
In the summer rain

I remember laughing
Till we almost cried
There at the station that night
I remember looking in his eyes
