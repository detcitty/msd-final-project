I went to a garden party
To reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories
And play our old songs again
When I got to the garden party
They all knew my name
But no one recognized me
I didn't look the same
But it's all right now
I learned my lesson well
You see, you can't please everyone
So you got to please yourself
People came from miles around
