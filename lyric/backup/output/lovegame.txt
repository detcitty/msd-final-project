Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

I wanna kiss you
But if I do, then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A LoveGame, a LoveGame

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it

Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans the LoveGame
