Did you see any action?
Did you make any friends?
Would you like some affection
Before I leave again?

Well, I've been walking behind you
Since you've been able to see
There's never been any reason
For you to think about me

Did you have any bad dreams?
Did you break any glass?
Would you be my companion
Is there even a chance?

You've been talking in circles
Since I've been able to cry
There's never been any reason
