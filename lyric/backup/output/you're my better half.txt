Car door slams, it's been a long day at work
I'm out on the freeway and I'm wondering if it's all worth
The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair
I pull into the drive and you're standing there.

And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all gonna be alright
You take my hand
You pull me close
And you hold me tight.

Chorus:
It's the sweet love that you give to me
