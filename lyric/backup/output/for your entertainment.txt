So hot out the box
Can we pick up the pace?
Turn it up, heat it up
I need to be entertained
Push the limit, are you with it, baby don't be afraid
Imma hurt you real good baby
Let's go, it's my show, baby, do what I say
Don't trip off the glitz that I'm gonna display
I told you, Imma hold ya down until you're amazed
Give it to ya till you're screamin' my name
No escaping when I start
Once I'm in I own your heart
There's no way to ring the alarm
So hold on until it's over

Do you know what you got into
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?
