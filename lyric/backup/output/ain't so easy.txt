We can stay
Or we can move along
Either way don't leave me all alone
I'm sorry about your eye
I'll find a way to make amends
It's only that sometimes
I've got to break before I bend

Come on darling there's a show downtown tonight
Let's go out dancing we can drink until the light
I know I haven't been
Everything a man should be
But I promise I will change
You just leave that up to me
