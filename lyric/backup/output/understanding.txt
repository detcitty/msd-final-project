Mmm... mmm... mmm... mmm...
Mmm... mmm... mmm... mmm...
Mmm... mmm... mmm...
What I need from you is understanding

How can we communicate
If you don't hear what I say (Mmm... mmm... mmm... mmm...)
What I need from you is understanding
So simple as 1-2-3

Understanding is what we need
You don't even know me
You just wanna do what you wanna do
That's not the way it should be, no

You should listen to me, boy {You better listen to me, boy}
I try so very hard
To make you understand
But the choices you make

Baby, they're old to me, oh
I try so very hard
To keep our love alive

But you don't wanna meet me half way
Then the understanding dies
There's no way that we can work it out
If we don't pull together
I don't mean to be demanding
