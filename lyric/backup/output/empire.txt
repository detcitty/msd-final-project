Take off all of your skin
I'm brave when you're free
Shake off all of your sins
Then give them to me

Close up, let me back in
I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
And my heart beats

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You're my wildfire every single night
We are alive

And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me
And I'm like
And I'm like
And I'm like

Hooooo, hooooo
