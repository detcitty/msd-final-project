To be blessed with forgetfulness
Oh yes
To be glad to be alive
Like a bee out of the hive
I don't know how I have survived
But here I am (Here I am)
It's a California day (California day)
California weather (California weather)
Take the clouds away (take the clouds away)
I feel a whole lot better
California day

There's nothing like the sunshine
