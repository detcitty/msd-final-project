You Wanna Get Out of Jam

Nation To Nation
All The World Must Come Together
Face The Problems That We See
Then Maybe Somehow We Can Work It Out
I Asked My Neighbor For A Favor
She Said Later
What Has Come Of All The People

Have We Lost Love Of What It's About

I Have To Find My Peace Cuz

No One Seems To Let Me Be
False Prophets Cry Of Doom

What Are The Possibilities
I Told My Brother There'll Be Problems

Times And Tears For Fears
We Must Live Each Day

Like It's The Last

Go With It Go With It

Jam
It Ain't Too Much Stuff
It Ain't Too Much

It Ain't Too Much For Me To
Jam
It Ain't
It Ain't Too Much Stuff

It Ain't
Don't You
It Ain't Too Much For Me To
