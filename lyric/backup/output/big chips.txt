Big chips! We off in Vegas drinkin' and partyin'
We got chicks in swimsuits modelin'
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dippin' low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical

You know them boys got the clubs out of control
Nigga what ya heard it's Kells and Hov
With the second comin' of best of both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talkin'

Big chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga
Big cribs and the whips is spacious
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig

No reward that's the risk is taken
In which case you niggaz wouldn't wanna switch places
I on the other hand relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious

I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this

Nigga I pray for some shit like this
Word to my Uncle Ray
Who gave us life for some shit like this
Ma you rollin' I'm as real as it gets

Big chips! We off in Vegas drinkin' and partyin'
We got chicks in swimsuits modelin'
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dippin' low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
