Ah-ha-ha, ah-aah
Ah-ha-ha, ah-aah
Ah-ha-ha
Keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
I keep thinking, a-aah

Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
'Cause he always used to look at me that way
Then I thought maybe I should walk right up to her
And say, "Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play"

Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price
