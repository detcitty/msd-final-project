If anybody know
I know
Yeah

Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it

Oh yeah, Magic city on a Monday
Esco treat that shit like church on Sunday
Niggas look at us like â€˜maybe one day'
Maybe one day, maybe one day
But for now a nigga got the ones with me
I be in the club with the bands
Like I got the keyboard and the drums with me
Maybe one day, maybe one day
You will understand how I get it though
Man, it's everything I ever said it is
Mix the liquors, course, with the sedatives
I roll up with the bands on me
