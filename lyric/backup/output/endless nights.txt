Lover, i just can`t believe it`s turned
you`re tearing my life apart
there`s no simple answer
Here i am, just standing in circles
and the logic is turning me round
my mind keeps holding
only one thought
When you gonna call
i think it`s worth the time
how you gonna change
all these endless nights
If you could stop
leading me around
you`re never gonna change
