Yeah, yeah I need a, I want a

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride, I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine, oh mine, I need a girl in my life

Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few you would like to bone

But chicks, don't romance me, don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy, that's not what my plans be
I need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go to trips at the Lancy, trip to the Grammy's

'Cause most of these girls be confusin' me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin' me
Here's the money or maybe you ain't used to me
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusin' me

That's why I need a girl that be true to me
Know bout the game and know how to do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit I ruin me
Forget the word, it's just you and me

Now let's ride

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride, I need a girl to make my wife
