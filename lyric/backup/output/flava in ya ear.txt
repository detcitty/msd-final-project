"yo mack i don't even understand how they didn't understand you in
That mary joint!"
"yeah i know man."
"kick that ol' robotic futuristic george jetson crazy joint!"

Just... like... uniblab robotic kickin' flab
My flavor be the badder
Chitter chatter
Madder than the mad hatter (1)
I bet you my shit come out fatter
Got the data
To turn your body into antimatter (2) {...body into antimatter...}
And just like a piece of sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach
With the eggs and grits between {...take 'em down, mack...}
The king is what i mean
I mean
My man get a cup
And put some change inside your hand {...take 'em down, mack...}
Now hold up,
Let's make this official {...make it official}
Everybody let's agree that m.c.'s need a tissue {.wake 'em up}
The funk's my only issue,
I bet your mama miss you
And i bet the mack take off like an m.x. missile
No more of your whining
On the charts climbing
As i make the funk
Kickin' out more harder than a diamond {...harder than a diamond}
And if you didn't know who's rhyming
I guess i'm gonna say craig mack
With perfect timing

.you won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear {...kick it down!}

Chorus:
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
{...brand new flava in ya ear...}
[time for new flava in ya ear]

I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
