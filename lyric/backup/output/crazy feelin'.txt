Don't ever stop, don't ever stop, no no no
Don't ever stop this crazy feelin'

I love you so you'll never know
Don't ever stop believin'
Out of the minds time after time
It's such a crazy feelin'

Feelin' good, feelin' high
Feel so free I wanna fly
Feel the sun, feel the ground
Feel it just go round and round and round

And I wanna stay day after day
And just a little bit longer
You close to me I gotta be
You know the love gets stronger and stronger
