Can't stop dancin'
Just because the music's gone
Hey hey, can't stop dancin', no just because the band
Has packed up and gone home

Can't stop dancin' just because the music's gone
'Cause if you keep on dancin'
If you keep on dancin', hey if you keep on dancin'
You're gonna turn the music back on

There's a rhythm in the universe
And the music is always there
But whenever things go wrong
Sometimes it's so hard to bear
