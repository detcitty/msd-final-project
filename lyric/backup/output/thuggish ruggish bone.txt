We're not against rap
We're not against rappers
But we are against those thugs...
(thugs thugs...)

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

Your feelin' the strength of the rump
Step up, hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin, straight buzzin, lovin yo peoples cause we so real
Chill, better bring yo weapon, when steppin
Bring on that ammunition, trippin' on sip
Not to mention, never knew no competition
But i gotta get mine, so scream out, mo, and let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the bone, mo' thugs will follow
Chain gang, remains the same
Flamin my dank and drinkin brew
Thinkin about hangin, clockin my bank, and thuggin trues, foo's

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
