This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away, I feel you're gonna stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that go
Bringing you back again, hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love that I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going cause

I love you, yes I do, this old heart
I love you, yes I do, yes I do, wait for me
