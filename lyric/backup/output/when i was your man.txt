Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now,
our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
when our friends talk about you
all it does is just tear me down
cause my heart breaks a little
when I hear your name

It all just sounds like oh,
too young, too dumb to realize
that I should've bought you flowers
and held your hand
should I gave you all my hours
when I had the chance
take you to every party
