I saw these fools tryin' to get around, tryin to let me down
And all dat, ha, but I got an easier way to let dem drown
Wit these Guns of Navarrone, I shall shoot dem like Al Capone
Take dem to the zones of bones, like dat, well

Yo dunn, they tried to knock me down, bury me under
Big pipes soundin' like thunder
Skated by the skin of my teeth
I had to put a man in his place last week

Now why you wanna come at me?
I'm the wrong nigga to approach like that, homes
Wrong nigga for threats
Lone nigga wit long chrome

And we can dance till one of us drop
You score points fallin' wit good formation
I'm the wrong nigga for patience, wrong one at dunn
The very last nigga you should ever blast your gun
