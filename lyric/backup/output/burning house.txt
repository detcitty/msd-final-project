I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside
I couldn't get you out
I laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke

Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broken
Make it right
I've been sleepwalking
