A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher,
Ridin' on a midnight bus bound for Mexico.
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education,
And two of them were searchin' for lost souls.
That driver never ever saw the stop sign.
An' eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime.

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway,
