It's a Midwest thang y'all
And ain't got a clue
(Ain't got a clue)
Why my cutlass blue
And I got them thangs on that motherfucker too
It's a Midwest swang y'all
Ain't gotta trip
(Ain't gotta trip)
While we swing and dip
'Cuz we do big thangs on the motherfuckin' hip

What you think, we live on a farm? Nigga, be for real
We got Benz's, Rovers and Jag's, Hummer's and Deville's
Got a green S Class, ain't broke the do' seal
Shit ain't been the same since I signed fo' reel
This shit got ill, when I hit 4 mil
Five and countin', dirty six at will
Did seven on the slide, 8 worldwide
I'll be on my third Bentley by the time I'm at 9

I hear 'em cryin', "You gon' sell out"
Ya damn right, I done sold out before and re-caught the same night
Straight hopped the next flight, too icey for sunlight
Dunkin' without sprite, yeah you heard me dirty
I'm from the Show-Me State, show me seven I'll show you eight
Karats in one bling, heavily starched jeans
Representin' St. Louis every time I breathe
In the city I touch down, and I bob and weave, ay

It's a Midwest thang y'all
And ain't got a clue
(Ain't got a clue)
Why my cutlass blue
And I got them thangs on that motherfucker too
It's a Midwest swang y'all
Ain't gotta trip
