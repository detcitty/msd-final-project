There's a trail of smoke comin' out of a bottle
If you look real close, you can see it right there
A little tin roof bar down a path you have to follow
From a treasure map with the edges burnt from a few too many beers

We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw 'em up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our god
No we don't need no clock

We'll set sail
