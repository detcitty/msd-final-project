Well, you're a fine sexy little lady
You like your candy very sweet
You're a classy little dame, with sophisticated game
And you know all of the best restaurants to eat, uh-huh

And you're as rare as vintage wine
I'll take you any place fit into your time and space
That's why I chose to make you mine, uh-huh
