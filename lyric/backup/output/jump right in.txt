The Southern wind sings again an island lullaby

Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling
And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning
And the ship is off to sea
And the wake it is a churning
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby

You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
