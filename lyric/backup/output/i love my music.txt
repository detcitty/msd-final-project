Well when you listen to the music
Does it make you want to sing?
Or does it make you want to dance to the heavy beated brains?
Deep down in my soul
Deep down in my bones
Sometimes I get the feeling you're so deep I can't let go
But I, I guess I'm gonna be love you more
Start making em', heart breaking, I kill the ladies with my song
Riding high I'm kinda crazy
Maybe fool is what it seems
The only thing that gets me high is when I'm playing in the scene
