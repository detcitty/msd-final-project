Jeannie Ortega, Papoose
Let me show you how it's supposed to be done

Don't get me started, it's getting kinda crowded in here
Back up off me, I'm feeling like I'm suffocating
Now here's my problem, I'm not gon' be your chick on the side
Forget about it, you know damn well it wouldn't be right

I don't know what you've been thinking about me
Did u think this was gon' be that easy?
Hell no, you must be going crazy

Why don't you get outta my life
Get outta my sight, get off of my back?
Why don't you get back to your world
Go back to your girl, I think you owe her?

I know what's going on
I won't be second to none
