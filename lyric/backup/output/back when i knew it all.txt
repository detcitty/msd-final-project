At the ripe old age of nineteen
i bought a short bed pick up chicks machine
life ran on beer and gasoline
a half a lap ahead of the law
i had a fake i d that got me into "tuffies"
love was a word i used to get lucky
was a big time spender with that plastic money
back when i knew it all

Back when the world was flat and
mama and daddy didn't have a clue
that was back
back when a pitcher of beer and a
couple shots made me bulletproof
