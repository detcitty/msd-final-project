I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room

Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream

Where I stand and say
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
