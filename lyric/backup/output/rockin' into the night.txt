Ooh rockin'
Ohh yeah

Cruisin' down the motorway
Got my girl by my side
We're both a little anxious
Ooo, we got love on our mind

Waitin', anticipatin'
For the fireworks in the night
Well I swear we were doin' eighty
When we saw those motel lights

And we were rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
(Ooo hoo rockin')
Rockin' into the night
Rockin' into the night
