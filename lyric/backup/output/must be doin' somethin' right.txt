A woman is a mystery
A man just can't understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand

An' other times you gotta take it slow
An' hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong

Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
Ya lean into my kiss
