Now you been holding me down
For such a long time now
From back then to now in my story
Straight from the hood, you've always been there for me

And you had my back when they
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything
It was you that kept me holding on
No matter what was going on
So whatever you need I got you, yeah

Reminiscing that 6 train from way back
Now it's sky blue Phantoms and stretch Maybacks
For sweepin' them floors in them Bronx apartments
Mira esta que ta on the red carpet

When Pun died you was the first to call me
I never told you but you was there for me
Whatever you need, I be there for you
Crack, I got ya back, for real, true story

Now my loyalty will always be
With you if you just promise me
That you'll stay real just like you are
'Cause baby you don't have to change no
