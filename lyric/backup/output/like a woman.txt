I don't know, what I do to you,
But I find myself at the East river, waiting to meet with you,
Late at night, I keep dreaming of you,
We're making love, on the sofa, that belongs to you.

We fly higher than kites, when we're face to face,
Searching for time, alone, in this here violent place,
We don't know who we are, or why we've met,
That is strangely good, in some sort of freakish way.
