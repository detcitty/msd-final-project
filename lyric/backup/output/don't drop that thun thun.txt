Okay is the rula
Night man cooka
Keep me a rooka
Pop me a pupa
The Heat is where I grew up
So It's what I threw up

Sicker than a mothafucka,
Might throw my food up
Hoop coola no one losers
You had good brains
I ain't even had to school her
Meet me at 2'tha
I just want to do her
Pass it to the inc.
And let my bro screw her

I'm killin and I'll be that way
I got a large appetite for some pussy and weed
