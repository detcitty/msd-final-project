Suck it nigga, we don't
Get down like y'all

Hey, it's been a lot of back and forth over this and that
So I don't pick the bobo no more, I just get it, fact
Listen, pimpin', let me tell you what the business here
Y'all don't know some so I'ma tell you what the difference here

See, we're old school, you're just old news
We used to move blow, and you just blow dude
See we the talk of the town, me and my whole crew
You run around town gossip, like the hoes do

See you namedrop when nobody knows you
We get the lames out our section, like we 'posed to
My crew, we cop the Bentley, Brooklyn and the Rolls too
You give her roses I'm the one she bring the rose to

So you say you're shining, well I guess I'm shining more
