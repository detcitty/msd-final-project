We had our life, we had our love
But you don't know what you've got till you lose it
Well that was then and this is now
And I want you back, how many times can I say I'm sorry
Yes I'm sorry

How can something so good go so bad
How can something so right go so wrong
I don't know, I don't have all the answers
