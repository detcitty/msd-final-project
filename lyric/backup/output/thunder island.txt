Ooh, yeah

(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do)

Sha, la, la, la, la, la, my lady
In the sun with your hair undone
Can you hear me now
Callin' your name from across the bay?
A summer's day laughin' and a-hidin'
Chasin' love out on Thunder Island

(Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
