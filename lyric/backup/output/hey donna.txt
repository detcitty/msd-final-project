Hey Donna
Rhythm Syndicate
(Sturken/Rogers)

Yeah!
Listen up

First time I saw you
You were different than the rest
The way you walked into the room
The way you wore that dress
I did everything to impress you
Trying all my favorite lines
But you looked into my eyes and
Cut me down to size
Said you don't play for keeps
Then don't waste my time

Hey Donna
Why you wanna do me like that
