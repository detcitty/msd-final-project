Vibing to the music this is how we do it all night (all night)
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music Music

Would have came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing.

When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the walls
Automatic weapons on the floor but who can you call?
My dime bitch one that live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms so body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in a rental
I love a nasty girl that swallows whats on the menu
My money triples up when you get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elory Jetson I'm somewhere out of space
In my two seater she's the one that I would take
