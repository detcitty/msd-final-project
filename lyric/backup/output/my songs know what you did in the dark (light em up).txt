Oh woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh woah oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

B-b-b-be careful making wishes in the dark,
dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark,
mark

And besides in the mean, mean time-ime
I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the
devil
So now the world can never get me on my
level

I just gotta get you off the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

My songs know what you did in the dark...
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
