Hi

Hey baby, is that you?
Wow, your hair got so long
Yeah, yeah, I love it, I really do
Norma Jean, ain't that the song we'd sing in the car
Drivin' downtown, top down, makin' the rounds
Checking out the bands on Doheny Avenue

Yeah, life throws you curves
But you've learned to swerve
Me, I swung and I missed
And the next thing ya know, I'm reminiscing
Dreaming old dreams, wishing old wishes
Like you would be back again

I wake up and teardrops that fall down like rain
