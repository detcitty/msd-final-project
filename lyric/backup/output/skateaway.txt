I seen a girl on a one-way corridor
Stealing down a wrong-way street
For all the world like an urban toreador
She had wheels on, on her feet
Well, the cars do the usual dances
Same old cruise and the curbside crawl
But the roller girl, she's taking chances
They just love to see her take them all

No fear alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

Hallelujah, here she comes, queen rollerball
And enchant√©, what can I say, don't care at all
You know, she used to have to wait around
She used to be the lonely one
But now that she can skate around town
She's the only, only one
