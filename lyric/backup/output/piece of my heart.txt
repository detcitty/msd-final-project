Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only one?
And didn't I give you everything I could
Well didn't I get it to you now, baby?

After all the love I gave you
There was never enough
Well I'm gonna show ya baby
That this man can get tough

Just come on, come on, come on, come on
And (take a)
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
(Oh, break a)
Break another little piece of my heart and throw it away
(Oh, take a)
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
You know you got it
