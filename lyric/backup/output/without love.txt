All night long
One night, I could not sleep
For ringing in my ear
A melody began to sing

Oh, at first
The words I could not make out clear
The smog fields lifted away
And this is what I heard them say

It said without love
(Without love)
There's nothing you can do
Yes, it did
It said without love
(Without love)
You're not even you

All night long
He spoke to me
The words of wisdom rang
Beneath his sweet, soft melody

It said, don't you know
(Don't you know)
