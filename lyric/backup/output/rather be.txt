We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me, there's no place I rather be
I would wait forever, exulted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat

With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
