Every day I drive to work across Flint River bridge
A hundred yards from the spot where me and grandpa
fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand on the side of
Sawmill Road
He'd be there peelin' peaches if it was twenty years ago

And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talks
