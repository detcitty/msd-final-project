My yesterdays are all boxed up and neatly put away
But every now and then you come to mind
â€ Cause you were always waiting to be picked to play the game
But when your name was called, you found a place to hide
When you knew that I was always on your side

Well everything was easy then, so sweet and innocent
My demons and my angels reappeared
