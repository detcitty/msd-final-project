I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
('Cause all you ever do is make me)

Gave you up 'bout 21 times
Felt those lips tell me 21 lies (yeah)
You'll be the death of me
Sage advice
Love, lovin' you could make Jesus cry

When I hear you sayin', "Darlin'
Your kiss is like an antidote"
I'm fightin' like I'm Ali
But you got me on the ropes
