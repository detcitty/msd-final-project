Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said "it's over with" that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
"Goodnight it's over with" that's all she wrote

it's stupid how I go in knowing everybody knowing that I'm
Sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it
Eventually see they can't beat then with me they join
Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
it's on the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishing they were this hot
Guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off (so)
Better that than pissed on
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone
High stepping prime time
Thought you niggas been on
Ain't no blocking my shine
Like my new air Yeezy's you can see me in the night time
