I can do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Do the pretty girl rock, rock, rock
Now what's your name?

My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry lookin' at my derriere
You can stare but if you touch it I'ma bury

Pretty as a picture
Sweeter than a swisher
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya
I ain't gotta talk about it, baby you can see it
But if you want, I'll be happy to repeat it

My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly oh my it's a little bit scary
Boys wanna marry lookin' at my derriere
You can stare but if you touch it I'ma bury

Pretty as a picture (picture)
Sweeter than a swisher (swisher)
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too then ladies sing with me

All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a 10
