I rode around long enough with my windows down
Let that breeze roll in, carry your perfume out
I took your number and messages off my phone
Ah, but you ain't gone

Wish I could close my eyes
And not have to see you smilin' yeah
Yeah, can't get you outta my head

You're dancin' all around it
Girl, you got me surrounded yeah
Yeah, can't get you outta my head

I got you off of these walls
I got you out of my bed
