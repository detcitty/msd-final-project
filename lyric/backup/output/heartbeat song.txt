This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up, all night long

Up up all night long
You, where the hell did you come from
You're a different, different kind of fun
And i'm so used to feeling numb
Now, I got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come

Like a finger on a loaded gun
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me

Haven't felt it for a long time
