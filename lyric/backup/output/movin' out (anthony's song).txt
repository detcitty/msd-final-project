Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said
"Sonny, move out to the country."
Oh but workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack-ack-ack-ack
You oughta know by now
Who needs a house out in Hackensack?
Is that all you get for your money?
