Timbo.

Hey, Ne-Yo.
Say what? Lo-So.
Hey, hey.
I'm a movement by myself.

But I'm a force when we're together.

Mami I'm good all by myself.
But baby you, you make me better.
You make me better.
You make me better.
You make me better.
You make me better.
You make me better.
You make me better.
You make me better.
You make me better.
You plus me, it equals better math.
Ya boy a good look but, she my better half.

I'm already bossin', already flossin'.

But why I have the cake if it ain't got the sweet frostin'? (yep yep yep yep).
Keepin' me on my A game (what what what what).
Without havin' the same name (that that that that that).
They may flame (but but but but).
But shawty, we burn it up.
The sag in my swag, pep in my step.
Daddy do the Gucci, mami in Giuseppes.
Guess it's a G thing, whenever we swing.
I'mma need Coretta Scott, if I'm gonna be King.
I'm a movement by myself.
But I'm a force when we're together.
Mami I'm good all by myself.

But baby you, you make me better.
