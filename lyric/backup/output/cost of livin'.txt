Everything to know about me

Is written on this page

The number you can reach me

My social and my age

Yes I served in the army

It's where I learned to shoot

Eighteen months in the desert

Pourin' sand out of my boots

No I've never been convicted of a crime

I could start this job at any time.

I got a strong back

Steel toes

I rarely call in sick
