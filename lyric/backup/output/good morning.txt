I want to show all of my haters love (hey!)
This song's for you (this song's for you)
If you had it like me and I was in your shoes
I'd probably hate on me too
See when you're gettin big cash stacks, all the haters hate that
'Cause they hate to see you be successful
I want to show all of my haters love
So I wave to you like "good morning"
Ha-ha-ha-ha-haters, good morning
Ha-ha-ha-ha-haters, good morning
Yeah, today gonna be "A Good Day", I'm feelin like I'm Ice Cube

I'm wakin up like can't nobody mess up my mood
Knowin I'm a boss, I'm a do what I choose
If I was you then I would probably (hate of me too)
If it's true (true), that money is time, then watch this
Ain't tryin to run out of time, so I purchase some watches
Y'all sick, the chips got the haters nauseous
They chicks jumpin in my whip like a mosh pit
I wish (wish) I could be effected by any hate but I can't (can't)
