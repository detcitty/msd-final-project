Imagine seeing him on the town holding another hand
She's staring me down so I figure that he told her who I am
But it don't matter either way what they do or say
Cause ain't nothing changed
He's standing with her but his soul is calling out my name

In my mind I'll always be his lady
In my mind I'll always be his girl

Saw his mama just the other said he'd been through a spell
