Verse 1:
Grab ya head nigga, start bobbin it, the underground's
Bein shook down PMDs robbin it, so crack all gold yeah,
And spark the phillie blunts, im chumpin niggaz down
Takin minds on a manhunt (po-po kid), don't get caught
Up in the gunsmoke, it's rap artin season, and im blastin
Niggaz who show-off, with that pretty-boy R&B rap, back
With a hiphop track, say that, cause that's whack, and
Niggaz aint trying to hear that, can't get sidetracked
