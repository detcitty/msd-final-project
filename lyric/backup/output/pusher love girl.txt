Hey little mama,
Ain't gotta ask me if I want to
Just tell me can I get a light
Roll you up and let it run through my veins

Cause I can always see the furthest stars
When I'm on you

And I don't wanna ever come down
Off this cloud of loving you
Now you got me hopped up on that

(Pusher love)
So high I'm on the ceiling baby

(You're my drug)

So go on and be my dealer babe
(Roll me up)
Cause all I want is you babe, yeah
One more time
(Pusher love)
So high I'm on the ceiling baby

(Be my drug)
So go on and be my dealer babe
(me up)

Cause all I want is you baby, yeah
You're my little pusher love girl,
Ain't ya?
Just my little pusher love girl

Now hey little mama
I love this high we're on to
And I know that your supply
Won't run out anytime soon
Cause you gave me a taste
Now I know that there's no getting off you
And I don't wanna ever come down off this cloud of lovin' you

Now you got me hopped up on that

(Pusher love)
So high I'm on the ceiling baby
(You're my drug)
So go on and be my dealer babe
(Roll me up)

Cause all I want is you babe, yeah
One more time
(Pusher love)
