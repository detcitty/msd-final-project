Last night I
I saw you standing
and I started, started pretending
I knew you and you knew me too
And just like a roni
You were too shy
But you weren't the only 'cause so was I
And I've dreamed of you ever since
Now I've built up my confidence
The next, next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say

Can we talk for a minute
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute
Girl I want to know your name

I started to write you letters
But I wanted to be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you
