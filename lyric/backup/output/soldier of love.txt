So you heard that I'm a rebel with a heart made of stone
I got a restless spirit that nobody can own
If a picture tells a story won't you listen to mine
I'm searching for the answer but it's so hard to find

You'll see much deeper when you read between the lines
'Cause there's a fire burning in my eye

Like a thief in the night who can't get enough
I am willing to fight 'cause I'm a soldier of love
Like a shot in the dark when the going gets rough
It's a state of the heart, you're a soldier of love
