Break it to them gently when you tell my mom and dad
When you see my baby sister, be as kind as you can
And break it to my grandma, who said "That boy's wild and bad"
Break it to them gently when you tell them that I won't be comin' home again

'Cause I'm running with a gun and it isn't any fun as a fugitive
Fighting for my life and I don't know if I'll make it alone
Running with a gun and it isn't any fun as a fugitive
God, I wanna go home
Lord, I wish I was home

When you see my lady with the twinkle in her eyes
Tell it to her softly and hold her if she cries
