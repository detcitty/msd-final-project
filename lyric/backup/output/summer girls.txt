Yeah, I like it when the girls stop by in the summer
Do you remember, do you remember
When we met that summer?

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer

Hip Hop Marmalade spic and span
Met you one summer and it all began
Your the best girl that I ever did see
The great Larry Bird Jersey 33

When you take a sip, you buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willy Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
Somethin' in your eyes went and drove me crazy

Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and never came back
Stayed all summer then went back home
Macauly Culkin wasn't Home Alone

Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'
Michael J Fox was Alex P Keaton
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
