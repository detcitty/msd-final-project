(Richie McDonald/Ron Harbin/Don Pfrimmer)

Oh, yeah...

Lost my job, came home mad
Got a hug and a kiss and "that's too bad"
She said, "I can go to work until you find another job"
I thought, I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hard-working dad to being Mr. Mom

Chorus:
Well...
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
