Eighteen years had come and gone
For Momma they flew by
But for me they drug on and on

We were loadin' up that Chevy
Both tryin' not to cry
Momma kept on talkin', puttin' off goodbye
Then she took my hand and said
”Baby don't forget”

”Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
And there's a fifty in the ashtray
