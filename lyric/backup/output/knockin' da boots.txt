Well... yeah... yeah...

Yeah
We're doin' this one for all the ladies, huh
H-Town Boys kickin' it with my boy Luke
For the 9-3, you know what I', sayin'
‘Cause we will be knockin' boots
GI, Shazam, Dino
They gon' do a little somethin' for you real sexy
Like you know what I'm sayin'
Hey, yo, check the verse

Last night I thought to back
When we made good love
Listenin' to some Marvin Gaye
All night long

Now I want that old flame back
Make these moments once again comfort
So won't you, won't you, mmm
Do it for us, babe

Good lovin', body rockin' all night long, yeah
Makin' love until we tire to the break of dawn
But oh, come on, come on and turn the lights down, and let me get on it, yeah
‘Cause when I do, just me and you, it'll be so right
