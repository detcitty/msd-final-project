Yo a party ain't a party 'till it's ran all through
And leave it to my crew it's gon' be playa' proof
After three rounds we gon' blow off this roof
A party ain't a party 'til it's ran all through

Now a party ain't a party 'till it's ran all through
And leave it to my crew it's gon' be playa' proof
After three rounds we gon' blow off this roof
A party ain't a party 'til it's ran all through

Shorty who you be you're starin' at me instantly
As I walk into this video I can feel you diggin' me
Wit' yo' glass of Remy, you had one too many
But still I'm impressed wit' cho' wild out Henney

It's a party and I got's to run all through
But maybe later on we can chat over booze
See I thought you knew, ain't no delayin' what I'm sayin'
Want me to rewind and collect on my track, it won't wait

I said it's a party, I got's to run all through
We holdin' 20 plus we can follow if you choose
See ain't nothin' changed, since the days of the Q
Except uh, elimination that wanna chew up my crew

Yes you, but you true I got to browse on through
You can catch me at the bar bein' shady to my old crew
How I do? Make moves like I shoot
Catch me on the rebound, or maybe at the tummy

Yo a party ain't a party 'till it's ran all through
And leave it to my crew it's gon' be playa' proof
After three rounds we gon' blow off this roof
A party ain't a party 'til it's ran all through

Now a party ain't a party 'till it's ran all through
And leave it to my crew it's gon' be playa' proof
