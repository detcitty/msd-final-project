Ten percent of something
(Ten percent of that something)
Ten percent of something
It beats one hundred percent
Of nothing at all

I only see you
Maybe once or twice a week
(Once or twice a week)
You make it worth my while
You treat me like a king
(Treat me like a king)

I cherish any time
That I can spend with you
Just say the words
And I'll do anything
But you must be true, oh

Ten percent of something
(Ten percent of that something, baby)
Ten percent of something
It beats one hundred percent
Of nothing at all
