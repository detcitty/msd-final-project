Happy birthday

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it
They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain't never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

You ain't gotta question it
