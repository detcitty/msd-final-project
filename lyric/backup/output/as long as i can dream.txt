When this world that I see
Is too hard to take
And too much for me
And everything's in blue

When the rain's pourin' down
And I can't find the sun
Don't mean the sun can't be found
It always comes through

There's not a soul that's lost
That can't find its way
There's not a night that's long
That can't find the day

As long as I can dream
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
I see it shinin'

And in my dreams, I see
There's a better world
Oh, there's a better world
As long as I can dream

In my heart there's a place
Where there's always hope
And always a way
