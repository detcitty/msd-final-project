You were too bad for a little square town
With your hip hop hat and your pants on the ground
Heard you cussed out mama, pushed daddy around
You tore off in his car

Here you are runnin' these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the hood here snowed but you can't fool me
We both know who you are

Homeboy, you're gonna wish one day
You were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
