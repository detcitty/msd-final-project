Thinkin' back in time
When love was only in my mind
I realize ain't no second chance
You've got to hold on to romance

Don't let it slide
There's a special kind of magic in the air
When you find another heart that needs to share

Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm, oh so glad, I found you

Need you ev'ry day
Gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay
'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you

Spendin' ev'ry dime
To keep you talkin' on the line
That's how it was
And all those walks together

Out in any kind of weather
