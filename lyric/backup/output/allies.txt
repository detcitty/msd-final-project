in troubled times
it's hard to get straight answers
between the lines
that border wrong or right
the homeland cries
it struggles with confusion
but this feelin' still remains
like shelter from the rain

we live of faith
in the hands of those who guide us
and tear the page
on the fear we left behind
we set the pace
