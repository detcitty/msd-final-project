[Big Punisher]
You can catch me in the cherry red one-fifty
Got the grizzy locked in the stizzy
Pop the clizzy goin sixty down a one-wizzy
Drunk pissy, tryin to cruise through the avenue
While my peoples is poppin bottles up inÂ ? Sue's rendevous?
Fuck that, spun the U-ey lost a hubcap
It's back to the shack - came back and now, "What's that?"
Straight from Paris, checkin Gaby's new baby carriage
Perry Ellis (nice), auburn cherry reddish
Fresh out the dealer, got the Tec for the squealers
Wear a vest for the killers, nuttin less cause it's reala
in the Big Apple, where it's quick to get your shit tackled
Enemies spit at you, best friends kidnap you
Trust no one (eh eh) got beef bust yo' gun
You don't need no one (nope) talkin bout that you owe him
I'ma go for dolo - Scarface without Manolo
One deep, I be solo, bustin heat, throwin bolos, it's hard

Chorus 1 + 2 overlap
