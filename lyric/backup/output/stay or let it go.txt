What's up girl? I need to talk to you for a minute
I can't keep playin' myself like this
There's only one thing I wanna know
Should I stay or should I go?

It's not my fault that you made yourself a regretful past
But all I know is, it makes me look bad
When I'm holdin' your hand and you see old friends you knew
And they walk away laughin', callin' me a fool

Now baby, I can't change the things you did before we met
Even though I didn't know you
But it's hard for me to trust you even though girl, I love you
So tell me what am I to do? yeah

Don't know if we would last
And if we do last can I erase the past?
Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

Don't know if we're meant to be
