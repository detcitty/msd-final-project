I was hanging with some friends of mine
We were all having a real good time, yeah
I saw a girl who was so very fine
I started waving my hands, my arms, my head

Got the nerve; found the words to say
But to my surprise she was passing
I mean it was strange 'cause she just walked away
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

Now you're nervous with the fever
Body beat and never quit
I'm in heaven when I see her
Won't you talk some little things?
Hope she talk to me
