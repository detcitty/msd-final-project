I'm as real as they come, I follow the rules
I'm still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don't f-ck around
I just felt they needed me, so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my god son just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I'm pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it aint right, I don't sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane, aint no salary cap in the dope game
Aint no collective bargaining on cocaine
So in other words nigga, do your thing
