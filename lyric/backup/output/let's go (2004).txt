Yeah, there's a lot of fuck niggaz in the club tonight
(Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em)
But it's gonna be aight
'Cause me and my click we don't give a fuck nigga
Trick Daddy, Jim Johnson, Big D, Lil' Jon

Let's go, let's go
If you want it you can get it let me know
(Let me know)
I'm 'bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's go, let's go
If you want it you can get it let me know
(Let me know)
I'm 'bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's go

If you want some, come get some
'Cause where I'm from we tote big guns
And everybody know somebody that
Know somebody that know somethin' bout it
And I want answers now
Who, what, where, when and why?
See, a lot of dudes like to act a fool
And all get all loud but that ain't my style

Now, he who he gonna get and what he gonna do
Run up on me if he want to
Out there impressin' his homies
But he stood up in front of his momma
I mop up the flo' with him
And I kick in the door and let the fo-fo get him
I got fools that'll go get him
This for him, his crew and the dudes that run with him
