Oh, I need somebody, somebody, yeah

It's so hard to find someone special
That someone you can love and trust
It's so hard to put your love on the line
You know love for sure is space and time

Some people all they want is fortune
Some people all they want is fame
Some people all they'll do is break your heart
There's got to be a, a better way of giving your love

I, I'm givin' ya love for love
If you feel it in your heart
That's the only way to start
It's gotta be love for love, hey
