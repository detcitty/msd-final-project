Back beat boogie got a hold on me
Make me wanna jump and shout
Twisting like a top
I never want to stop tonight

You surely look like a magazine
And you can move like I've never seen
Reeling and a-rocking, babe
Come on and dance with me

I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I've been a-boogieing since I ditched the stroller
So come on hold me tight
And we can rock the night away

I'm a rocker, I'm a roller
I've been a-boogieing since I ditched the stroller
So come on hold me tight
And we can rock the night away

Tight booted teenie with the smiling face
