Too late
Am I too late?
Too late
Am I too late?

Pain is my best friend
Makin' me think of you again
Wakin' me up and sayin'
"Fool, you've been careless and blind, unkind"

Tears I made you shed
(Look who's cryin')
Me, I made this bad
(No denyin')
I'm the man whose jones
Can't be brought into line

Am I too late to get in your door?
Am I too late? Have you locked the store?
Am I too late to sweep up the floor?
