In the early rush of morning
Trying to get the kids to school
One's hanging on my shirttail
Another's locked up in her room
And I'm yelling up the stairs
Stop worrying about your hair
You look fine

Then they're fighting in the backseat
And I'm playing referee
Now someone's gotta go
The moment that we leave
And everybody's late
I swear that I can't wait
Till they grow up

Then they do
And that's how it is
