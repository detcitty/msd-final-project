My father is a doctor he's a family man
my mother works for charity whenever she can
and they're both good clean americans who abide by the law
and they both stick up for liberty and they both support the war
my happiness was paid for when they laid their money down
for summers in a summer camp and winters in the town
my future in the system was talked about and planned
