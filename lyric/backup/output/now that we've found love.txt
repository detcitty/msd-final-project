Make daddy shoot, make daddy shoot
Make daddy shoot, make daddy shoot
Make daddy shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot all over the place

I wanna see you dance, dance, dance

Come on, baby, say when the music's playin'
I want to see you dance, get up and dance
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

I said music, oh, ah, yeah, say stole into my soul, went on and on
