Can't help this feeling
Can't help this feeling
I can't believe it's open for discussion
We've said our goodbyes
I've been a fool not to see the repercussions
You've had in my life
I'm at the point of no return
I've finally crossed the line
Don't want to stop and watch the bridges burn
'Cause I can't stand to see you stay behind
