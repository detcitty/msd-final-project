I'm a good guy for a gal,
So won't you look my palm over?
I've got time for a chat,
So won't you tell me my future?

I'm gonna break down at fifty,
And I'm not quite a stallion.
I'm a good guy for a gal,
And I'm mentally slipping.

Oh yeah, oh yeah,
What's that ya' see?
Oh boy, find out what's up with me
Oh yeah, oh yeah,
What's that ya' see?
Tell me more of what's gonna be.
