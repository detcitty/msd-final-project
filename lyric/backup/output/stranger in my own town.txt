Dave Peverett - Riff Bros. Music - ASCAP

Who's that stranger walking out in the cold?
Standing on the corner with his Kodachrome roll?
He may be a psychopath, he's acting so strange,
Lying to himself, saying nothing has changed.
He stares across at a house on the block,
Trying to find the courage to go over and knock.
What will he say when they open the door?
"This was my home, but it ain't no more."
