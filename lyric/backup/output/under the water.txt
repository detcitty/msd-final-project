I get confused when I'm tired
But the last time I saw you
We were in a room
With sunshine in my eyes

And water on the floor
I watched you float away
Take me with you

A long time ago
We were walking around
We were fooling around
In the garden, in the garden

I saw you turn around
And still you turn around
My eyes are playing tricks on me
How I miss you

I could be your lover
Chained under the water
Under the water

I could be standing on a ladder
To make it easier
To make it easier

Your eyes are colored stone
