Momma moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again
Chorus:

Starting over again
Where should they begin
'Cause they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
