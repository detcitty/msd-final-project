I don't believe in superstars
Organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold
The certainty of growing old

That right is right and left is wrong
That north and south can't get along
That east is east and west is west
And being first is always best

But I believe in love
I believe in babies
I believe in Mom and Dad
And I believe in you
