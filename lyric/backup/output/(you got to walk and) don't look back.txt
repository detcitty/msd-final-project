If it's love that you're running from
There is no hiding place
Just your problems, no one else's problems
You just have to face

If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

Now if your first lover let you down
There's something that can be done
