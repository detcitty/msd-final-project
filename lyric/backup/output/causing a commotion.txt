I've got the moves baby, you've got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you've got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

You met your match when you met me
I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy

The love you save may be your own
Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you

I've got the moves baby, you've got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you've got the motion
