Here we are
Out here, me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do

Here we stand
Trying not to fall
There's no need to worry
Love will conquer all

Do you really want to know
Just how long will last
Will all of the bad times pass?
How can we make things right?

Ooh and why
Why is the world so unkind?
We surely can find peace of mind
