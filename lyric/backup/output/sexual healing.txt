Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Oh, baby now let's get down tonight

Ooh baby, I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

And when I get that feelin'
I want sexual healin'
Sexual healin', oh baby
Makes me feel so fine

Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healin' baby, is good for me
Sexual healin' is something that's good for me
