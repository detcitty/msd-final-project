Captured my attention, make my heart stop & listen
When you look my way
Blue jeans and a ball cap, thinking that you're all that
And I'm thinking the same

You got that something in your eyes
I think about it all the time
If you ever wonder, if I wanna make you mine

Yeah boy, I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah boy, I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight

Yeah boy, you shine & you can't even help it
Yeah boy, your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know, if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah boy

Every song that's playing got me thinking about you baby
