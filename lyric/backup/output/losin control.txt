She's fallin' in love now
Losin' control now
Fightin' the truth
Tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright girl
Yeah, I think it's alright girl
She's fallin' in love now
Losin' control now
Fightin' the truth
Tryin' to hide
But I think it's alright girl
Yeah, I think it's alright girl
She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored he's on his own time
