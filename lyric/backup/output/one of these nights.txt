One of these nights
One of these crazy old nights
We're gonna find out pretty mama
What turns on your lights
The full moon is calling
The fever is high
And the wicked wind whispers and moans
You got your demons you got desires
Well I got a few of my own
Ooh... someone to be kind to in between the dark and the light
Ooh... coming right behind you swear I'm gonna find you
One of these nights
One of these dreams
