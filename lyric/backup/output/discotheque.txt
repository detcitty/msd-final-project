You can reach, but you can't grab it.
You can't hold it, control it
You can't bag it.

You can push, but you can't direct it
Circulate, regulate, oh no
You cannot connect it - love.

You know you're chewing bubble gum
You know what that is but you still want some.
You just can't get enough of that lovey-dovey stuff
