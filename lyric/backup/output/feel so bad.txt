You know I feel so bad, children
Feel like a ballgame on a rainy day
Yes, I do, y'all

Don't you know I feel so bad, children
Oh, Lord, like a ballgame on a rainy day

Whoa, since I lost my woman
You see I have to shake my head
And then I walk away
I have to walk away

Y'all listen to this

I just wanna tell you people
I wanna tell you just how I feel
