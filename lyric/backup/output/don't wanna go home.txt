Jason Derulo
Check that out, what they playin'
That's my song, that's my song
Where my drinks
I've been waiting much too long, much too long
And this girl on my lap passing out, she's a blonde
The last thing on my mind is going home

From the window to the wall
This club is jumping, til tomorrow
Is it daylight or is it nightime?
1 o'clock 2 o'clock 3 o'clock 4
We gon' tear the club up, up, up, up, up, up, up

Ayo me say day oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
Yeah so we losing control
Turn the lights low cause we about to get blown
