Mustard on the beat, ho!

Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fucking like no other
Don't you tell ‘em what we do
Don't tell ‘em
Don't tell ‘em
You don't even
Don't tell ‘em
You don't even
You don't even gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell ‘em
Don't you tell ‘em
You and me
Don't you tell ‘em
Don't you tell ‘em
You and me
Don't you tell ‘em
Don't you tell ‘em

Know you say you down wit it
Won't tell em how you hit the ground wit it
Girl you know I'm from Chicago, I act a fool, bobby brown wit it (in it)
Nobody take me out tho
You got gifts bring em down the south pole
Marathon doll gon' puttin' miles
Don't you worry bout it might gon' work it out
Only is you got me feeling like this oohh why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right

Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fucking like no other
Don't you tell ‘em what we do
