I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work

Used to be sleeping on itchy beds
Bed bugs in the motel, now your bitch give me head
Twenty bitches in the hotel on a ramen noodle diet
Tour life wasn't so well
All my niggas starting riots, moshpitting on your tours now
Uncle T doing so well, first class from a old jail
T Ferg did fifteen in the feds, getting no mail
My daddy died and my cousin too
They didn't let them out of no cell
Provide jobs for my whole block, I cannot slow down
Nigga, I won't stop now, mothafucka this is my town
Take the block, make it hot now, 143rd with the drop down
Icy chain with the watch now, third piece full of rocks now
Niggas squint when they watch now, leveling up to the top now

I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
