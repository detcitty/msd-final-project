There's nothing I could say to you
Nothing I could ever do to make you see
What you mean to me
All the pain the tears I cried
Still you never said goodbye
And now I know
How far you'd go

I know I let you down
But it's not like that now
This time I'll never
Let you go

I will be
All that you want
And get myself together
â€˜Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life
I'll be with you forever
To get you through the day
