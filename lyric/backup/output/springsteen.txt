To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut off jeans
Somwhere between that setting sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
Well, we're just getting started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and sang Oh-h-h-h-h-h
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
Took the long way to your house
I canstill hear the sound of you saying don't go
When I think about you, I think about 17
