Down to my last match fire I touch just to feel
Why is it easier to burn than it is to heal?

Out in the cold you've been
I begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again

I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't
