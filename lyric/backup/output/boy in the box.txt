When I go out
I can see the world from inside
Without a doubt
I can shake my head and scream and shout
(Because) I can't take it no more
I can't stand it no more

Who's laughin' at me?

Through the night
Was the giant sleeping?
The endless flight
O the mystery's for keeping
(Because) I can't take it no more
I can't stand it no more
