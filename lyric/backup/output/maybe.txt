SPOKEN:
You know Girls it's hard to find a guy that really blows your mind
And you just dig everything about him
And when you mess up your good thing you feel like you wanna die
I know because I messed up mine
You know girls sometimes we can say some pretty dumb things
I told the nicest guy in the word to get lost I don't need you
But he was cool, he just stood there looking so hurt
