Usher, Lil' Jon, Ludacris
Yeah, man, once again, it's on
(It's on)
You know we had to do it again, right?

We had to do it again, boy
Want you to sing to these ladies, man
Alight, so I'm up first? Alight, lemme have it
Let's do it

Baby, how ya doin'?
Hope that 'cha fine, wanna know what you got in mind
And I'm, got me fiendin' like Jodeci, girl, I can't leave you alone
Take a shot of this here, Petrone' and it's gon' be on

V.I.P. done got way too crowded
I'm about to end up callin' it a night
You should holla at 'cha girl, tell her you shake it and seized
Pull off, beep-beep, shotgun in the GT with me

She said, "Ohh, ohh, I'm ready to ride, yeah
'Cause once you get inside, you can't change your mind
Don't mean to sound impatient
But you gotta promise, baby, ohh‚Äù

Tell me again
(Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Ohh, I gotta know, baby, oh, yeah)

Tell me again
(Make sho' you right, ohh, before we leave)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Ohh, it's a good look, baby)

Sometime wanna be your lover
