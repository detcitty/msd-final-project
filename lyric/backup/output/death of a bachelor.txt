Do I look lonely?
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me
I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight
I'm playing hooky
With the best of the best, pull my heart out my chest
So that you can see it too

I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tangles my neck
How do I live?
