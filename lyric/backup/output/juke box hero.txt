Standing in the rain with his head hung low
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream

He heard one guitar, just blew him away
Saw stars in his eyes and the very next day

Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it but he knew for sure

That one guitar felt good in his hands
Didn't take long to understand
