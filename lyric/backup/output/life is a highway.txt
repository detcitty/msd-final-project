Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend sometimes you stand Sometimes you turn your back to the wind There's a world outside every darkened door Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way I want to drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
