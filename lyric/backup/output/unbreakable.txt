This song here
Something brand new for y'all
Ha-ha-ha
Uh-uh
It's called unbreakable
Now I want y'all to listen
Ha-ha-ha
Uh-uh-uh
Clap got your hands everybody, uh
Clap your hands
Come on keep it going
Clap your hands everybody
Clap your hands everybody, uh
Clap
Lets do it
You ready?
Come on

We could fight like Ike and Tina
Or give back like Bill and Camille
Be rich like Oprah and Steadman
Or instead struggle like Flo and James Evans
'Cause he ain't no different from you
And she ain't no different from me
So
We got to live out our dreams
Like the people on TV

We gotta stay tuned
There's more to see
(unbreakable)
Through the technical difficulties, uh (unbreakable)
We might have to take a break
But y'all know we'll be back next week
I'm singing
