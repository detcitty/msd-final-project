Bop Gun
(Endangered Species)
Hmm, yeah
Ooh, yeah

On guard, defend yourself
Movin' right on you, baby
On guard, defend yourself
Down to get down
(Down)
Baby

Turn me loose, we shall overcome
Where did you get that funk from, huh?
Turn me on, they're spoiling the fun
Let's shoot them with the bop gun

On guard, defend yourself
Movin' right around
(Hey baby)
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump

On guard, defend yourself
Bound to get down, baby
(Hey)
Turn me loose
Let me shoot them with the bop gun

Endangered species
Endangered species
Endangered species
Let me shoot them with the bop gun

Endangered species
Endangered species
Endangered species
Endangered species

We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump
We got to get over the hump

When the syndrome is around
(On guard)
Don't let your guard down
All you've got to do is
Call on the funk, oh

On guard, defend yourself
We shall overcome
Where did you get that funk from?
They're spoiling the fun
Shoot them with the bop gun

Oh, hey baby
On guard, protect yourself
Movin' in on you, baby
I don't think you hear me
