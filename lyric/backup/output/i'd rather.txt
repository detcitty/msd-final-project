I thought some time alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that

I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I love at home to be alone, alone

And I tried and found out this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you
Than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm
Than safe and warm by myself

I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
