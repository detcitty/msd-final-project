Wake up to the blue sky
Grab your shades
And let's go for a ride
Breakfast by the ocean
We'll do lunch at Sunset & Vine

Every day's a dreaming California
Every night the stars come out to play
Wish that I could always feel this way

There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
Out of this world for the first time, baby
Oh, it's alright
