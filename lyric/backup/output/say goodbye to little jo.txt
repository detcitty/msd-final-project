Just say goodbye to little Jo
Just turn her loose now let her go
And she'll be leaving while the sun goes down
She doesn't love ya anymore

Sometimes it's worth it to talk
Some wounds are easy to heal
Sometimes it's all in your mind
Uh, but this time it's big and it's real

Gold turning back into night
This time you can't make her stay
Don't try to block her in pain
Or don't try to stand in her way
