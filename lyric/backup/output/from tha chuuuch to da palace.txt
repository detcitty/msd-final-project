(feat. Pharrell)

[Intro]
Fa shizzle dizzle, it's the big Neptizzle
with the Snoopy D-O-Double Gizzle!

... (Snoop Dogg!)
C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg!)
Hehe, yeah, C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg!)
A-ha-ha! C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg!)

[Verse One: Snoop Dogg]
Bam! Boom! Whatchu gon' do cuz?
Guess who rollin in, with them baby blue Chucks?
And I've still got my khakis creased
I'm still loc'n on these beats and keep a bad bitch on the streets
It's the S-N-double-O-P'n
Biggest dogg of 'em all, and youse a flea'n
And since I got time to drop it for you I guess I must
And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust
I keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust
And can't none of y'all fuck with us
But you can run up on the G but that's not thinkin wisely
These thrillers are +Contagious+, just like Ron Isley
{"What the hell is goin on? Someone's sleepin in my home"}
Snoop to the D-O-Double G (uh-huh)
Get in where you fit in, follow me (ooh!)
