Verse 1

Dear love I was thinking how I should be starting this
mean difference of ways still I can light you like an arsonist
put my heart in this particularly funny when we start to kiss, marvelous
How I see you in the cut chillin' with your homies gettin' fucked up
I got fantasies of you carrying me home
I hope you stayin'alone I'm into givin'pleasure echoin' rhythms of my
manly moans
Don't be playin' me wrong I'm too grown for games,
mental manipulation ain't the occupation for the playa you facin I'm
strong
cuz you see I don't be really quite comin on the same boldly and bodily
fluids with every word that 'curs
Girl you deserve some herb and company to be with, fuck whoever you
were gonna leave with
I'm the one you should see shit, I found some love like Adam and Eve
shit
who you should be with your body I squeeze quick
Stick through the sheets are your arms and see don't be alarmed if I
make you feel good all over
cuz I be droppin the bomb that's cuz I'm in the beyond even though
niggaz in the hood is all soldiers
You still gonna suffer the consequences defenseless thinkin about
becomin my wife
if I rock you tonight you be the love of my life
cuz I be huggin you like I'm huggin the mike, plus I'm the one thats
rubbin' you right
And able to stick my tongue up in your navel and lick till you drop
even though I like to stick the twat
I'm realizin' theres a variation of ways I can get you hot
I'm in to learnin' you so pick the spot, I'll get pleasure too but let
me hush and let the lust get a check
I know you don't want me to hit it yet, but don't act like its a crime
cuz it hasn't been committed yet,
but baby won't you let me get it what? get it wet
