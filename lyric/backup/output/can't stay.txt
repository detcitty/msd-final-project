Girl, I gotta go, I can't stay
You said things would change
But girl, things are still the same
Girl, I gotta go, I can't stay

We stay together putting the front on
I'd rather be on my own
When we first met things were fine
We went out to dine

We strolled the beach
Holding hands sharing quality time
What happened between then and now
The love we shared was lost somehow

My friends tried to tell me
That we're moving too fast
But how could I know the feelings would pass
It wouldn't last

I know I should have left a long time ago
But I stayed to see
Still hoping and praying you still love me

Girl, I gotta go, I can't stay
You said things would change
But girl, things are still the same
Girl, I gotta go, I can't stay
