I can't blame you
Nobody wants to be the fool
Face the music
It's all there in front of you
You can get it if you really try
You can get it if you don't ask why

Look at you
The life you've gotten used to
You don't care about 
The things you're into
You can get it
â€˜Cause it's everywhere
Temptation hides 
Behind every stare
And when you get it
It makes you feel good
You don't regret it
But maybe you should
