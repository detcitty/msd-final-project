Yeah
Every hood's the same
Every hood's the same
Come on

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed
It's the same ole same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day to day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower living?
The projects, thank god for Russell Simmons
Thank god for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grille
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggaz taken over showbiz
