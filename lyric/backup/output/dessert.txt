They can imitate you
But they can't duplicate you
Cause you got something special
That makes me wanna taste you
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's wrong
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's wrong

They can imitate you

Whatcha gon

Murder that, murder that
Dancefloor, dancefloor

Murder that
