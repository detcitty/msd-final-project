Oh oh, yeah
Oh oh, yeah
Oh oh, yeah
Oh oh

Every girl, every boy
They got your posters on their wall, yeah
Photographs, autographs
The minute you step out the door you will meet the applause

Paparazzi's hiding in the bushes trying to make a dollar
Wanna be you
When they see you, they scream out loud

Starstruck, camera flashes, cover of magazines
Starstruck, designer sunglasses, living the dream as a teen
Driving fancy cars, Hollywood Boulevard
