I worked all week to make me some money
Bring it back to mama bet she'd give me some honey, yeah
Cashed my check got a pocket of dollars
Loosenin' the buttons on my blue-collar, yeah

Ooh, this is what I do, this is where I stand
This is who I am

Livin' the song of a ramblin' man
Gettin' it done with my own two hands
Puttin' some green in a coffee can
For when I'm gone, when I'm gone

Trickin' my truck like a Cadillac
