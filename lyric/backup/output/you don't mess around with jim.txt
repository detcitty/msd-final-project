Uptown's got its hustlers
the bowry's got its bums
forty-second street's got big jim walker
he's a pool-shootin' son of a gun
well he's big and dumb as a man can come
but he's stronger than a country hoss
and when the bad folks all get together at night
you know they all call big jim "boss"
(just because ...)
