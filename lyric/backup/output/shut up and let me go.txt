Shut up and let me go
This hurts, I tell you so
For the last time you will kiss my lips
Now shut up and let me go
Your jeans were once so clean
I bet you changed your wardrobe since we met
Now oh so easily you're over me
Gone is love
It's you that ought to be holding me
I'm not containable
This time love is not sustainable
I ain't freakin'
I ain't fakin' this
