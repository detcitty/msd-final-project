I got something for the fellas this time around
Lady's, won't you tell me your names
Tabath, Avina and Lavan

If you really, really want it
All you got to do is get up on it
If you really, really want it
All you got to do is get up on it

The time has come for us, ooh baby
To get real busy baby, oh yes, it has, umm
And you don't have to be afraid of our love, oh no
'Cause it won't hurt you sugar
