Yeah baby
Ah, come on

Baby, it was uncool to love me
Then leave me standing here now
Without a goodbye
And maybe I am the fool you call me
'Cause I'll be here standing waiting
To hear you say to me

I'm ready
(You know I'm ready)
To love you
(To love you)
Forever
(Forever)
Hey love, now
Come love me forever more

I'm ready
(You know I'm ready)
To love you
(To love you)
Forever
(Forever)
Hey love, now
Come love me forever more

Sometimes, when I'm alone I feel sad
I know you'll leave me once again
And take my pride
