She's about to earn some bragging rights
I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you wanna do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hard and my cup cold
My tongue slurred cause I'm so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
And I'mma be your memory
Sing it in my ears, so I can hear what you're saying to me
I got cups full of that Rose
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I'mma have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I'mma have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
