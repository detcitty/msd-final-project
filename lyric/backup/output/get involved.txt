Met this girl walking [Incomprehensible]
Looking good but looking down
Said she needed inspiration
What I said, y'all?
I said, "Get yo shit 'cause we're goin' uptown"

I could tell she was feelin' better
When she got inside the car
What was she?
She was a dark skinned girl with pretty corn rows
She was doin' her best to try to hide her scars

I don't really care
About that there, just get involved
