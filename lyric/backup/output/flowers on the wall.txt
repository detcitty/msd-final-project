I keep hearin' your concern about my happiness
but all that thought you've given me is, conscience i guess
if i were walkin' in your shoes, i wouldn't worry none
while you and your friends are worryin''bout me, i'm havin'lots of fun
--chorus
countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
