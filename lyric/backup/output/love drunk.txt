Top down in the summer sun
The day we met was like a hit-and-run
And I still taste it on my tongue

The sky was burning up like fireworks
You made me want you oh so bad it hurt
But girl, in case you haven't heard

I used to be love drunk but now I'm hung-over
I'll love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying, say hello to goodbye
