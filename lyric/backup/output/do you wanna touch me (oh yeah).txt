We've been here too long tryin' to get along
Pretendin' that you're oh, so shy
I'm a natural ma'am doin' all I can
My temperature is runnin' high

Cry at night no one in sight
An' we got so much to share
Talking's fine if you got the time
But I ain't got the time to spare, yeah

Do you wanna touch?
(Yeah)
Do you wanna touch?
(Yeah)
Do you wanna touch me there, where?
