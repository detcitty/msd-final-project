It all came so easy
All the lovin' you gave me
The feelings we shared
And I still can remember
How your touch was so tender
It told me you cared

We had a once in a lifetime
But I just couldn't see
Until' it was gone
A second once in a lifetime
May be too much to ask
But I swear from now on

If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
