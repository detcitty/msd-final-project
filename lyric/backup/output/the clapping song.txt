Three-six-nine
The gosse drank wine.
The monkey chew tobacco on the street car line.
The line broke
The monkey got choked
And they all went to heaven in a little row boat.
Clap Pat - Clap Pat - Clap Pat - Clap Slap!
Clap Pat! Clap your hand

Pat it on your partners hand... Right hand.
Clap Pat! Clap your hand
Cross it with your left arm
