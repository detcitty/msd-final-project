My immaculate dream made of breath and skin
I've been waiting for you
Signed, with a home tattoo
"Happy birthday to you" was created for you

Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces

Ahh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime to come undone
Now we'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry

Who do you need?
Who do you love?
