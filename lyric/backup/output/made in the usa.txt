Our love runs deep like a Chevy,
If you fall I'll fall with you baby
'Cause that's the way we like to do it
That's the way we like

You run around open doors like a gentleman
And tell me, "Girl, every day you're my everything."
'Cause that's the way you like to do it
That's the way you like

Just a little West Coast, and a bit of sunshine
Hair blowing in the wind, losing track of time
Just you and I, just you and I
Whoa, whoa

No matter how far we go
