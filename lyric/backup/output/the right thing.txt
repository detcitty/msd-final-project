In the middle of the night
When the time is right
Sexily right
I'm gonna do the right thing
I'm gonna move it slow
Much harder though
Sexily slow
I'm gonna do the right thing

I'm feeling hot
I ain't never gonna stop
To get what you got
You better take what I bring
I feel it now
Much harder now
Oh more than any old how
Say you feel the pain

Feel I'm getting harder now
