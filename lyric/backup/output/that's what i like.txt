Come on everybody, everybody, everybody
C C Come on everybody

I'm gonna sing my song

It won't take long
We're gonna do the twist
We're gonna do the twist
We're gonna do the twist
And it goes like this
C'mon let's twist again like we did last summer
Yeah let's twist again like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'
Yeah let's twist again twistin' time is here

Hey, hey, hey, hey hey baby won't you take a chance
Say that you'll let me have this dance
Oh let's dance
Oh let's dance
Oh do the twist, the stomp, the mash potato too
Any old dance that you want to do
