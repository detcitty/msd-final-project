You don't know me but I'm your brother
I was raised here in this living hell
You don't know my kind in your world
Fairly soon the time will tell
You
Telling me the things you're gonna do for me
I ain't blind and I don't like what I think I see
(takin' it to the streets)
Takin' it to the streets
(takin' it to the streets)
No more need for running
(takin' it to the streets)
Oh, na, na
Take this message to my brother
You will find him everywhere
Wherever people live together
Tied in poverty's despair
Oh, you
Telling me the things you're gonna do for me
I ain't blind and I don't like what I think I see
(takin' it to the streets)
