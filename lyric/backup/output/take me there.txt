R-U-G-R-A-T-S

Take me there, I wanna go there
Take me there, let's go there
Take me to that great place
With wonders and wishes
Take me there, I wanna go there
Take me there, you know where
Just take me to that great place
With wonders and wishes

Sittin' here thinking about yesterday
About what we did and how we used to play
