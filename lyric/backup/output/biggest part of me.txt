(sunrise) There's a new sun arisin'

(in your eyes) I can see a new horizon

(realize) That will keep me realizin'
You're the biggest part of me

(stay the night) Need your lovin' here beside me
(shine the light) Need you close enough to guide me
(all my life) I've been hopin' you would find me
You're the biggest part of me

W-e-l-l...

Make a wish baby
Well and I will make it come true
Make a list baby
Of the things I'll do for you
Ain't no risk now
In lettin' my love rain down on you
So we could wash away the past
So that we may start anew...

(rainbow) Risin' over my shoulder
