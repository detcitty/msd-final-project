I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming, I'm coming
Boy there's so many things to give
I've been aware of your charms for so long
And there's nothing that you can do
To stop me from coming around
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming home, I'm coming home to your house
I'm coming home, I'm coming home to your house
