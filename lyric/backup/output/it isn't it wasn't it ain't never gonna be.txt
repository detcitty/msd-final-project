VERSE 1: Sung by Aretha

You've been hanging round my boyfriend
You've been sayin that he's sweet, yeah
Girl I know that you've been talking
Because the talk is on the street
You say that you are gonna steal his heart
Well sweety you ain't gonna get that far
You're after somethin that don't belong to you
Well girlfriend I've got news for you
(spoken): What are you trying to say Miss Thang?

It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never, ever, never, never, never gonna be your man

VERSE 2: Sung by Whitney

Well I just ain't the kind of woman
To pick the fruit off of your tree, girl
And you keep saying that he's your man
Well that ain't what he said to me
He blow me kissses as he drives away
He sends me roses in the middle of the day, yeah
You think it's you that he's thinking of
But I'm the one he really, really loves
(spoken): So what am I tring to say? Don't dis me girl!!

DOUBLE It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
