Well, everybody's heart needs a holiday, sometime
And everyone of us needs to get away, somehow
So I'm laughing lighthearted moods, oh, the sight-seeing afternoons
And tellin' a joke or two 'cause everyday invites you
To find your place in the sun

It's time to find your place in the sun
(Find your place, find your place in the sun)
It's time to find your place in the sun
