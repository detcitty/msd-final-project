On waves of love my heart is breaking
And stranger still my self control I can't rely on anymore
New tide, surprise, my world is changing
Within this frame an ocean swell behind the smile, I know it well

Beneath a lover's moon I'm waiting
I am the pilot of the storma, adrift in pleasure I may drown
I built this ship it is my making
