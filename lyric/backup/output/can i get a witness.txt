Ah ah listen everybody (body), specially you girls (girls)
Is it right to be left alone when the one you love is never home
I love too hard my friends sometimes say
But I believe I believe that a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside to see you treat me so unkind
Somebody somewhere tell her it ain't fair

Can I get a witness (Can I get a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
I want a witness (Can I get a witness)
Somebody (Can I get a witness)

Is it right to be treated so bad when you give her everything you had
