Let's go 
Hov 
Uh huh, Hov' 
You, are, not, ready 
Hov', unstoppable, Dynasty, young Hova 

I'm a hustler baby (I'm a hustler) 
I just want you to know (Wanna let you know) 
It aint where I been (It aint where I been) 
But where I'm bout to go (Top of the world) 
Now I just wanna love you (Just wanna love you) 
But be who I am (you know you love me) 
And with all this cash (mo' money, mo' problems]) 
You'll forget your man 
Now give it to me 
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff 
But don't bullsh*t me 
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi stuff 

When the Remi's in the system 
Aint no tellin will I fuck 'em will I diss 'em 
That's what they be yellin 
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation 
Y'all be chasin, I replace them 
Huh, drunk of Crist', mommy on E 
Can't keep her little model hands off me 
Both in the club, high, singing off key 

And I wish I never met her at all 
It gets better, ordered another round
