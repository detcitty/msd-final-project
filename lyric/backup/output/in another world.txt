Thumb stuck high in the air
Destination anywhere
This road decides to go
Underneath the desert sky
I find a place to hide and rest my weary bones
This underpass will shade the heat
As my mind drifts off to sleep...

There you are with your hair all down
And your feet are bare and your cotton gown
What a beautiful sight
In the moonlight
The way you're looking at me with your loving eyes
