Never believed in love at first sight
But I believe what i'm feeling tonight
Cause when I saw you across the room
I felt my heart going boom boom boom
I looked, I fell so hard
Girl I know you can tell that
I'm hooked on you, oh girl
You know i'm falling for you because

I looked, I fell so hard
Girl I know you can tell that
I'm hooked on you, oh girl
You know I'm falling for you because
