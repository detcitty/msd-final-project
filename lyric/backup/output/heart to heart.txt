You ain't crazy
I ain't gonna lie anymore
What you're feelin'
There's a reason for
I wanna do right
Oh, gotta do right

Do I love you, oh
You know I've tried
But what you're after
You can't find in my eyes
I'm gonna do right

Darlin'
Tell the truth
Don't turn away
This is our last chance
To touch each other's heart

Does anything last forever
I don't know
Maybe we're near the end
(So darlin' tell me)
So darlin', oh
How can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart, oh no
Well, the only way to start
