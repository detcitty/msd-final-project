Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

This how we do it, where I'm from
I'm thuggin' in the club, until I see the sun
Shine, on my face, got the gun on my waist
Walkin' to my Escalade, tell them niggas I'm not afraid
To let the nine, sing out, it can ring out

This how we do it, where I'm from
I'm thuggin' in the club, until I see the sun
Shine, on my face, got the gun on my waist
Walkin' to my Escalade, tell them niggas I'm not afraid
To let the nine, sing out, it can ring out

Got one more minute, hold last call
Two drunk players leaning on the wall
Three crazy niggas screamin', "Alcohol"
Four more niggas claimin' that they ball

Five bartenders and they all want leave
Six ugly bitches with some fucked up weaves
Seven dyked broads and they all look rough
Eight niggas hollerin', "Don't fuck wit us"

Nine bitches runnin' off at the mouth
Ten bitches trying to hear what they talkin' about
Eleven cute shorties in the whole damn club
Twelve wannabe, gonna be, nothin' but scrubs

Thirteen fights, niggas, bitches and dykes
Fourteen police reading niggas they rights
