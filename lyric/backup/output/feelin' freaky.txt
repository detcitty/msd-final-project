Yo,
put the kids to bed
yo shawty,
i know you ain't scurred
B2k,
and nick cannon,
track masters,
the pied piper
Yo, the freaks come out at night
i'm like houdini with the magic stick
when you turn out the light shawty grippin' my stomach tighter
when i burn out on the bike
holla at the young thugs
what we doing tonight
i'm in the oj throwback jersey
dressed to kill
bridget won't get it but vanessa will
vanessa's real
shorty's got sex appeal
you can hear this beat banging from the excess field
pied piper, we need somin' for these chicks to dance to
look mami, i'm tryna grind
i'm ain't tryna romance you
i'm just tryna get them pants loose
let's get private
2-way me
text me
t-mobile sidekick
on the one let's talk and neglect the gossip
i'm as real as they come baby girl, i got this
my wrist all numb
you can watch the watch gliss
we already bubbly
we ain't gotta pop chrys
I'll come through, my style is balibu
tease and nike shoes
plus chicks by the twos (uh huh)
