Sometimes I feel like I'm getting kinda low
Thoughts that I'm thinkin' are the reason
So I try to remember without talkin' to myself
Things that I said or maybe things that I felt about you

Sittin' in a corner of a crowded bar room
People all around me and I still feel alone
Just when I know I'm gonna break down and cry
