Oh why, oh why, oh why you tell me l-l-lies
Never t-t-think that I would rea-li-li-lize
Things you say-ay-ay I will make you fay-ay-ay-ade away
B-b-bye, b-b-bye, bye, bye, goodbye

12 o'clock last night in a club
You an' a girl do de rub-a-dub-dub
Short dress and long curly hair
Don't deny it 'cause I saw you there

Step 1, me did dede when you give her the line
Step 2, me did dede when you looked so sincere
Step 3, me did dede when you hold her close and
Tell her everything dat she won't fear

Why you play those games those g-g-games with me, oh, no, no, no
