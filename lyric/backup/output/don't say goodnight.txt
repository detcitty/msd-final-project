I wanna love you, yeah, yeah
Over and over again
I wanna see, see what your life, life can be
(Over and over)

Hey, hey, baby
Don? t say goodnight when you know
It's time for love
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Don't say goodnight, oh, when you know
I gotta have your love

I wanna feel you
I wanna thrill you, girl
I want to caress you
Ooh, never let you go
