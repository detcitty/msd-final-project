Catch me
Catch me, I'm falling in love for the first time
For you I drop the tough guy shit
On this bus I sit

Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special to somebody in a world where they not lovin' me

Handcuffs keep huggin the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
