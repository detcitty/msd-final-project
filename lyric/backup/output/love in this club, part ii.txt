Yea (yea, yea)
Styles I hear you man
(Usher)
This it right here
Queen Bee, yea
I'm the King, ya'll know that
She the queen, came right back
Yea, Yea
Oh! Remix!

Now baby girl there ain't no more
That I can say
You know by now I want it more than anything
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody

I know you want it
But I'm hesitating
You must be crazy
I got a man
And you got a lady

I know we here together
So this must be something special
You can be anywhere you wanted

But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence it was meant to be
Don't be shy, gon' let yo boy get in
So you can tell all yo friends you was on the remix like
