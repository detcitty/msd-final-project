Wally's getting' anxious thinkin' 'bout tonight
Bruce is all spiffy lookin' wicked lookin' right
Eddie's getting' spruced
And Donna's getting' loose
They're passin' round the bottle
And they're gettin' good and juiced
B.G.'s winin' dinin' checkin' talent at the club
Skippers hauntin' second lookin' forward to his rub
The busters from the country
And the hitters from the shop
Everybody wants to do the Horizontal Bop

Someone bring the records
