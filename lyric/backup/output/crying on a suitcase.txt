Boy, don't wait, don't think
Don't lock the door behind you
Run and jump into your truck
And hit the gas, burn some rubber up
Yeah, your time's running out, do it now

Take a shortcut, take a back road
Take the shoulder to the exit
Skip the parking, screw the ticket
Hit the curb and leave it sitting
Whatever it takes, you gotta get to that gate

She's crying on a suitcase
Sitting at the airport, waiting on the airplane
'Bout to take her out of here
Ooh
