Ricky was a young boy, he had a heart of stone
Lived 9 to 5 and he worked his fingers to the bone
Just barely out of school, he
came from the edge of town
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down, oh no
He had no money, no, no good at home
He walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
And now it's 18 and life, you got it

18 and life, you know
