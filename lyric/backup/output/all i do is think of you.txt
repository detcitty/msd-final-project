Ooooooooooooh... heeeeyyy...
i can't wait to get to school each day
and wait for you to pass my way
and bells start to ring
and angels start to sing:
"hey that's the girl for you
so what are ya gonna do?"
hey little girl!
I LOVE YOU! (i love you so...)
All i do is think of you
day and night (day and night that's all i do)
i can't get you off my mind
thinking back (all the time)
all the time
