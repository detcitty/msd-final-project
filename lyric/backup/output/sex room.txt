Welcome to my sex room
Welcome to my sex room

Welcome to my little sanctuary
You've been lookin' so good all day
And you really got a nigga
Pretty anxious, baby
Better call your boss
Tell him that your daddy's home
Take a couple days off and take it off and
Leave nothing but your T-shirts and your panties on
Feelin' high but I'm hung real low
Lookin' sorta like a tripod
So power down your cell phone
And power up your iPod
Power down your inhibitions
And power up your inner freak
(Yes, yes, fuck)
It's the only words that you finna speak
It's about to get real x-rated
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?
But enough about me, let me think
Should I be worryin' about if I can handle you
Damn right, I'mma get that thang
And I'mma put my name on it
All night I'mma whip that thang
All state better put a claim on it
I claim my territory
My tongue finna mark you up
You could be my fire cracker
My tongue finna spark you up
Get ready for blast off
Waterfall's gon' splash off
You might lose around 4 or 5 pounds
So get ready to sweat your ass off
Welcome to my sex room

Where your body meets my body
It's our private after party
If you want it, girl, I got it
In my sex room

Candles and a pole
Sets your body to your soul
From the bed down to the floor
Sex room
