Everybody getting high
Getting high, getting high, getting high

I just took some molly, what else?
Got some bitch from Follies with us
She gonna fuck the squad, what else?
I'mma fuck her broads, what else?
Bitch from Pakistan, what up?
Ferraris and them Lambs, what else?
'Bout to fuck this club up, what else?

(Get, get, get)

I turn the Ritz into a pour house
It's like eviction number four now
Go 'head and ash it on the floor now
Girl go ahead and show me how you go down
And I feel my whole body peaking
And I'm fucking anybody with they legs wide
Getting faded with some bitches from the West Side
East coast, nigga repping North Side
Never waste a hoe's time (Freebands)
Bitch, I'm on my own time
Fuck a nigga co-sign
Always change my number and my phone line
Baby girl, I don't lie
Used to have no money for a crib
Now my room service bill cost your whole life
If they try to stunt me, I go all out military

I'm camo'ed all out, like I'm in the military
I free up all my niggas, locked up in the penitentiary

Cause I'm always repping for that low life
Repping for that low life (turn up)
Low life, low life, low life
Know I'm repping for that low, low life
(Representing, I'm representing, representing)
Said I'm repping for that low life
Low life, low life, low life, low life
