I'm booking myself a one way flight

I gotta see the color in your eyes
Yeah, telling myself I'm gonna be alright
Without you baby it's a waste of time
Yeah, our first date girl the seasons changed.
It got washed away in a summer rain
You can't undo a fall like this
'Cause love don't know what distance is
Yeah, I know that's crazy
But I don't want good and I don't want good enough
I want can't sleep, can't breathe without your love
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy
