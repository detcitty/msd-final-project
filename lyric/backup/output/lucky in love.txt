A betting fool, a gambling man
No sooner up you're down again
Mama said you won't get hurt
Don't play the cards, you won't get burned

But there's a place where I still win
But there's no money in this thing
The game of hearts puts me in spades
The only game I got it made

Oh, I'm lucky in love
Yes, I've got the winning touch
Lucky in love
Suddenly, I'm dangerous

I'm betting on a filly down at the track
A natural-born winner, that's a fact
A hundred yards from the winning post (c'mon, c'mon)
The horse fell down, musta seen a ghost

But there's a place where I still win
That is still my sure-fire thing
