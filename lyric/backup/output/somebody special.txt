How can you say life is getting Lou down?
Get yourself out
go along with the crowd.
You're all dressed up
got nowhere to go

You feel left out 'cos nobody showed. - Listen
Babe:
And when you think you're the only one
Who can't find love in this world

Tell yourself there's another one

Who's waiting for you - somewhere.

Somebody special is thinking of you
