This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die I'mma fuckin ball
Now who gon stop me?
Who gon stop me huh?
Who gon stop me?
Who gon stop me huh?

Black cards, black cars, Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for?
Who gon stop me huh?

Who gon stop me huh?

Who gon stop me?

No brakes, I need, State Farm
So many watches I need 8 arms
One neck but got 8 charms
Who gon stop me huh?

Niggaas talkin, they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay

That's pig latin, itch-bay
Who gon stop me huh?
Last night ain't go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator, If you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, You just supposed to say none
