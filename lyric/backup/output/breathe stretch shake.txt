Uh
This is what I sound like after 5 years
(You back kid)
(You back kid, Bad Boy for real, Let's go)

Before 99 I was born again
5 years later and I'm on again
Man I think I'm born to win
Mase broke, that's a oxy moron
Forget a bus, I bought a drop to tour on
G-4's What I soar on, uh
You thinkin I ain't hot you so wrong
Sorry for the prolong
But now life goes on
Long list of hits and it goes on
I wake up, and I don't even feel like a star
And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gone make me cry
It's kinda eerie when you hear me
Ya hairs stand up
Been a change of plan
Rip your old plan up
Instead of hatin
Help me lift the big man up (As we proceed... come on... yeah)

Awake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
