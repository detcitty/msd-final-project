Hey, yo I don't even know you and I hate you
See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
How would you feel if she held you down and raped you?
Tried and tried, but she never could escape you

She was in love and I'd ask her how? I mean why?
What kind of love from a nigga would black your eye?
What kind of love from a nigga every night make you cry?
What kind of love from a nigga make you wish he would die?

I mean shit he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
But them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he brings
And you stayed, what made you fall for him?
That nigga had the power to make you crawl for him

I thought you was a doctor, be on call for him
Smacked you down 'cause he said you was too tall for him, huh?
That wasn't love, baby girl you was dreamin'
I could have killed you when you said
Your seed was growin' from his semen

Love is blind
And it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
