Here I come, ready or not
Here I come, ready to go
Here I come, ready or not
Here I come, ready to go

Something that you said
Goes round my head
I know I'm gonna ride tonight
You look at me
But all I want to see is you tonight

Nothing can stop me now
Nothing can stop me now
Just a question of time
I said nothing can stop me now
Nothing can stop me now
