I don't want to hear about it anymore
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore.
There's a fire in my heart
A pounding in my brain, it's driving me crazy.
We don't need to talk about it anymore.

Yesterday's just a memory; can we close the door?
I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say when you called me baby.

Don't say goodnight
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh, whoa, all the way.
