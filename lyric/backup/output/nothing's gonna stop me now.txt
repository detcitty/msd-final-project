Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now

There was a time
I couldn't get you out of my mind
And since the day you came
You tried to take control of me

Then came the day
I thought about running away
And now my bags are packed
Don't even think of holding me back

Nothing's gonna stop me now
And I don't wanna talk it over
I said nothing's gonna stop me now
