Well you rolled out of bed and stubbed your toe
And I heard you almost cuss
And I fought back the urge to laugh
Just listen to you fuss
Then you overdid the coffee
Couldn't get your hair just right
When I smiled and said good morning
You looked mad enough to fight

Well that's another side of you
That I'm in a love with too
