Oh baby
Say, now, you
You talk about The things I do
But baby, I yeah,
I'll try 'n' explain the reasons why

'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout the things
That we said late last night,
When every word I said
Just didn't come out right,
And you were so afraid
That I'd found someone new
But darlin', well, there's no need
