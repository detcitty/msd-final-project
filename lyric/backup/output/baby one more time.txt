Oh baby baby, oh baby baby
...
Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know
...
That something wasn't right there?
Oh baby baby, I shouldn't have let you go

...
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
...
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because...
My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)

When I'm not with you I lose my mind
