Susie sits all alone
She waits by the telephone
Joey's out having fun
Waits to call when
She's not at home

She gets scared and then takes off
And runs from the cover of love
He knows that he'll find her there
And knows what she's thinking of

I know the broken hearted
When I look in their eyes I see
Is it the world that's changing
And turning away from me

Why do we run
From the cover of love
