Turn me around, don't let me walk out forever
If there's a chance, the slightest chance, darling never say never
You know it's out of my hands, 'cos I'm in way over my head

But it won't take me long, you could blink and I'll be gone
In your dark oversight, there must be one last breath of our love

Chorus:
Now if there's something I can say, to make you see it half my way
Just tell me once, before I go
And if there's something I can do, to make it all back up to you
