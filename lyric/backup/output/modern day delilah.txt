She's a wizard with her shears
She's been turning heads for years
All the darlings and the dears
Say she's got the touch

An exclusive clientele
Oh she knows each one so well
No one dares to kiss and tell
She knows too much

She's a modern day Delilah
Keeps her scissors laser sharp
Once she finds your weakness
She'll cut you to the quick
Stab you in the heart
