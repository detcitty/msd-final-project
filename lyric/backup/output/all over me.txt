Well, the weatherman says it's gonna be a hot one
Heard it on the radio
Load up the boat, get your girl if you got one
Nice little breeze gonna blow

Baby, I'm on my way to come and get you
Meet me at the end of your drive
Grab your shades and your string bikini
And your Coppertone 45

Bring on the sunshine, bring on the good time
Girl, let me look at you
Jump in the front seat, kick up your bare feet
