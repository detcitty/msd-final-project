Ahh, crush, ahhh

I see ya blowin' me a kiss
It doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's going on baby
If you see something in my eye
Let's not over-analyze
Don't go too deep with it baby

So let it be, what it'll be
Don't make a fuss and get crazy over you and me
Here's what I'll do
I'll play loose
