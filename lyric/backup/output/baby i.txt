Baby I got love for thee
So deep inside of me, I don't know where to start
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah Yeah
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I love you more than anything
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
No No
(yeah yeah no no yeah yeah)

When I try to explain it, I'd be sounding insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied and twisted,
I can't explain what I'm feeling
And I say, baby baby (Woah woah), baby

(Baby I) Ooh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby I) ooh baby, Baby I (Baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words they only complicate it
