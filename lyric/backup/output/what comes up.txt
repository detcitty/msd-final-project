I left you, oh Lord, have mercy
Without saving a dime
Five little hungry babies
All in one room, crying

I thought I was so hip
(A big man)
A big man out in the world, yeah

I thought there was only
Two things in life to love for
A new car and big, fine girl

But I've had them both
Ooh, Lord, that's no joke
I had plenty of money in my pocket
Lord, when I used to always be broke
