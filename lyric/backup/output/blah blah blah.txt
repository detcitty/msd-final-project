Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
Coming out your mouth with your blah blah blah
Zip your lips like a padlock
And meet me at the back with the jack and the jukebox
I don't really care where you live at
Just turn around boy and let me hit that
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat
Just show me where your dick's at

Music's up
Listen hot stuff
I'm in love
With this song
So just hush
Baby shut up
Heard enough

Stop ta-ta-talking that
Blah blah blah
Think you'll be getting this
