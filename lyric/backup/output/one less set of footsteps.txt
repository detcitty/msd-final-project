We been runnin' away from
Somethin' we both know
We've long run out of things to say
And I think I better go

So don't be gettin' excited
Oh, when you hear that slammin' door
'Cause there'll be one less set of footsteps
On your floor in the mornin'

And we've been hidin' from somethin'
That should have never gone this far
But after all it's what we've done
Makes us what we are
