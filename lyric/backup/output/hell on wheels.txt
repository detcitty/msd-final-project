Well I'm hell on wheels, I'm a roller mama
I can slide down places that you never knew
Try me on for size at the roll-a-rama
If you tie my laces then I'll follow you
Follow you, Follow you

Chorus:
See something I like, gonna go for it
See something I want, I'm gonna go after it
See something I like, gonna go for it
See something I want... let's roll
Hell on wheels, let's roll
