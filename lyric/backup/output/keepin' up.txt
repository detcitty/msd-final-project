What's goin' on with the sun and the moon
'Cause one's goin' down to early, one's comin' up to soon
The hands on my old clock tell me once again that I'm fallin' behind
There's too much to do and not enough time

Keepin' up, I'm movin' as fast as I can
Keepin' up, in a circle that never ends
I can't stop like it or not I'm stuck
It's runnin' me to death and I'm out of my breath keepin' up
