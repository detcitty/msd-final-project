Now there was a time when they used to say
That behind every great man there had to be a great woman
But in these times of change you know that it's no longer true
So we're comin' out of the kitchen
'Cause there's somethin' we forgot to say to you, we say
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringin' on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Now this is a song to celebrate
The conscious liberation of the female state
