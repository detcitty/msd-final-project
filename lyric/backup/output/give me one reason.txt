Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Said I don't want leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby I got your number
Oh I know that you got mine
You know that I called you
I called too many times

You can call me baby
