Don't you know that I was sittin back in Texas
I was playing those rhythm and blues
And then I got a big offer
For more money than I could refuse
I had the chance to make it
Playing anything I wanted to play
But way back in my mind
You know I could hear the people say

Keep playing that rock and roll
Keep doing what you been told
Save your money up for when you get old
Got to keep playing that rock and roll

So I packed up and I made it up to New York
