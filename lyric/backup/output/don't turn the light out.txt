On my way home, I met an old friend of mine
We walked and we talked and shared a bottle of wine
We started to dance, my intentions were good
How could I know I'd be misunderstood?

I promised to call before the weekend was through
We'd all get together so she could meet you
I was just being friendly, I met her by chance
