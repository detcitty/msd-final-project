(Tray-Dee)
I bang with the gang that don't need no intro
We run from East Long Beach to West South Central
Credentials, to kick flows and rip shows,
dip 4's and pimp ho's while the indo blow
You know that west coast low mentality
Focused on reality but livin in a hole notha galaxy
We keep it straight hard but guard the spot
Bangas snatch chains in the parkin lot
Don't matta there still be fine ho's to gatha
Pick about the thickest bitch and I gots to hav ha
It's routine the coupe clean let's hit the sho
You know we all fuckin once they glimpse the po
Wit the satin in my hand pack the gat on my lap
Cuz it's hatin when your skaten and your pockets is fat
Don't act for a minute like your ass surprised
Just reconize the real way that gangsta's ride

(hook, Snoop)
If it ain't chronic don't blaze it up
And if it ain't a chevy don't raise it up
You know we keep it bangin don't fake the funk
So all the real niggaz stay gangsta'd up
We makein papa only suckas claim to touch
By stickin to the script and neva changin up
