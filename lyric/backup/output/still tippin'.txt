Come on
Still tippin' on four fours, rapped in four Vouges
Tippin' on four fours, rapped in four Vouges
Tippin' on four fours, rapped in four Vouges
Pimpin' four **** and I'm packin four fours

Now look who creepin', look who crawlin', still ballin' in the mix
Is that 6'6, long **** slim *****, stickin' your chick
Pullin' tricks, lookin' slick at all times when I'm flippin'
Bar sippin', car dippin', Grant Wood grain grippin'
Still tippin' on four Vouges rapped in four fours
Pimpin' four hoes and I'm packin four fours
Blowin' on that *****, Game Cube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window

These ***** don't understand me 'cause I'm Boss Hog on candy
Top down at Maxis with a big ***** 9 handy
Peaced up, creased up, stayin' dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell N Ess
Oh, Gucci shades up on my brades when I escalade
When I'm ridin', Spreewheels slidin' like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the north,
