Buck was born on a beautiful morning
And I felt very proud
Lets just say its not every day
That you see me cry out loud

Hair like sunshine, a smile as warm
And the prettiest eyes you'll find
One day last spring my lady and I
Found out those eyes were blind

Have a butterfly for me daddy
They sound so pretty to me
Tell me about the butterfly
And all the things you see
