I got a city folk friend in a hip-hop world
He goes by E. Diddy but his name is Earl
Cocks his hat to the side in his Grandma's ride
Pumpin' nothin' but bass

He says things like, 'Dawg, are you down with that'
And, 'Don't that fly girl got some back'
And I feel so doggone outta place

When he says,
'Holler back when you get back home'
I say, 'The only holler back that I know is'

(Chorus)
In that holler back in the woods
Where the country folks got it good
Homebrewed, homegrown
