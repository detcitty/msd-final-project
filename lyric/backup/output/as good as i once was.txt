She said I seen you in here before
I said I been here a time or two
She said Hello my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feelin' kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face... I said girls...

I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
