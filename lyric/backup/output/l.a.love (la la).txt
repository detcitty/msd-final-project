Uh, tell 'em where I'm from
Finger on the pump, make the sixth straight jump from SoCal
Hollywood to the slums
Chronic smoke get burnt by the California sun
On the west side, east coast where you at?
Just got to New York like a gnat on a jet
To London, to Brazil, to Quebec
Like the whole damn world took effect to Ferg
Tell 'em

Lay back, slow down
Better represent when we come to your town
Lay back, slow down
Whatchu represent when we come to your town
Say, get in with the business
I'ma be there in a minute
I just booked a Paris ticket
Thinking Russia need a visit
I'ma run it to the limit
And be on my way to Venice

L.A. got the people saying (la la la la la)
Brooklyn saying (la la la la la)
Hacienda saying (la la la la la)
