Hey yeah!

Well five thirty P.M. rolls around
There's a little old joint outside of town
I only got time for a couple of beers
And a jukebox song ringing in my ear

The next thing you know the bar tender's pouring
Shots are flowing, got me stoned man
All I really know is that I should be going
But I'm soaking up the moment

I'm all jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies when you're all jacked up

It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock
? What the hell, I'll have one more shot?
Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar
Guess I mighta musta gone a little too far
