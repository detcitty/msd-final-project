It's Young Dirty

Oh okay, what you need?

Ay, ay, Joc, what up, Pat man?
Cuz out here say he need two of them thangs
Oh yeah, he want two of 'em?
Yeah, ay Joc, what up?
You know the motto? Yeah
Hustle by any means ***

First I take they order like the coffee shop
Then I steam it up and cook it like the coffee shop
And then I serve it out the window like the coffee shop
Yeah, I'm comin' in, got my rims sittin' real big

And it ain't no returns at the coffee shop
Man, I make that paper stack up at my coffee shop
One hit and they'll be back to the coffee shop
Yeah, I'm comin' in, got my rims sittin' real big

Okay, it's just another day at the coffee shop
I grab them coffee beans, time to heat them coffee pots
Turn them lights on, J's rush the parkin' lot
