"ain't nobody talkin when I'm talkin fellas so shut the fuck up!"

{slick rick sample repeats in background:
"and who the fuck are you? "}
Ohh. steppin up in my motherfuckin uhh.
Chuck taylors, knick kickers, wallabee's,?
On my ass I got the umm. um. khakis, 501's
On my back I got the uhh. sweatshirt
You know, with the fat three creases
Uhh, my t-shirt, slingshot, uhh. khaki shirt
Umm, and I got the k-cutter, in my, in my pocket
Uhh, got the afro, the braids
Motherfuckin uhh, rollers
"you got to believe, somethin."
And I just ask my motherfuckin self, uhh
"i got to believe in me."
{"and who the fuck are you? "}
{"and who the fuck are you? "}

To g or not to g, is the question
And like smith told wesson
I'm shady with the .380 old school diploma
I'll leave that ass in a coma, so
If you got a herringbone, welcome to the terrordome
Two-eleven, sorry reverend
Oh my god, gettin robbed
Reach for the small, "atomic dog"
Hard to swallow, janky as rollo
Count to ten, and don't try to follow
Cause just like waco, I can take fo' --
-- atf, to they death
Bust a left on western, go and get a room
Don't want to be a felon like stacey koon
Get the right bitch, hit the light switch, here we go
Tap that ass like this - really doe
