Good is good and bad is bad
But you don't know which one you have
She put your books out on the sidewalk
Now they're blowin' round
But they don't help you when you're down

Loves on your list of things to do
To bring your good luck back to you
If you think everything's unfair
Would you care if you're the last one standing there

And every time you hear the rolling thunder
