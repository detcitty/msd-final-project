Intro
You know there comes a period in every womans life,
when she gets frustrated and fed up, with her man and
all his silly hang ups. You know a woman wants a man
she don't have to have no drama behind you, just
somebody who can love her down with no strings attached,
and his name is Splackavellie

verse 1
Tell me what kind of superman, would take you to his
bedroom baby, and hit you wit some front back and side to side.
Like hydraulics on a stormy nite and break you off something proper like.
