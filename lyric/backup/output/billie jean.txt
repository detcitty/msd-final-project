She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said dont mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

2nd verse
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one

Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And dont go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
