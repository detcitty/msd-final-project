Oh yes

Well looky here, looks here
Ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
Cause at the end of the night, it is her I'll be holding

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me, Baby, baby, please dont go away
But when I play, I never stay
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

Run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
