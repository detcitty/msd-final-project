Evening's settled down
Girl, I'm yours for the taking
I've got a fireplace to huddle round
Soon it's love we'll be making

Let's share our deepest secrets
And find the place that's weakest
And linger, mmmm

Oh, baby, do it to my mind
I betcha that'll get it
Do it to my mind
Sugar, take your time

We must have
Loved somewhere before
Cause you've got the key
To every part of me

Say I just want to love you, baby
Let me love you, baby
More and more

Do it to my mind
That'll get it
Do it to my mind

When we share a fantasy
Girl, let's make it one to treasure
Cause our love runs wild and free
As we growl from this pleasure

Each is better than the first
And the best becomes the worst
We keep on trying

Yeah, baby, do it to my mind
Betcha that'll get it
