All this time
I couldn't shake your memory
And I never knew the
Sweetest love was the first

So what am I supposed
To do about this curse
Oh, baby, I've got you to blame
And I'm calling
Calling out your name

Oh, he was so fine
Jimmy Lee, oh, he was so fine
Jimmy, Jimmy Lee

(Jimmy Lee)
Jimmy, Jimmy Lee
(Jimmy Lee)

Find me rushing off
To school every morning
Never had a care
Acting crazy, always laughing
When I'm running
Cause I knew you'd meet me
When I got there

Stealing kisses in the hall
Before the first bell
You smelled so fine
Though we'd just met
I guess you knew me so well
You had the number to my heartline

(Maybe he knew his stuff)
