Please don't talk about love tonight
Please don't talk about sweet love
Please don't talk about being true
And all the trouble we've been through
Ah, please don't talk about all of the plans
We had for fixin' this broken romance
I want to go where the people dance
I want some action
I want to live

Action, I got so much to give
I want to give it
I want to get some too

Ooooh I, I love the nightlife
