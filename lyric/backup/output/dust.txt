She's sick of this town, she's sick of that boy
Yeah she's sick of dreams that never take flight
There's gotta be more than the same old story
So she's gonna turn the page tonight
And turn the radio up (turn the radio up)
Roll the windows down
She got a full tank of gas (she got a full tank of gas)
Ain't no stopping her now

She's got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford,
Yeah, the only thing that's left to do
