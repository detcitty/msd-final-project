You can just... walk on
You can just go, walk on, keep on
You just go, walk on, keep on

Sittin', waitin', anticipatin'
Waitin' for your call
Tossin', turnin', my heart's burnin'
From the things I saw

I'm sorry baby
You can't play me
I just cant be used

I'm so fed up
Time to get up
Baby, we are through

I though that what we had would never end
