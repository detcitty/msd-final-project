Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar

I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute, seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die

And I'm not ashamed to say
