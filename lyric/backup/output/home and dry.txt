This silver bird takes me ‘cross the sky
Just one more hour and I'll be home and dry
‘Cross the ocean, way above the clouds I come stealin'.

Feelin' tired, but I feel good
Cause I did everything I said I would
I think of you, and I know how you'll be feelin'.

I gotta see you, I gotta be with you
We'll make it better now in every way
It's gotta be you, it's gotta be you
Yes from now on I'll tell you everyday.
