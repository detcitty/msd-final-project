As an only child of seventeen
It hurt when my momma died
When my daddy got home
Just a few days later
Well, he broke right down and cried

But after a year, he up and wed
A girl that was half his age
Then the family was my daddy
And me and Judy Mae

Well, my daddy did
A lot of traveling around
And before he would say goodbye
He'd tell me to
Take care of my new mama
She's the apple of his eye

And as he kissed his
