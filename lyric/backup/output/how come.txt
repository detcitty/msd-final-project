So I changed huh? You got a phone
pick it up, call me

How Come. we dont even talk no more
And you dont even call no more
We dont barely keep in touch at all
and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine. We even Beefin Now
After all the years we been down. aint no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We Family. aint a damn thing changed. unless its you!

We were so young
So full of life and vibrance
side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
with a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
and a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it.
You even had the same type of childhood I did.
sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succaim to yours
and mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it
we grew up, grew apart as time went by us.
and I blew up to both yours and mines surprises.
Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe it
much as your pride tries to hide it. you're cold
your touch is just like ice.
And your eyes is a look of resentment.
I can sense it and I dont like it.

How Come. we dont even talk no more
