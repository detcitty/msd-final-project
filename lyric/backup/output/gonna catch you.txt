I'm feelin' good like I knew that I would known
I'm gonna catch you, I'm gonna catch you baby

You know I'm leavin' this time anyway
So please don't stand in my way
I'm alright, just leavin' the past far behind
Your love, your feelin' kind

I don't like believin' so out lonely and round you go
I'd keep on runnin' and runnin' to you
You need somebody for lovin' and lovin' now till the end
