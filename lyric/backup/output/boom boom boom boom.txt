Whoaa whoaa
Whoaa whoaa
Vengaboys are back in town

Whoaa whoaa
Whoaa whoaa
Whoaa whoaa
Whoaa whoaa

If you're alone and you need a friend
Someone to make you forget your problems
Just come along baby, take my hand
I'll be your lover tonight

Whoaa whoaa
This is what I wanna do
Whoaa whoaa
Let's have some fun
Whoaa whoaa
One on one just me and you
Whoaa whoaa

Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
