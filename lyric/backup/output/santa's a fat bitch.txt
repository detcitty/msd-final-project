Slay bells jingle-lin', ring jin' jingle-lin'
Horses, horses, horses, horses
Slay bells jingle-lin' ring jin' jingle-lin'

Santa Claus suck my balls drunk as hell
Ringin' bells at the malls Dancer Prancer
Nixon and Cupid
I'ma get stupid, ha ha ha

Eh, I sat around all night under the chimney
Holdin' my sack like gimme gimme
I know that he's comin', he's comin'
He must lookin' up nothin' but rust, dust

Turn on my TV the very next day
I see your gettin' paid leadin the parade
I'm that sniper on the buildin'
Listen to my nine go click
Santa's a fat bitch

Santa Claus is a fat bitch
(Santa Claus is a fat, fat, fat bitch)
Another year and I ain't get shit
(Another year I ain't get shit)
If I hear him land on my roof
(Ohh, my undertaker)
I'm a bust your ass in the too-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooth

Yeah, I got somethin' to say about St.Nick
Fuck that hoe he never brought jack shit
No toys, candy canes, just a lump of coal
So I eat it, 'cuz there ain't nuttin' in the cupboard

So I'll be quick, quick and brief
