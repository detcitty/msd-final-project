Let's go down to the Sunset Grill
We can watch the working girls go by
Watch the basket people walk around and mumble
Stare out at the auburn sky
There's an old man there from the old world
To him, it's all the same
Calls all his customers by name

Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
Down at the Sunset Grill
