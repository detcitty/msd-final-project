Well your actin' like a prima donna
Playin' so hard to get
Actin' so cool and nonchalant
Draggin' on a cigarette

You keep a wall all around ya
I'll get through some day
I want your love babe, but push don't shove
Gonna chip that stone away

Chip away
Chip away at the stone
And I won't stop until your love is my very own
Chip away
That's what I'm gonna do
Sweet little mama I wanna get next to you
