Hey... hey... hey... whoa... whoa...
Oh...

You can think that I'm just playin' games
You can think I'll do you wrong
You can think that I don't mean a word I say
You can think what you want [what you want]

But if you think you're gonna stop the way
I feel about you
Baby, you're just wastin' your time
¡®cause I'm not changing my mind

Can't stop the rain from falling down, oh
Can't stop the world from turnin' ¡®round, oh
Can't stop my heart from loving you
No, no [no, no], no matter what you do, baby
