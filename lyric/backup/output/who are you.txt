We've met before
In the same room of my imagination
And it gets so hard to deal with
Out strike temptation, yes it does
Yesterday in my mind
You were here but now we've parted
You need to come on back
And finish what we started, oh baby
I need to know

Who are you
And where did you come from
(Where did you come from, baby)
