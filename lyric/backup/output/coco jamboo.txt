Ayyayaya coco jambo ayyayai

Ayyayaya coco jambo ayyayai
Put me up, put me down
Put my feedback on the ground
Put me up, take my heart

And make me happy
Put me up, put me down
Put my feedback on the ground
Put me up, feel my heart

And make me happy
Here we go, gettin' smooth to the groove

Watching lovely ladies, how I sooth as I move
'Cause that's what they say but I can't prove
So turn it up again and watch me move to the groove

As we get close, you whisper coco
I hold you in my arms and you say, "Jamboo"
