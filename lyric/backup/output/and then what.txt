Chea, let's get it

First I'm gone stack my flo'
(And then what?)
Then I'm gone stack some mo'
(And then what?)
Close shop then I do my count
Hide the rest of the yams at my auntie's house
(And then what?)

Get Fresh and jump in one of dem cars
(Yeah)
Hit the club and get one of dem broads
(And then what?)
It's a wrap, we on the way to the house
By 3: 45 I be kickin' her out
(Hey)

Patty cake, patty cake, microwave
These suckas make a square, damn I'm paid
(Ha ha)
I'm so cool, but I'm so hot, and I'm, I'm so fly
And you, you're so not
(Nope)
Show me what you're workin' wit just like that
(Like that)
Turn around, bend over, bring it back
(Bring it back)
Slow Mannie, Mannie Fresh bring it back
(Bring it back)
It's Mannie Fresh and Snowman, it's a wrap
