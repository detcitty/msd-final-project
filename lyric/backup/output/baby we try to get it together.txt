Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...

(We better try)
(Try to get ourselves together, baby)
Oh, we, oh, we better try
Try to get ourselves together, baby

Oh, girl, I swear I've got to talk to you
There's something that I feel we need to do
Let's take the time to try to figure out
What's happened to us, baby, what's it all about

We're getting further from each other every day
We can't just sit by and watch love walk away
If we don't try to save the love we got
