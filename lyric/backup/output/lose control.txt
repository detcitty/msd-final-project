Music make you lose control
Music make you lose control

Let's go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
(Here we go now, here we go now)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
(Here we go now, here we go now)

Misdemeanor's in the house
(Music make you lose control)
Ciara's in the house
Misdemeanor's in the house
Fatman Scoop-man, Scoop-man, Scoop

I got a cute face, chubby waist
Thick legs, in shape
Rump shakin', both ways
Make you do a double take

Planet rocker, show stopper
Flow proper, head knocker
Beat styler, tail dropper
Do my thang, motherfucker

My Rolls Royce, Lamborghini
Blue Madena, always beamin'
Rag top, chrome pipes
Blue lights, outta sight

Long weave, sewed in
Say it again, sewed in
Make that money, throw it in
Booty bouncin', gone head

Everybody here, get it out of control
Get your backs off the wall
'Cause Misdemeanor said so

Everybody
(Just throw your hands in the air)
(Just throw your hands in the air)
Everybody
