There comes a time, when you should see things clear
Free from my innocence, there is no circumstance too severe
Only the need for us, for us to believe again
There is a time, temptation's on the run
Dreamer you've had your way
Soldier you've had your day, in the sun
Now it's time, for us to begin again

Chorus:
