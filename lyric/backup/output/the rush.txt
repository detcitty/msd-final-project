Oh, what happened?
You know when love comes
It seems you're never ready
That's why they call it the rush

Running right through my head
[Incomprehensible]
(The rush)

Tell me, tell me are you there?
Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer?
See, I've prayed for peace and love like so many of us do
