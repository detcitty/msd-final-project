Girl I finally got you up in the seat of my old truck
And I bet you're wonderin' what we're gonna do
We could hit the county line, hell we do that all the time
Tell you what, if you don't mind, we could start with something new
Instead of waiting like we used to do

Let's start it with a goodnight kiss, my lips, your lips,
Baby let's just keep gettin' there
