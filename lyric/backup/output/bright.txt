I think the universe is on my side
Heaven and Earth have finally aligned
Days are good and that's they way it should be

You sprinkle stardust on my pillow case
It's like a moon beam brushed across my face
Nights are good and that's the way it should be

You make me sing 'oohh la la laa'
You make a girl go 'oohh oohh'
I'm in love, love
