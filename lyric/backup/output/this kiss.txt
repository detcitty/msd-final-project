I don't want another heartbreak
I don't need another turn to cry, no
I don't want to learn the hard way
Baby, hello, oh, no, goodbye
But you got me like a rocket
Shooting straight across the sky

It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, impossible
This kiss, this kiss (unstoppable)
This kiss, this kiss

Cinderella said to Snow White
