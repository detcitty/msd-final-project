My sexy love
(So sexy)

Mmm
She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch and I errupt
Like a volcano and cover her with my love

Babygirl, you make me say,
"Ooh ooh ooh."
And I just can't think
(Of anything else I'd rather do)

Than to hear you sing
(Sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing
(When we do the things we do)
Mmm babygirl, you make me say
"Ooh ooh ooh."
Sexy love, girl, the things you do
