Full term love [x2]

[Verse 1]
To be or not to be that is the question
Brothers be hawking sisters sometime with no intention
of tryna get serious, I mean make a commitment
Come on honey insecurity flows in by the shipment
Pardon the expression but are you already taken
I live around the way boy so don't be tryna fake
And if you wanna know me better I suggest you follow
'Cause I ain't tryna start up nothing destined to be hollow
You say you understand good no need for me to wonder
Wanna be my man alright well here's my name and number
