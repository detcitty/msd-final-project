We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then I wanna feel that way again

Been so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck
Remind me, remind me
So on fire so in love. Way back when we couldn't get enough
Remind me, remind me
