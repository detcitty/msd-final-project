Is it a bird, is it a plane?
But beyond is lover
Is it a bird, is it a plane?
It's the superman lover

I'm stronger than a locomotive, yeah
That old saying is true
But I can't understand sometimes, babe
Why I'm so weak for you

Listen
I can leap tall buildings in a single bound
When it come to getting over you, baby
Well, I can't get off the ground

But they call me the Superman lover, yeah
