Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees
(Undone)
The boys break their necks

Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek
(At us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be fallin' in love

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
California girls, we're undeniable
