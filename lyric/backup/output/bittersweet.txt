Every now and then
I still get a flashback
Of the time I spent
Thinking you could be that one
Should I have just kept your love?

As I understand,
We did have some good times
On the other hand,
Got me crying all night
It was too much for my mind

So even though I left you
I can't forget you

'Cause when I think about you
It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet
Guess I'll always love you
It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet

When we were together
You ain't treat me right
Damn I really love you
