I miss the sound of your voice
I miss the rush of your skin
I miss the still of the silence
As you breathe out and I breathe in

If I could walk on water
If i could tell you whats next
Make you believe
Make you forget

Come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

Come on get higher
Loosen my lips
Faith and desire
And the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
