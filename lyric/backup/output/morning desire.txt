Here it's seven in the am,
It's gonna take more then wakin' to rise me
I wake up with this need again
But feel the love of the woman beside me
It's just one of those days

When I wanna lay here with her
And love her before I leave
And listen to the rain fall up on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves
