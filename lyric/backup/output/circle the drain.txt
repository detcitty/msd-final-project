This is the last time you say
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday, nothin'to celebrate
You give a hundred reasons why
And say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I'd own the bank...
I thought that I was the exception
I could rewrite your addiction
You could've been the greatest
But you'd rather get wasted
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forte
