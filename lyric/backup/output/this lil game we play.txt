Yo, baby
You ready to let the games begin?
'Cause I'm ready
On your mark, get set
Here we go, check it

Girl, I want you to stay
So we can play this little game we play
You go hide and I will seek
Let me be the one to make you weak

Boy, I really wanna stay
And play that little game you play
But you go hide and let me seek
Let me be the one to make you weak

Ah, yeah, first verse
I'm thinkin' about you, everyday
Got me feelin' kinda freaky
Girl, why you wanna leave me that way

Boy, I don't wanna leave you
So I'll stay for a little while
But we play by my rules
'Cause being loose just ain't my style
No, no, no, no, oh
