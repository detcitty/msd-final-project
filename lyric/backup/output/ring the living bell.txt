Ring the living bell
Ring the living bell
Shine the living light
Shine the living light
Ring the living bell
Ring the living bell

RING THE LIVING BELL

Been celebrating 'way too long
'n' I've been drinkin', I'm ashamed to tell
Still feel thirsty
God I want to drink the water from the well
Still feel thirsty
God I want to drink and ring the living bell
Ring the bell, ah
Ring the living bell
Still feel thirsty
God, I want to give and ring the living bell
