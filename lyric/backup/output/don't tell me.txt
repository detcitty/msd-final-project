Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the wind not to blow
'Cause you said so, mmm-hmm

Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time, no, no
Let it fall by the way
But don't leave me where I lay down

Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not but
