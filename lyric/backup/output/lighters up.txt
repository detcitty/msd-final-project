I come from Bed-Stuy, niggas either do or they gon' die
Gotta keep the ratchet close by
Someone murdered, nobody seen, nobody heard it
Just another funeral service
Niggas will get at you, come through shinin' they yap you
In broad day light kidnap you
Feds get clapped too, police stay on us like tattoos
Niggas only grind cause we have to
Money is power, sling crack, weed and powder
Fiends come through every hour
It's about that dollar and we nuh deal with cowards
Weak lambs get devoured by the lion
In the concrete jungle, the strong stand and rumble
The weak fold and crumble, it's the land of trouble
Brooklyn, home of the greatest rappers
BIG comes first, then the Queen comes after

Now put ya lighters up
Bed Stuy put ya lighters up
New York put ya lighters up
DC keep puttin' ya lighters up
Philadelphia put ya lighters up
Detroit put ya lighters up
Chi-Town keep puttin' dem lighters up
No matter where you from put ya lighters up

Now lemme give you a walk through
Show ya what to do and ya don't do
Where it's not safe to go to
Dem boys approach you
