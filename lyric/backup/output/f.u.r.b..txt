Oh oh
Oooh
No no no

(You know there is two sides to every story)

See I don't know why you cryin' like a bitch
Talkin' shit like a snitch
Who are you to write a song 'bout me
If you really didn't care
You wouldn't wanna share
Tellin' everybody just how you feel

Fuck what i did, it was your fault somehow
Fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out
Fuck all the cryin', it didn't mean jack
Well guess what yo, fuck you right back

Fuck what I did, it was your fault somehow
Fuck the presents, I threw all that shit out
Fuck all the cryin' it didn't mean jack
