You make it look like it's magic (Oh yeah)
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so used to being used

So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So Imma care for you, you, you
Imma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
