This is it (what?!)
Luchini pourin' from the sky
Lets get rich (what?!)
The cheeky vines
The sugar dimes
Cant quit (what?!)
Now pop the cork and scream the vigga
And get lit (what?! what?! what?!)
Verse one:
Introducin' phantom of the dark
Walk through my heaven with levitation
From efficient
And these leathers showboatin with rugars
Flash vines belafonte vigga
Lets get for what it's worth
As we confiscate your figgas
Cassanova brown levitatin jiggy in da shiggy's
In la hotta car 54 chasin diamond runners
Headin ice bound, where every chilla dime can get
Your harlem buck strut freezin world hice hollywood
Madame butterfly let me in your house of pleasure
From the knuckle swat shadowboxin catchin black-eye blues
I play the deef (what?!)
Sensations at the monte barbie screamin (cheeba!)
For fillin pleasures at my castles (blow the smoke out!)
The boss of vegas substitutes when the dutch is gone
The lo don't stop give me shouts
Its the season sauters
Souflers for swervin no corners
We magnets to moolah
Livin wit charlie's angels hornets
No smilin were slidin
That gets you caught up in the octa
