I been laid off from work my rent is due
My kids all need brand new shoes
So I went to the bank to see what they could do
They said Son looks like bad luck got a hold on you

Money's too tight to mention
I can't get an unemployment extension
Money's too tight to mention

I went to my brother to see what he could do
He said Brother I'd like to help but I'm unable to
So called on my father, father
Oh almighty father, he said

Money's too tight to mention
Oh money money money money
