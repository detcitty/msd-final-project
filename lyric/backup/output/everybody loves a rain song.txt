I heard about it raining on a Georgia night
Never saw clearly in the morning light
I was walkin', just walkin' in the rain

She was a rainy day woman
She made me love her
Took my soul and I soon discovered
I was searchin', searchin' for rainbows

Everybody loves a rain song
'Cause everybody's been rained on
It's like a shoulder you can lean on
One time or another stormy weather
