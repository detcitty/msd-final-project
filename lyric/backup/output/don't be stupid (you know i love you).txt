You're so complicated - you hang over my shoulder
When I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they're on my tail

I get so aggravated when I get off the phone
And get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me
And you'll see

Don't freak out until you know the facts
