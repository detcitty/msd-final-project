I'm wiser now
I'm not the foolish girl
You used to know
So long ago

I'm stronger now
I've learned from my mistakes
Which way to go
And I should know

I put myself aside
To do it in your way
But now I need
To do it all alone

And I am not afraid
To try it on my own
I don't care
If I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what
