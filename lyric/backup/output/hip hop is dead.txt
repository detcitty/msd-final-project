Hip hop
Is dead

(Had to flip this track again, y'all)
Hip, hip hop
Hip hop
Is dead

Hip, hip hop
Hip, hip hop
Is dead

(NYC, Dirty South)
Hip, hip hop
(West Coast)
Hip hop
(Midwest)
Hip hop
(Let's go)

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ

Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead

Yeah, people smoke, chill, party, and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers, on the llama
