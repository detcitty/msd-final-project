They see me rollin'
They hatin', patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

My music so loud I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gone catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tense, so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by they can see these gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen

Now ridin' with a new chick, she like "Hold up"
Next to the Play station controlla
It's a full clip and my pistolla
Send a jacker into a coma

Girl you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me

Music turned up all the way to the maximum
I got speakers, some niggaz tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for um
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum, security cell

I'm grippin' oak
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twins steady twistin' like "Hit this dough"
D's behind and it's in rethrowed

Windows down, gotta stop pollution
City change just like, "Who is that producin'?"
That's the Play N Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston, but I still ain't losin'

They see me rollin'
They hatin', patrollin and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty
