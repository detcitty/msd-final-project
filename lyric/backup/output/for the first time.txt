She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart
While I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar and we don't know how
How we got into this mad situation,
only doing things out of frustration
Trying to make it work,
but, man, these times are hard

She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time
I got a new job now on the unemployment line and we don't know how
How we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best
Trying to make
work, but, man, these times are hard

But we're gonna stop by drinking our cheap bottles of wine
