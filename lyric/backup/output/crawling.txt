Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming
Confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling
I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
