It's been so long, you say you've had fun
And you've been happy with the things you've done
Now you feel strange and a little unreal
Well I can understand the way you feel
You're just a little in love (just a little)
You're just a little in love (just a little)

Well I can see what's happening to you
You feel alone, but it's just not true
And there's one thing you ought to know
Whoo, I need you so
