I could feel you the moment that you walked into the room
Oh baby, oh
What I felt I wondered if I felt too much too soon
I can't help myself, something draws me to you
How in just a moment's time can all of me pursue you

What's too much
When the fascination keeps on growing by the minute
What's too much
Should I hold back something or just throw my whole self in it
What's too much
