Hello, my old friend
Come to talk to you again
Cause a vision softly creeping
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping

And this vision that was planted
In my brain still remains within
The sound, sound, sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
