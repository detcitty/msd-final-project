Sun tanned toes ticklin' the sand
Cold drink chillin' in my right hand
Watchin' you sleep in the evenin' light
Restin' up for a long, long night.

'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' all right
When the sun sinks down, over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.
Yeah!

All day long just takin' it easy
Layin' in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleepin' off the night before
'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more.
