Alright, watch out

Now my daddy was hard shelled Alabama preacher
My momma was a dedicated Sunday school teacher
My brother went to college and got a PhD
Daddy said the only dud in the family was me

He said, "Boy, you ain't never going to amount to a thing
You set around with that silly looking guitar and sing
You hang around them juke joints all the time
Making music like some wild man done lost his mind"

Going sock it to me
Well, what's that supposed to mean
Boy, you just a wild man
