Mama's in her kitchen
She's stirrin' in a pot
Daddy's sittin' waiting to see what she's got
He's sitting by the fireplace with his hands on his
Knees
He looked around at mama said, "Hey, you better come
See about me."
Let's get funky
Yea, get it on
Right on
Now every time I see you
You know you're lookin' cool
You're lookin' like you want to do it
But, you ain't got the tools
I wanna teach you somethin' that's not from the Golden
