I can feel it floating away
Inch by inch, day by day
Love boat set itself free
Castaway, slipping out to sea

I can feel it coming adrift
Even a blind man could see the rift
From an ocean liner to a Chinese junk
There ain't been a ship that can't be sunk

I used to dream it could last forever
But pipe dreams never come true
I'd be foolin' myself if I never
Thought something like this
