(Written by J.D. Martin, Paul Begaud & Vanessa Corish)

How can I believe
That my heart would find someone like you
You see me, the real me
No in bewteens, I had nowhere to hide
You took away the walls around me
Made me feel safe to share my truth.

I see the heavens open, a heart that once was broken
Is holding nothing back
