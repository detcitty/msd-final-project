CAM'RON
Miscellaneous
Aiyyo, you might see Cam in designer underwear
new reclining leather chair, reminders everywhere
how we pull up in whips, the minors stop and stare
and when it comes to girls, they behind us everywhere
I mean, when I hang up on 'em, they pressin' redial
I mean what the fuck is it, why you stressin' me child
It'd be one thing if you were finessin' my style
But when I go to court, you know the dress of the trial
You not my wife, so if I ask head I be fowl
you better be down, the only question better be 'how'
Threaten' me now, bet me a thou, no dirl deadin' me now
In the SC we're gone, are you sexy in thongs
If you'll sex in the Lex and your head be the bomb
I'll get you that stuff that Gretzky skate on
(What you mean "Gretzky be on"?) Ice
(Oh you're gonna buy me diamonds?!)
Shut the fuck up
