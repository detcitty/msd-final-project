I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass
I'm a player and I'm playin' jus' the bass

You see I made up my mind when I was seventeen
I ain' with no marriage and a weddin' ring
I be a player fo' life so where's my wife
Prob'ly at the rehab stuck on the pipe
'Cause she must be smokin' and I'm not jokin'
Too Short baby comin' straight from Oakland
Got way mo' bitches than I ever need
I put that on a big fat bag of weed
'Cause I can give you a bitch who wouldn't give you joint
Bitches ain' shit and now I made my point
So you can light that weed
While I spit this rap
And tell you 'bout a player from way back
I was only fourteen when I first got my dick sucked
Now I'm grown up and I really like to bust nuts
Gittin' freaky in the right situations
You wanna rap well that's a nice occupation
To git pussy when you want 'n how you want it foo'
'Cause I was fuckin' ugly hoes back in high schoo'
I used to fuck young-ass hoes
Used to be broke and didn't have no clothes
Now I fuck top notch bitches
Tellin' stories 'bout rags to riches
'Bout a pimp named Shorty from the Oakland set
