It's gonna be a party y'all
Keith Murray rocks, wide and universal and most come
Combine with R. Kelly and prove it can be done
Non-stoppin', Def squad and Rockland
I here somebody knockin', yo, R the party's startin'

Step into the crib with me tonight
Kelly's in the mood to make it right
Word is gettin' all over town
The party's over here and gettin' down, yeah

Hands in the air, drinks everywhere
Party in the hills, keepin' it real
Guests from out of town, ladies all around
Me and the crew, doin' what we do

Beat is bangin' up and down your spine
And all the single women here are fine
Let your body give into your soul
Release the freak and you will lose control

Girl, there's a party goin' on, my temperature's warm
So let me freak you to the floor, while the bass is thumpin'
All night if your body can handle it

Hands in the air, drinks everywhere
