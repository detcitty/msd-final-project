Woke up this morning with my heart on fire
Held on to what I'd been dreaming
Woke up this morning I had one desire
To get back to what I'd been seeing

Heaven, it was heaven,

I have never know any like this,
Witnessed anything like this
Glowing all over as I started on my feet
I thought that I heard somebody calling

Heaven, it was heaven,
