I don't know, I don't know which side I'm on.
I don't know my right from left or my right from wrong.
They say I'm a fool, they say I'm nothing
But if I'm a fool for you oh, that's something.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts beat as one.
Two hearts.

I can't stop to dance
Honey, this is my last chance
I said, can't stop to dance
Maybe this is my last chance.
Two hearts beat as one.
