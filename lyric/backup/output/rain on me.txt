I'm lookin' in the mirror
At this woman down and out
She's internally dyin'
I know this was not what love's about

I don't wanna be this woman
The second time around
'Cause I'm wakin' up screamin', no longer believin'
That I'm gonna be around

And over and over I tried
Yet over and over you lied
And over and over I cried,

And over and over I tried
Yet over and over you lied
And over and over I cried, yeah
I don't know why

Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me
