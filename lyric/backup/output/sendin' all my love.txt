Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you
Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you

I see you lookin' at her, baby
It's not hard to do
And even though she's been your baby
It's me for you

She captures every eye all the time
I know when I catch yours, you'll be mine
I've got so much to say
Until you look my way

Sendin' all my love to you, baby
