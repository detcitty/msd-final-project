I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

So I'm supposed to believe that it's Fellini's calling your phone?
I'm s'posed to believe that they're asking you if you're home
I wasn't born yesterday, not me
Can't get that over me, not me
I love you but I won't be a fool for you
That is just something that I wouldn't do, babe
I mean I'mma stay if you could tell the truth

But you can't, no matter how much time I ask

Is that your bitch over there, giving' me the ugly stare
The one with the silicone ass, and the Brazilian hair

You ain't gon' respect me no no no till I'm not there
See, I got you comfortable, now you ain't really scared
