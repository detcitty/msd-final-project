Last night, outta the blue
Driftin' off to the evening news
She said, "Honey, what would you do
If you'd have never met me"

I just laughed, said "I don't know,
But I could take a couple guesses though"
And then tried to dig real deep,
Said, "Darling honestly...

I'd do a lot more offshore fishin'
I'd probably eat more drive-thru chicken
Take a few strokes off my golf game
If I'd have never known your name

I'd still be driving that old green â€˜Nova
