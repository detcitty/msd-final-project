I'm at a stage in my life where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything

Sipping on Dom PÃ©rignon for no reason
Popping tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that ace, bought a case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me

Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds on me dancing

And you know what I need from you when I get home
You better not be on the phone
Talking up a storm like you usually do
Talking up your friends like you usually do
Telling them I never spend time with you
It's hard to find a time we been
