Who da hell you think you messin' wit
Tryin' to play me like a fool
I overheard a conversation
Between your ex-girlfriend and you
Then I saw it so clearly
Suddenly it all made since
Before you go on explaining yourself
Let me explain my evidence

[CHORUS:]
No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
