Finally out the motherfuckin' C P T
Off to other cities and shit, no longer just an underground hit
Moving thangs, a local nigga made good
And made a name off of making tapes for niggaz in the hood
And now, let me tell a little story
About the places that I been to and the shit that I been through
Like fightin' and shootouts and bangin' and shit
All because a nigga made a hit, check it

Nineteen ninety one, it was double or nothin' that a nigga would hit
Then we broke out with the fonky shit
About bitches and niggaz and gettin' drunken off that bud
I was doing the shit they hadn't heard of
But foolish was I to think that it wasn't no other cities like this
And that they didn't like this
That Compton was the home of a foot in yo ass, where you got blast
And now that's just a thing of the past

Let me tell ya why firsthand, we did a show up in Oakland
And niggaz was kickin' up sand, to them bangin' ain't nothin' new
And slangin' ain't nothin' new
And for every nigga we done shot they done shot two
Straight through and on since the sixties before I was born
Families of young niggaz mourn
So I'm just letting you know
That if ya plan to take a trip to the bay keep your hand on the clip

Because Oakland
(It's jus lyke Compton)
Yeah, I'm telling y'all Oakland
(It's jus lyke Compton for y'all)

Moving on to St. Louis, where the country is fucked
With gold teeth ain't hey mouth, but they still know what's up
