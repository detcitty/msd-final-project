Just wakin up in the morning
And the beat well
Quite honest with ya
I ain't really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train a thoughts been derailed?
That's when you press on. Lee nails.
Half the population's just waitin to see me fail
Yeah right, you're better off tryina freeze hell

Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retails
But I do it for the kids, life through the tower head on
Everytime you fall its only making your chin strong

And I'll be in your corner like Mick baby, til the end

Or when you hear the song from that big lady

Until the referee rings the bell

Until both your eyes start to swell

Until the crowd goes home

What we gonna do ya'll?

Give em hell, turn their heads

Gonna live life til we're dead.
