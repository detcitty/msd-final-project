I ain't much on Casanova
Me and Romeo ain't never been friends
Can't you see how much I really love you?
Gonna sing it to you time and time again

Oh, Casanova, Casanova
Oh, Casanova, Casanova

Every man deserves a good woman
And I want you to be my wife
Time is so much better spent with you, baby
With a woman just like you in my life

So let me love you
Fill you up inside, I want to hold you, baby
So let me squeeze you
Don't you know that I'll get down on my knees for you, baby?

You see, I ain't much on Casanova
Me and Romeo ain't never been friends
Can't you see how much I really love you?
Gonna sing it to you time and time again

Oh, Casanova, Casanova
Oh, Casanova, Casanova
