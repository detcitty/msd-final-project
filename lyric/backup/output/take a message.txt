How did she fall in love, 
Tired and shaken up,
Could it be hangin' around's enough 
No one was foolin' when we're told about the sense and sensibilty in movin' on 


ALL that I see is that we're livin' life 
Did you fail when you found that you paid the price, 
Hope it wasn't lost in an honest truce
The past doesn't break all that we been through
Every little thing that you did was right 
Who knows what you did on the day you cried endlessly 0oo you cried endlessly 


Take a message from my love, Take a message from my love Take a message 
Take a message from my love, Take a message from my love Take a message 
Take a message from my love, Take a message from my love Take a message
