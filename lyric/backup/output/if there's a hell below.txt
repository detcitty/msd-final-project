Sisters, Brothers And The Whities 
Blacks And The Crackers 
Police And Their Backers 
They're All Political Actors 

Hurry, People Running From Their Worries
While The Judge And His Juries 
Dictate The Law That's Partly Flaw. 
Cat Calling Love Balling Fussing And Cussing 


Top Billing Now Is Killing 
For Peace No One Is Willing 
Kind Of Make You Get That Feeling

Everybody Smoke 
Use The Pill And The Dope 
Educated Fools
