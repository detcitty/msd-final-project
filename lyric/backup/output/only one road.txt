I'm looking back, through the years, down this highway.
Memories, they all lead up to this one day.
And many dreams lost along the way, haunt me still,
I guess they always will.

When love was too much to bear, I just left it there.
Here I stand face to face, with this heart of mine.
Livin' without you I only fall behind.
We had a love most people never find.
