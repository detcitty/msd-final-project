Tick-tock

Tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock

Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
La la la la la la la
I'm like a cat-in-heat stuck in a moving car
A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake

What if they say that you're a climber?
Naturally I'm worried if I do it alone
Who really cares 'cause it's your life
You never know, it could be great
Take a chance 'cause you might grow
Oh, uh oh

What you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting
