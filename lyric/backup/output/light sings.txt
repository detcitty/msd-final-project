The sun comes up
The moon goes down
A new day's on it's way

The stars in the sky
Are waving goodbye
And morning's here
Bringing in the day

Then the kids start to shout
Mother and Father, get up
And here's the sun

Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world

Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
All over the world
Light sings
