She take my money, when I'm in need
Yeah she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger, way over town
That digs on me
(She give me money) Now I ain't saying she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messing with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now I ain't saying she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messing with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm

She said I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm

Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm and your arm
But I'm looking for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena

Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
