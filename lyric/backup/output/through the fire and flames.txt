On a cold winter morning, in a time before the light
In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down and the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight

Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell, bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain we watch them as we go
In fire and pain and once again we know

So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls
