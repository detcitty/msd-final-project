...
Something ain't right
...
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself
I'm gonna get myself connected
I ain't gonna go blind
For the light which is reflected
I see thru you
I see thru you
I see thru you
I see thru you
Ya dirty tricks
Ya make me sick
I see thru you
I see thru you

I'm gonna do it again

I'm gonna do it again
Oh!
I'm gonna do it again
Gotta do right
'Cause something ain't right
Gotta do right
Come on
If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
