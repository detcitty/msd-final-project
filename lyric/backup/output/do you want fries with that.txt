I thought that was your voice
I thought that was my car
No, we ain't ever met before
But I know who you are

You're living in my house
And I'm living in a tent
And don't laugh, this second job of mine
Is paying both our rents

You're out here buying Happy Meals
And I'm eating rice and pintos
You so much as crack a smile at me, man
I'll come through this here window

Well, you took my wife
And you took my kids
