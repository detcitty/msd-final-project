Consider this an invitation, to my gangsta nation

Na na na na na na na na
(Westside)
Na na na na na na na na
(Ohh ohh)
Na na na na na na na na
(What what)
Na na na na na na na na

Na na na na na na na na
(Yeah yeah)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

This day right here is really rough
These girls out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what

And in five beers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through they'd run it up
We still right here don't fresh your luck

Homey, I'm tired of the cowards parkin' like this, walkin' like this
From the concrete when they chalkin' like this
And there he goes and a trick pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gack ain't gonna bust and know that

It's a dub ass C thang dub C brain
And we don't kick it but bust it and kaki jeans strains
I'm done movin', I'm clearin' the crowd
It's the who bangin' bandanna criminiminal, the original

Evacuate the building look here come a plane
No, it's the big bad Westside Connect Gang
And bump what you plain homey this who bang
With enough game to drive a swear broad insane

And we number one gunners no we ain't stunners
