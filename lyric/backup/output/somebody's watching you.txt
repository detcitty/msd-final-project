Pretty pretty pretty as a picture
Witty witty witty as you can be
Blind, 'cause your eyes see only glitter
Closed to the things that make you free

Ever stop to think about a downfall
Happens at the end of every line
Just when you think you pulled a fast one
Happens to the foolish all the time

Somebody's watching you
