As you brush your shoes
Stand before the mirror
And you comb your hair
Grab your coat and hat

And you walk wet streets
Tryin' to remember
All the wild night breezes
In your memory ever

And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin', cryin'
