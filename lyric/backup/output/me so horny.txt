What'll we get for ten dollars?
Everything you want
Everything?
Everything
Ooh, don't do that, baby, hold on this
Oh, sock it to me

Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time
Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time

Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time
Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time

Sittin' at home with my dick on hard
So I got the black book for a freak to call
Picked up the telephone, then dialed the 7 digits
Said, "Yo, this Marquis, baby, are you down with it?"

I arrived at her house, knocked on the door
Not having no idea of what the night had in store
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warnin'
I have an appetite for sex, 'cause me so horny

Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
Me love you long time
Me so horny, me so horny, me so horny
