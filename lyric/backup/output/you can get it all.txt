I know you heard my reputation
You dont think i would ever do right by you
You think that if you and i was in a relationship
I would never be true (be true)
You think that anything i say is straight gang
and to me your just another new name
But what im tryna tell you for every man
theres a woman that'll make him change
And i believe you the one that'll make me
but any time i try to show you you shake me
I know i make it real hard for you to take me serious
but baby girl i am (i am)
And i aint stoppin right here, ima keep going
And im gona make sure everyday tat you keep knowing
