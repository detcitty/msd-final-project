Alexander
Lytton
was
here

I'm just what you made God
Not many I trust
I'mma go my own way, God
Take my faith to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son
Won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryin' to get me some
Bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin' bakin'
Drinkin', contemplatin', ain't no such thing as Satan
Evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush
Now you don't be worryin' 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down

I say, "Ain't no music on" she said, "Naw, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin'
Lost heart, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing
