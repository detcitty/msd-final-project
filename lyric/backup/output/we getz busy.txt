f/ Erick Sermon

[Malik]
Yo, check it out
Coming right back at you
with another slamming hit
Illegal in the motherfuckin house
With Erick Sermon, takin over in the 90's, youknowhatI'msayin?
E-Double on the solo tip
and this how we gonna do it
We gettin buzy on this track
Aiyyo, check it
Do ya like this

Malik'll play the lawnmover, and Kris'll play the grass
I just ate MC's, cause why? ABC whipped!
Illegal cuts that ass, the way that I will punch you
wouldn't think I was a kid G, that's why I took the time out
to say that I gets buzy, like Dizzy, Gillespie
So suckers stretch your eyes, but you still couldn't see me
Now, skippidy-doo-dah, di-di-di da-di-day
I don't need no permission, I still come out and play
To Uncle Sam I say, "Scram!"Say my numbers aren't enough
but to get wreck with the army, all I have to be is rough
and tough, and no need to lie about my age
Just get fly with my tongue, and go on a rampage
I'm going off, because it's Little Malik
And no sucker, it's not all about maturity
Now if you want beef, fuck it, cause a fuss
