I remember back a long time ago, in the days of my childhood
In the evenin' when the sun was sinkin' low, walkin' in the wildwood
Skippin' and flippin' through the flowers, we'd go hand-in-hand
Lookin' back on all the happy hours, anyone one could understand
You and me, babe, sure 'nough got to be, babe

Birds of a feather, na na na na na na na na
