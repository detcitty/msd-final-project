We're both looking for something
We've been afraid to find
It's easier to be broken
It's easier to hide

Lookin' at you
Holdin' my breath
For once in my life
I'm scared to death
I'm takin' a chance
Letting you inside

We're feelin' alive all over again
As deep as the sky under my skin
Like bein' in love, she says
For the first time

Maybe I'm wrong
I'm feelin' right
