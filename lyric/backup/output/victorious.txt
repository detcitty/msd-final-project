Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends were glorious
Tonight we are victorious

Oh oh oh oh victorious
Oh oh oh oh

Double bubble disco queen
Headed to the guillotine
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen
Let me be your killer king
It hurts until it stops
We will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white
Eyes like broken Christmas lights

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch drunk kiss
I know you need it
