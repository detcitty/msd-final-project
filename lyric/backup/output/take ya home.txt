From the C-O to across the seas
I'm guaranted to make everybody bounce with me
Been known to rip it down anyplace I be
You can copy but' it's only gonna be one me
I don't ride no cars till a man come with me
14 And I started up a whole epidemic
Look, ya'll know what I'm talkin about
Ever since I hooked up with the homie down south
TV shows, Magizine covers
Girls in groups sayin, "We go with each other."
Sold out shows pocket full of cake
What you know about selling tres mill out the gate?
I'm the hottest thing around
Neck full of bling, bling like neptune sound
I got it locked on the left, right, front and rear
When I step in the spot this all I hear

I said lil' Bow Wow You just don't
The way you move so fast across the floor
I mean you run through my mind like all the time
