From the bad lands came the killer
He lived by the knife and the gun
He'd cut you just for standing
And shoot ya if ya tried to run
He was big as a tree and did as he pleased
And everything he did was bad
And they said if you was to kill him
It'd only make him mad

From the good lands came the cowgirl
Patti was her name
She was hot on the trail of that killer
