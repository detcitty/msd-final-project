Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at?
Come on

If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
Wit three women in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way?
Hey, must be the money

If you wanna go and get high wit me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benzy
Oh why must I feel this way?
Hey, must be the money

In the club on the late night, feelin' right
Lookin' tryin' to spot somethin' real nice
Lookin' for a little shorty I noticed
So that I can take home

She can be 18 wit an attitude or
19 kinda snotty actin' real rude
But as long as you a thicky thicky
Thick girl you know that it's on

I peep something comin' towards me
On the dance floor, sexy and real slow
Sayin' she was peepin' and I dig the last video
So when Nelly, can we go, how could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34

I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there

If you wanna go and take a ride wit me
Wit three women in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way?
Hey, must be the money

If you wanna go and get high wit me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benzy
Oh why must I feel this way?
Hey, must be the money
