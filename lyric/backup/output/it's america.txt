Drivin' down the street today
Saw the sign for lemonade
They were the cutest kids
I've seen in this front yard

As they handed me my glass
Smiled and thinkin' to myself
Man what a picture perfect postcard this would make
Of America

It's a high school prom
It's a Springsteen song
It's a ride in a Chevrolet
It's a man on the moon
And fireflies in June
Kids sellin lemonade
