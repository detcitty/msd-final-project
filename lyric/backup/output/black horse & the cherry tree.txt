Well my heart knows me better than I know myself

So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere

With a big black horse and a cherry tree
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
I felt a little fear upon my back

I said don't look back, just keep on walking
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
Well the big black horse said, "Look this way"

He said, "Hey lil' lady, will you marry me?"
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)
But I said,? No no, no, no no no?
