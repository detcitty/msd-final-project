Aiyyo, you ready?
Let's do it
Mmm, yeah, uhh
Yeah, uhh, c'mon

I'm the definition of, half man, half drugs
Ask the clubs, Bad Boy, that's whassup
After bucks, crush cruise after us
No gaze, we ain't laughin' much

Nothin' but big thangs, check the hit list
How we twist shit, what change but the name?
We still here, you rockin' wit the best
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks
(Ahh)

Who's the boss? Dudes is lost
Don't think 'cause I'm iced out, I'ma cool off
Who else but me? And if you don't feel me
(Who else?)
That mean you can't touch me, it's ugly, trust me

Get it right dawg, we ain't ever left
We just, moved in silence and rep to the death
(Yeah)
It's official, I survived what I been through
Y'all got drama, "The Saga Continues"

We ain't, go-in nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life
We ain't, go-in nowhere, we ain't, goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now 'cause it's Bad Boy for life

Aiyyo strait from the Harlem streets
I don't play, I push it down wit the Harlem Heat
(Uh-huh)
All a sudden niggaz got a problem wit me
