Ahhh
This ain't no love song girl
Wow wow wow
This is for the G's, the bedroom G's
If you wanna to take me home
You better make me moan and groan, (oh oh oh)
If you wanna to take me home
Your better make me groan and moan, (oh yeah, and moan)
If you need it, need it, need it
It's right here
All you have to do is ask
Have no fear
I will show, show you, show you, (Whoa)
What I can do (ooh ooh)
And if you still don't believe
That's cool,
You fool,
But you gotta wet me up and wet me down
