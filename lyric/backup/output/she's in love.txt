Third June, she said goodbye
I watched her walk into the night
The hardest thing I ever did
Was let her go

We sword as friends, we'd stay in touch
Best of friends didn't mean that much
When that phone call comes to tell you
She's in love

She's in love
She's got that fire in her eyes
She's in love
How her smile lights up the sky
It's like she's walking on air
She's been set free
Still I can't believe

She's in love
Strolling down a one-way street
