Ever since we've been together, 
You've been buggin' me about, 
Another woman.
Yes you have.

I'm gettin' sick and tired, 
Of bein' accused.
I'm gonna make it through, honey, 
Yes I am.

But when I come home from work, 
I can hardly, 
Close my eyes.

You keep buggin' me and naggin' me about, 
Some hearsay and jive.
Ohhh, yeah yeah... 

You've never seen me do nothin' wrong, 
When I get my check, 
I bring it home.
And you still run into me with that, 
He said, she said, you did it.
