"Uh. I mean I'm just sittin' right here.
Checking out this young lady right here.
Baby you hot.
I mean you sexy. Oh my god!
Let me ask you one question.
Where you from anyway?"

She's Miss California, hottest thing in west L.A.
House down by the water. Sails her yacht across the bay.
Drives a Maranello, Hollywood's her favorite scene.
Loves to be surrounded with superstars that know her name.

She's a rich girl, from the top of the food chain.
Love and material things, kinda lonely.
'Til I met her at the Grammys, 10mil on a diamond ring.
She invites me to spend a day on the jet skis.
At first it didn't mean a thing.
Then she told me I'm the one that she's searched for.
It was hard to believe.
