Money, money, cars, cars
Clothes, clothes, the hos
I suppose, yeah

I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hos I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Drizzy, ah yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel you
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothings realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much will kill ya

And when I leave, I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier

Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, ya hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD

Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Dis' me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any awards show or party I get fly for it
I know that it's comin' I just hope that I'm alive for it

I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hos I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
