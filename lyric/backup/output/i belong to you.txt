I belong to you
For as long as you want me to
I belong to you
For as long as you want me to

In love with you I'll always be
Forever true till you set me free
Please don't you worry
About all the guys around
They can't sweet talk me
They can't put you down

Ain't nothin' they can say
My darlin' ain't no way
