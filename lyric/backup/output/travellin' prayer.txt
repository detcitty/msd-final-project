Hey Lord, take a look all around
And I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
And things are gonna be alright with me

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that all her dreams are sweet
