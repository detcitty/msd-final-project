Hey little Porsche, I wanna try ya
Crazy baby girl, there ain’t nothing like you
Hey little Porsche, so right I had to get ya
B-b-back it up, let’s roll, roll, roll

Girl lets go
You sexy thing, you turn me on,
I need a private show, here on the lawn, in my garage
I think you on a row, hey Porsche girl
I think you know what I wanna do
Come on let me slide under so I can work on, work on you

I wanna take your top off, celebrate this champagne pop-off
Yeah, we could turn the clocks off
No rush, baby we could just park somewhere
I don’t need nobody’s permission
No keys, push start to ignition, say

Hey little Porsche, I wanna try ya
Crazy baby girl, there ain’t nothing like you
Hey little Porsche, so right I had to get ya
B-b-back it up, let’s roll, roll, roll, roll
