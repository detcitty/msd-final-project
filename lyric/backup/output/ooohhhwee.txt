Weebie! Holla at me (c'mon)
I got like twelve bottles of bubbly (oh)

I love the way she shake it in the thong - OOOHHHWEE!
The way she make it twurk and grab the wall - OOOHHHWEE!
Oh, baby you know whatchu doin - OOOHHHWEE!
No Limit got the steps bouncin and movin - OOOHHHWEE!

I know a big girl, with a ironed skirt
Give her couple dollars, she'll make it work
I mean holla at me whoadie, you know our crew large
Our fantasy's to have sex wit two broads
On a boat or a plane or exotic cars
Bring it to the next girl, bring the toys
On the dash, little shawty started takin it off
Took her to the V.I.P., started breakin me off
Said she knew I was a baller by my iced out wrists
I told her "Wait, it don't stop, keep drinkin the Cris'"
I'ma perky boy this, like to do the ass
See a fine chick, you know I'm gon' grab her
Nelly Nay girl where you at?
