I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time

At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles at the same damn time

Gucci made in Italy, Bally belt, I'm killing shit
The way I rock a Jimmy Choo's the word got out I'm dealing it
I fuck her, she an immigrant, don't touch her, she got benefits
Bussing down them Benjamin's

Fucking up my Louie kicks, that's the way I'm kicking it
Pharaoh garment cover me, Puerto Rican, Japanese
We laid up at the Double Tree
Yellow ice, a bumble bee, pinky ring, a quarter key

iPhone, a metro, twerking off the whole thing
My ear ring a jelly bean, gangsta lean and Irene
Red eyes no visine, I'm loc'd out on the bean
Horse shoes on my jeans

Robbing jeans with the wings
