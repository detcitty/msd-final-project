Little ditty bout jack and diane
Two American kids growin up in the heartland
Jacky's gonna be a football star
Diane debutante backseat of Jacky's car

Suckin' on chili dogs outside the tastee freeze
Diane's sittin' on Jacky's lap
He's got his hand between her knees
Jacky say Hey Diane lets run off
Behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks
