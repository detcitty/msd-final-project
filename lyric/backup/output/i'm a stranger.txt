Well Iâ? m a stranger here in this place called Earth
And I was sent down here to discover the worth
Of your little blue planet third from the sun
Come on and show me what youâ? ve done

We got the aeroplane, we got the automobile
We got sky scraper buildings made of glass and steel
Weâ? ve got synthetic food that nearly tastes real
And a little white pill that makes you feel hey
Hey, A whole lot better when you get out of bed
