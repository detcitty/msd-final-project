Summertime and the livings easy
Bradley's on the microphone with ras M.G
All the people in the dance will agree
that we're well qualified
to represent the lbc
me and louie
run to the party dance to the rhythm it gets harder.

Me and my girl
we got this relationship.
I love her so bad but she treats me like...
on lock down like a penitentiary.
she spreads her lovin' all over
and when she get home there's none left for me
