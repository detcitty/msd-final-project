Your Empty walls
Your Empty walls
Pretentious attention
Dismissive apprehension
Don't waste your time
On coffins today
When we decline
From the confines of our mind
Don't waste your time
On coffins today...

Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication
Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication
I want you to be left behind those empty walls

Taunt you to see from behind those empty walls...
