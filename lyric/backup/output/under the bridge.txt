Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
sometimes I feel like my only friend
is the city I live in, the city of angels
lonely as I am, together we cry
I drive on her streets cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am
she sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
I never worry, now that is a lie.
