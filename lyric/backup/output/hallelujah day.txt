Hallelujah day
Sing hallelujah
Love is on its way
It's coming to ya

Children gather 'round now
Clap your hands and sing
That old sun is shining down
Soon the bells are gonna ring (Yes they will now)

Can't you see that ray of hope
Somebody finally saw the light
They're gonna send our brothers home
It's gonna be all right, yeah
