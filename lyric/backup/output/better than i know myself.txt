Cold as ice
And more bitter than a December
Winter night
That's how I treated you

And I know that I
I sometimes tend to lose my temper
And I cross the line
Yeah, that's the truth

I know it gets hard sometimes
But I could never
Leave your side
No matter what I say

'Cause if I wanted to go, I would have gone by now
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
