God bless us every one
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
No

God bless us every one
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone

It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
No

And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light
(God bless us every one, we're a broken people living under loaded gun)
Oh, like memories in cold decay

Transmissions echoing away
