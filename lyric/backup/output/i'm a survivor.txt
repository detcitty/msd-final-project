I was born three months too early
The doctor gave me thirty days
But I must've had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace

I guess I'll keep on living
Even if this love's to die for
Cause your bags are packed
And I ain't crying
You're walkin out
And I'm not trying
To change your mind 'Cause I was born to be
