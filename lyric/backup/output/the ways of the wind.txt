P.M. Dawn - The Ways of the Wind

Holding on is like the ways of the wind,
Holding on is like the ways of the wind

I wore a ring that was taken so hastily,
Thinking naively that it guaranteed my safety
I'm looking at eyes that have stumbled across a shooting star
Saying that's alright, I know the kind of man you are

Holding on is like the ways of the wind,
Holding on is like the ways of the wind

How many things I recall I can't take too far
She's good at collecting
and counting on the things you are
Forever racing the flames she loved to put me through
I was never a good seahorse
But I can practice rides on you
Another world, another space,
