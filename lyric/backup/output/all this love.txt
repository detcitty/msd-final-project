I had some problems
And no one could seem to solve them
But you found the answer
You told me to take this chance

And learn the ways of love, my baby
And all that it has to offer
In time you will see
That love won't let you down

You said that you loved me
Said hurt only came to pass me
It sounded so convincing
That I gave it half a chance

And learned the ways of love, my baby
There is so much love inside me
And all that I have
I give my all to you

All, all my love, baby
And all this love is waiting for you
