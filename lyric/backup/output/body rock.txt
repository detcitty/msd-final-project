Born on a hungry street
Children of darkness grew up on the beat.
Anything in our way
We'll just move away.

I got the heart to win
You got the eyes that say that I can
We've gonna turn this town upside down tonight
They can't stop us now!

Body rock
Get your body in the music
Body rock comes from deep inside me
Body rock
Let your body talk to me tonight
