You've been wearing that crown and tearing me down
It's been a while since you've treated me right
You strung me along for far too long 'cause I never gave up the fight
Until now
It's gonna hit you hard till you see stars
It's gonna put through you a world of hurt
Oh, I don't believe in getting even but getting what you deserve
Oh my, oh my

Mama always told me that I should play nice
She didn't know you when she gave me that advice
I'm through, with you
You're one page I'd like to burn
Bottle up the ashes, smash the urn
I'm through with you, la ti da
