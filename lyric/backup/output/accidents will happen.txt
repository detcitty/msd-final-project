Oh, I just don't know where to begin
Love doesn't wait forever
It's now or never
But she keeps 'em hangin' on
You said you're so alone
She says she can't go home without a chaperon

Accidents will happen
They only hit and run
You used to be a victim now you're not the only one
Accidents will happen
