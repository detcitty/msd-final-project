The week was long but now it's gone, the drink is on
So fill your cup and turn the good time music on
And pick up that sweet somebody
Wrap your arms around this Friday night
And get a little lost in the party flow
Juke trouble like a champagne bubble sing
(Yeah-eah-eah-eah) yeah-eah-eah-eah
(Yeah-eah-eah-eah) yeah-eah-eah-eah

Two bottles of Bud, two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love just bumping the night
Two crazy hearts looking in the dark
