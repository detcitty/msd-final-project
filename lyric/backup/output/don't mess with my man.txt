Brian/Brandon Casey:
Uh, I like it baby (yeah)
Uh, one time for the club (ye-eah)
Two time for my thugs, uh-huh
Three times for my ladies, come on, come on, come on (ooh, oh)
Uh, Nivea y'all. Jagged Edge youall... (oooh)
Uh-uh, Jagged Edge you all

Nivea:
It was hard to find a brotha that was down for me
So I'm tellin' everybody let him be
Cuz he's mine and I can't take no pigeons tryna take my baby
So I thought I had to let you know
Find someone that you can call your own
Cuz now you're walkin' in the danger zone
And if I touch you I'll be wrong

Chorus:

If you mess with my man
I'ma be the one to bring it to ya
Got my girls, got my man
So find your own and leave mine alone
Don't mess with my man
I'ma be the one to bring it to ya
Here's a little advice for you, find your own man
