Natural love (natural love)
It's natural love (natural love)
Honey, you and I
Lying in the midnight sun

I say it's natural love (natural love)
It's natural love (natural love)
So hold me close
Our love has just begun

Oh, darling, it was good for me
I know it was good for you
We'll make the best
A little better tonight

A whispered word, a tender kiss
I tremble when we touch like this
