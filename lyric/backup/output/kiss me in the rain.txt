I remember sitting on the front steps
Feeling the softness of a warm summer rain
I see the reflections of my mind
All the sadness all the pain
Visions of yesterday,
How fast they slip away
And though my dreams have come and gone
With one wish I can say:
Kiss me in the rain, and make me feel like a child again
