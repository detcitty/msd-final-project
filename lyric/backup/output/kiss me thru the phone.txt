Soulja Boy Tell 'Em!

Baby you know that I miss you
I wanna get with you tonight but I cannot babygirl
And that's the issue
Girl you know I miss you
I just wanna kiss you
But I can't right now so baby kiss me thru the phone
(kiss me thru the phone)
I'll see you later on...
Kiss me thru the phone
(kiss me thru the phone)
See you when I get home

(Ayyyyyyyoooo!)
That Lil' Chico behind closed doors a Soulja baby
Just like Master P ain't no limit I thought I told you baby
Besitos Mami adonde tu quiera,
That means I'll give you kisses wherever you want them baby and drive you crazy.
Let me do the thangs you like, now baby close your eyes
And think with an open mind (whoo) Now fantasize.
