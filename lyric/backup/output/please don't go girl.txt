(We've been together for a long time baby)(Do you have to leave?)
Please don't go girl

(I just can't live without you)
Please, (so listen to me) don't go girl
Don't go girl

Please don't go girl
You would ruin my whole world
Tell me you'll stay
Never ever go away

I love you
(I love you)
I guess I always will
