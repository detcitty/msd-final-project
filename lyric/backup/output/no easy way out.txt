We're not indestructible
Baby, better get that straight
I think it's unbelievable
How you give into the hands of fate

Some things are worth fighting for
Some feelings never die
I'm not askin' for another chance
I just wanna know why

There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Givin' in can't be wrong

I don't wanna pacify you
