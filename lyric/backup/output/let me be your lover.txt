The first time I saw you, 
You Look so sweet
I Lost my breath, sweat
And got my heart skip the beat
I can't believe my eyes
Are so fine
I knew right there and there
I have to make girl mine

But when I'd tried to talk to her
She never look my way
I'd Start falling down?
And all the words that she say 
I know I get in love so wisdom help

With every?
To make you see
You belong right here next to me
