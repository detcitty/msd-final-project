May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

La la la la la
La la la la la

When my time is over, lying in my grave
Written on my tombstone, I want it to say
This man was a legend, a legend of his time
When he was at a party, the party never died
Hey, everybody's got a dream so what do you say
