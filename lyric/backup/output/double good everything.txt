It's paradise, paradise
It's ecstasy, ecstasy
It's awful nice, awful nice
Having you loving me

It's wonderful, wonderful
It's very true, very true
It's double good everything
Being loved by you

What'd I do to deserve this
Makes me stop and wonder
Who am I?
What would make you want to serve this
To just another ordinary guy

Twice as good as any feeling
I have ever known
To call my own
