Shot
Like an arrow through my heart
That's the pain I feel
I feel whenever we're apart
Not to say that I'm in love with you
But who's to say that I'm not
I just know that it feels wrong
When I'm away too long
It makes my body hot
So let me tell ya baby

I'll tell your mama, I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter, baby tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl who likes to be alone

I miss ya much (boy, oh, I, miss you much)
