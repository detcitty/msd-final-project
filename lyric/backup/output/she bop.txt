Well, I see 'em every night in tight blue jeans
In the pages of a Blueboy magazine

Hey, hey I've been thinking of a new sensation
I'm picking up good vibrations
Oop, she bop, she bop
Do I wanna go out with a lion's roar?

Yeah, I wanna go south and get me some more

Hey, they say that a stitch in time saves nine
They say I better stop or I'll go blind
Oop, she bop, she bop
