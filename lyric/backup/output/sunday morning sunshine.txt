I came into town with a knapsack on my shoulder
And a pocket full of stories that I just had to tell
You know I've knocked around a bit
And I've had my share of small town glories
It's time to hit the city and that crazy carousel

I been feeling sorry for myself
But you know I was only lonely
Like everybody else
