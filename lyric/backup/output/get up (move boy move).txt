Get up, get up

[CHORUS]
Get up
Come on, move your body
Get up
Come on, move your feet now
Get up
Move boy, move boy
Get up
Come on, move that body

It's a Friday night and
The groove is kicking
Where the girls are
Finger licking

I came to the club
Just to cool out
But this girl was
Getting buck wild

I really just wanted to dance
But she's grabbing me
By my pants
Said, you're cause you
Gotta get loose
