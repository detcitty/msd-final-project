I done came down, hold up

Grip the grain, Roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me

'Cuz I ain't trying to control her

She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline
H-Town so I'm made to lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man

I'm flying down your boulevard
She cooking dinner with your pants

Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
