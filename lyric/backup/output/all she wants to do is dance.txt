They're pickin' up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

Rebels been rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance

Molotov cocktail the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance

Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance
