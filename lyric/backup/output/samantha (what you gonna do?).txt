Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
What you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh

The ticking of the clock is the countdown

Samantha rises
Puts her school clothes on
Her doctor, doctor
Is the only one in town
Rumors like this
Are gonna spill all around

Love, love, love, love's power
She carries you with love so dear
Love, love, love, love's power
So tiny, it would drown in a tear

Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do, oh
