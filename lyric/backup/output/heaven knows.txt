Baby please
Please don't take your love from me
I am yours forever more
Until eternity

Silently
Listen to the words I say
Well I'm not talking just for play
Listen to me, please

Heaven knows
It's not the way it should be
And heaven knows
It's not the way it could be
Don't you know there's no need to leave
