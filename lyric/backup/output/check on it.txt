You need to stop playing round with all them clowns and the wanksters
Good girls gotta get down with them gangstas
Go head girl put some back and some neck up on it
While I stand up in the background and check up on it

Ohh boy you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over check up on it, I'm gonna let you work up on it
Ladies let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

If you got flaunt it, boy I know you want it
While I turn around you watch me check up on it
Ooh you watchin' me shake it, I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it, it's blazin', you rock me it amaze me
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it
If you don't go braggin', I'ma let you have it
You think that I'm teasin' but I ain't got no reason
I'm sure that I can please ya but first I gotta read you

Ohh boy you looking like you like what you see
