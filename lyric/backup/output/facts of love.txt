Passion... Passion... Passion...
These are the facts of love
These are the facts of love... Passion...

You heard about my reputation
You might think that I'm as cold as ice
But if you know the secret
I'm not so hard to satisfy...
I'll accept no imitations
Men who play those games with foolish lies
'Cos they? re a dime a dozen
I've got something else in mind

[[PRE-CHORUS]]
I need more than empty conversation
Only takes me half the way
