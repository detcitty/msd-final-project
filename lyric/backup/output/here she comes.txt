She begins to steal the light
Confusion throws another mystery
It's out of focus with the eyes
So now you wonder, is this just a dream?

Here she comes, here she comes
She's gonna 'cause a sensation now
And just between you and me
I think she'll soon have you temptation bound

Suppose, who knows? She's not above suspicion
Is she? Maybe, on some kind of secret mission
