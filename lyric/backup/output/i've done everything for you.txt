This one way love affair ain't fair
It ain't no fair to me
It's all give and take and you just take
And I can't take it you see
Well, I'm givin' up on love this time
Me and my friends will do just fine

I've done everything for you
You've done nothin' for me
I've done everything for you
You've done nothin' for me

You said someday I'd have a whole lot of money
I'd be a millionaire
But when that didn't happen overnight
