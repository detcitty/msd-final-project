What's somebody like you, doing in a place like this?
Say did you come alone, or did you bring all your friends?
Say what's your name, what you drinkin,
I think I know what you're thinking.

Baby what's your sign?
Tell me yours, I'll tell you mine.
Say what's somebody like you, doing in a place like this?
(1, 2, 3, come on!)

I'll never be the same (if we ever meet again)
Won't let you get away (say if we ever meet again)
This freefall (ahh), got me so (ohh), kiss me all night
Don't ever let me go.
