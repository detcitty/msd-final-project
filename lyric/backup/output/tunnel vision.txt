Gleeee!
Southside

Aye, Lil Metro on that beat

Lil Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me: "Boy, make a decision!"
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me: "Boy, make a decision!"

Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision

They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions
