Maybe I need some rehab
Oh, maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams

I'm looking down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hittin' my head against the wall

What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
