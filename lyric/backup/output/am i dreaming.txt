Am I dreamin' baby?
Are you for real?

Things are kind of hazy
And my head's all cloudy inside
(Inside)
Now I've heard talk of angels, baby
But never thought I would have one to call mine
(Never thought)

See you are, just too good to be true
And I hope
There's not some kinda mirage
With you, oh baby

Am I dreamin'?
(Am I dreamin'?)
Am I just imagining, you're here in my life?
