I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street.

Now did you read the news today
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
Burning into the night.

There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion.

Ooh this is the world we live in
(Oh-oh-oh)
And these are the hands we're given
(Oh-oh-oh)
Use them and let's start trying
