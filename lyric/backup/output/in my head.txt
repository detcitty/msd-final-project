C'mon

Everybody's lookin' for love.(Ooh, oh)
Ain't that the reason,
You're at this club?(Ooh, oh)
You ain't gon' find it,
Dancin' with him. No, oh
I got a better solution,
For you girl, (Ooh, oh)

Just leave with me now,
Say the word and we'll go.(And we'll go)
I'll be your teacher,
I'll show you the ropes. (You the ropes)
You'll see a side of love,
You've never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head, I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
My head
You'll be screaming no.
