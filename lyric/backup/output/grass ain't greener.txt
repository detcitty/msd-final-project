You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
But you never fuck with none of them
Girl you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl it's not fair

You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
