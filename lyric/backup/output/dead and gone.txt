Hey, Let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing, I'm sure you feel the same way.
Big Phil
This for you pimpin'.

Ohhhh (hey)
I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is Dead & Gone, Dead & Gone
Ohhhh (hey)

The old me is Dead & Gone, Dead & Gone, Dead...

Ever had one of them days you wish you would've stayed home?
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on
You walk by
They get wrong
You reply then shit get blown
Way outta proportion
Way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you get your hair that's next
So they don't wanna stop there now they bustin'
Now you gushin' ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you're hit 4 times
Bullet hit your spine
Paralyzed waist down now your wheelchair bound
Never mind that now you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday
All over bullshit dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
