I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I've finally found a man that's true

I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heart it would not subside
I felt like dying until you saved my life

Thank God I found you, I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight, completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude 'cause baby, I'm so thankful I found you
