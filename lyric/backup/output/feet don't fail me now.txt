Can't you see, she don't want you around no more
Can't you see, that her hand's pointing at the door
Feet don't fail me now
How could anyone stay
Anyone could see it's time to go away
Time to take a powder
Open up your eyes
But it feels like my legs have been paralyzed

Feet don't fail me now
Begging please don't make a fool of me
Feet don't fail me now
Please don't keep me where I should not be
