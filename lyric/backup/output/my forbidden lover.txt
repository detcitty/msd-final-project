My forbidden lover, I don't want no other
My forbidden lover, I don't want no other

I fell in love and I didn't want to do it
'Cause I knew that your love wasn't true
You try to hide that sinister appearance
And the lies whew, those alibis

You give your love to anyone who asks
Yes you do and I know that it's true
But still I care and I want to see you there
