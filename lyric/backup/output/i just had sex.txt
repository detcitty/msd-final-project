Sometimes (Oh-oh-ohhh)
Something beautiful happens in this world (Akon!)
You don't know how to express yourself, so (And Lonely Island!)

You just gotta sing
I just had sex (Ay)
And it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her (Her)

I just had se-ay-ee-ex
And I'll never go back (Never go back)
To the not-havin'-sex ways of the past
Have you ever had sex? I have, it felt great (Yeah)

It felt so good when I did it with my penis (Yeah)
A girl let me do it, it literally just happened
