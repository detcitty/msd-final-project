Oh, I never thought you'd hurt me, I guess you live and learn
That when you're playin' with fire, you're bound to get burned
Oh, I've been mistreated, I've been used before
I get kicked in the face still I come back for more
But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain

We can pick up the pieces and start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl I can't take anymore
Baby, don't treat me bad

This could be the best thing that you'll ever have
