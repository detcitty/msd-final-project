I need a saving grace
A hiding place
I don't have forever or time to waste
So don't let me be lonely

I wanna shake this winter coat off my sleeve
Dust off a record and just be free
Oh don't let me be lonely
No don't let me be lonely

When you're young
You can fly
But we trip on clouds 'cause we get too high
We grow up
And then it's gone
