Rock, then bend my knees, everytime tha beat drop
Rock, then bend my knees, everytime tha beat drop

You know pimpin' make tha beat drop, and with a laptop
I make 'em do it, do it as soon as the beat drop
Might throw my towels out like Nick, I like to wyle out
I'ma stay in the game until I fall out

First I lean, grab a ball and then I pop wit it
When they bring the mics, the crowd, I rock wit it
And licks, tryin' to get it quick
When the songs come on, they like, “That's my ****”

I can't help who I'm is, when they play my shh
I just love to dance everytime tha beat drop
I love to wyle out, damn right, shake it all night
Hey, that's my jam everytime tha beat drop

I said ooh, all the ladies in the club grab a dude
And you work it real slow, you can do it
Move it 'til you make him lose it
He gon' be a fan everytime tha beat drop

I know you used to seein' Mo laid back
So for the most part, you think I'm like that
