Baby, I got myself together
I'm ready, willing?

And there's no time
(No time, no time, no time)
For foolish little things
I've left behind

Now I get high on just the thought
Of making love with you

The electronic magnetism of your love
Takes me straight up to the sky
(That's heavy, baby)

All my life
