Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Well, something on the surface it stinks

Well, something on the surface
It kind of makes me nervous
To say that you deserve this
And what kind of God would serve this
We will cure this dirty old disease

Well, if you you've got the poison, I've got the remedy
The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words

I said, the tragedy is that you're going to spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well, it all amounts to nothing in the end
