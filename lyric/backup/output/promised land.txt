Aw, get on it

I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound and rode him into Raleigh
And on across Caroline

We had motor trouble that turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
Well, that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

Right away I bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
