Yah, it do not matter
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster
Turned to a savage, pocket got fatter, she call me daddy
Smokin' that gas, gone off that Xanny, she on the powder
Nowadays I am on, my haters got sadder
Money got longer, speaker got louder, car got faster

Money so old that it's spoiled
Yah, my lil' bitch so spoiled
Yah, I rub her down in oil
Yah, I got money, now you know it, yah
Diamonds on my teeth
