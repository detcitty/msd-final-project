MasterMinds! We gon' get this forever
You know whenever we link up, my nigga
They think this shit comes from outer space or something
Nigga, let's get this money nigga
Masterminds, R-O-C, double M-G!
Jay, I got it, I got it

Four stacks for the heels on my bitch feet
Car seats still smelling like 10 ki's
Tell the plug that I'm lookin' for an increase
Wingstop, fat boy need a 10 piece
Say a nigga name and the car start
Nigga switching lane to lane like Wal-Mart
Sippin Bordeaux out in Bordeaux
Hazard lights flashing on the four-door
Switch the Benzo for the Enzo
Back to the Benzo when the ends low
Switch my old bitch for my new bitch
Cause my new bitch something like a nympho
Fuck the game raw when I came in it
Getting money ever since I came in it
You couldn't stop me if you tried
Motherfucker cause the devil is a lie

Big guns and big whips
Rich nigga talkin' big shit
Double cup, gold wrist
Double up on that blow, bitch!
Two mil on that I-95
Bow your head cuz it's time to pay tithes
Opposition want me dead or alive
Motherfucker but the devil is a lie
