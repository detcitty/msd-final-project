Just girl to boy
I'd like to share this thought with you
Our love's a joy
Two one's have made inseparable two

Last night my heart spoke to me
And it said, "You've found that lover-friend"
So now I've finally got the courage
Just ask you baby ooh

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you
Will you marry me?

Will you, will you
Will you marry me, boy?
Will you, will you, will you, will you
Come on baby now

I lay awake
So full with hope of things to come
For heaven's sake
I pray I'm not the only one

I never dreamed I'd be so bold
