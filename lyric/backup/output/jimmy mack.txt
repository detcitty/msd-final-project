Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
My arms are missin' you
My lips feel the same way too
I've tried so hard to be true
Like I promised I'd do
But this boy keep's a comin' 'round
He's tryin' to wear my resistance down
Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
