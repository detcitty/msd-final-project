Featuring Elisa Fiorillo

How come you can't explain it,
The way you're acting recently?
It seems that everything is changing,
Cause I can tell the way you're treating me.
I believe that you still love me,
But you find it hard to show.
Don't throw away the chance,
Cause it might be your last,
And I wont let you forget
Who, who found who?

Who,
Who found who?
Look at all the time youve wasted
And how your life is just a mess.
I took you home to meet my family;
It wasn't meant to be a test.
I wanted you to see devotion,
