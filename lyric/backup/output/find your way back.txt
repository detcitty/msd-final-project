You know, it's been a long, long road
Since I packed up and left on my own
And I carry a heavy load
Just trying get back to her heart

I sure ain't got no home
I seem to find love where I ramble
And when it's time to go
I hear that voice again, saying

Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart
Find your way back
