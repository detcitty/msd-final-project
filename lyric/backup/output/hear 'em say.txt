And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, like Tim, it's a hard-a-way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go, get a job today

Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the governments administer aids
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allah-u Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours

But these niggaz from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars with seein' cop cars
