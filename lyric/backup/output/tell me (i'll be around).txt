Yeah, come on, Motown
Girls, help me sing it

Tell me your name
('Cuz I wanna know)
What car do you drive?
(And tell me where can we go)
How much money do you make
(How can I be down)
As long as you have
(I'll be around)

Tell me your name
('Cuz I wanna know)
What car do you drive?
(And tell me where can we go)
How much money do you make
(How can I be down)
As long as you have
(I'll be around)

Most guys they come a dime a dozen
And they always try to get wit me
Don't think that I'm an opportunist
I fall in love but just not for free, so baby tell me

Tell me your name
('Cuz I wanna know)
What car do you drive?
(And tell me where can we go)
