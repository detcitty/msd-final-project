Chris Brown:
All that bullshit is for the birds
You ain't nothin but a vulture
Always hopin for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free
Ohohohohohohohoh (deuces)
Ohohohohohohohoh
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
Ohohohohohohohoh
I know you mad but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now im bout to throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
Made me wanna say bye bye
