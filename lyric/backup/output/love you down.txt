Oh...

It never really mattered too much to me
That you were just too damned old for me
All that really mattered was you were my girlfriend
And, baby, that's all that mattered to me

Let me love you down
Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
You know it's gonna be so right

Remember when I drove you home from work
I loved the way when you kissed me bye
All your friends think I'm just too young for you
You tell 'em that I can do what guys their age can do, oh, baby

Let me love you down
Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
You know it's got to be so right

Let me love you down
