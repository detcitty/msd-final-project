album: For God's Sake Give More Power To The People (1971)

There's something that I want to give you

I'm gonna give you a five pound box of love
With a million dollar bill on top (Million dollar bill on top)
Diamonds on every corner
And a big black pearl for a lock

Use my heart for a key
I want to pay you back (I want to pay you back)
I want to pay you back for loving me
Pay you back for loving me

Gonna give you a cloud of love to sleep on (I want to pay you back)
