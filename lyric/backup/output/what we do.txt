Man if I get rocked, this shit for my kids nigga
It's that real shit

*Even though what we do is wrong...*

We still hustle 'til the sun come up
Crack a 40 when the sun go down
It's a cold winter
Y'all niggas better bundle up
And I bet it be a hotter summer, grab a onion
Just to rock it down; you hot now, listen up:
Don't you know cops' sole purpose is to lock us down?
And throw away the key
But without this drug shit your kids ain't got no way to eat, huh
We still try to keep Mom... smilin'
Cuz when the teeth stop showin' and the stomach start growlin'
Then the heat start flowin'
If you from the hood I know you feel me (Jay-Z: Keep goin'...)
If a sneak start leaning and the heat stop workin'
Then my heat start working I'm a rob me a person
Catch a nigga sleeping while he out in the open... and I'm-a get him (Jay-Z: Keep flowin'...)
