I bet you never heard ol' Marshall Dillon say
"Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of runnin' away?
And settling' down, would you marry me?
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?"

Lord, she'd have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot
His heart wasn't in it, he just stole a kiss and he rode away
He never hung his brim up at Kitty's place

Shoulda been a cowboy, should've learned to rope and ride
Wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
Stealin' a young girl's heart, yes, like Gene and Roy
Sang a few rodeo songs, yeah, I should've been a cowboy
