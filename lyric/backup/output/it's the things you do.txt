(It's the things you do)

You touched my love line
So deep inside I
Never thought I'd feel so good
Oh no
No need to hide now
Open up your mind now
Let me make it understood
Because

Bridge:
Cos nobody ever said to me
All of the things we shared within
Now that I know that you can see
Let me feel you up

Chorus:
It's the things you do
