Yeah, I wear my chain to the game
But for the game I sip champagne from the world cup
Oh yeah, I'm here to stir shit up

I pray on a hill in Brazil
To Christ the Redeemer
But most kids worship us
(Ah!)

I'm just warming up
I'm almost ready
Turn it up a bit more in the headphones

Check me out though, look
It's cops to dodge in the city of God
