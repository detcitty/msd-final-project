I don't know what he does to make you cry
But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you, I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
