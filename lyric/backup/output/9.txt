Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city
This shit ain't gonna stop
It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets any better

Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than 'em telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
