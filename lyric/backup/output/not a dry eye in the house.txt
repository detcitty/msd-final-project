Not a dry eye in the house
after love's curtain comes down
Listen and you'll hear the sound, hear the sound of a heart breaking
I can still see you standin' there, midnight wind blowin' through your hair
Remember kisses sweet in the salty air, when love was forever
Turn the page and we fade to blue
Scene has changed now I'm without you
Well you just walked away when the act was through
And the dream was over
It was almost like a movie - the way you said goodbye
You must have spent a lot of time rehearsing each and every line
