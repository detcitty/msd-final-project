If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you

You'll never know what went well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you

I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but life keeps moving

Now take it in but don't look down

‘Cause I'm on top of the world, ‘ay
I'm on top of the world, ‘ay
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, ‘ay
