Close the door
Let me give you what you've been waiting for
Baby I got so much love to give
And I wanna give it all... to you...
Close the door
No need to worry no more
Let's bring this day to a pleasant end
Girl it's me... and you now...
I waited all day long
Just to hold you in my arms
And it's exactly like I thought it would be
Me loving you and you loving me...
Close the door
Let me rub your back where you say it's sore
