Mmm!
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Oooh-OOOH!

Shake ya ass
But watch yourself
Shake ya ass
Show me what you workin with
Shake ya ass
But watch yourself
Shake ya ass

I came here with my dick in my hand
Don't make me leave here with my foot in yo' ass; be cool
And don't worry bout how I'm rippin this shit
When I'm flippin what I'm kickin nigga, that's just what I do
I'm effervesecet and I'm off that crescent
Nastier than a full grown German Shepherd; motherfucker keep steppin
They don't fuck with me and they don't
Y'all bitches cant catch me and you won't
Pay ya fare, fix ya hair, throw that pussy
Got a Prada for boonapalist, and Donna for my babooski
You think I'm trickin? Bitch, I ain't trippin
I'm buyin if you got nice curves for your iceberg
Drinkin Henn and actin like it do somethin to me
Hope this indecent proposal make you do somethin with me
Fuck a dollar girl, pick up fifty
And fuck that coward you need a real nigga
Off top knick-a-boxers hurtin shit
Bend over hoe; show me what you workin with!

Shake ya ass
But watch yourself
Shake ya ass
Show me what you workin with

Attention all y'all players and pimps
Right now in the place to be (shake ya ass)
I thought I told y'all niggas before
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (watch yourself)
Now this ain't for no small booties
