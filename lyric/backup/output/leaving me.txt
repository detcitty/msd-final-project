Oh, darling
After all this time
You seem to me, girl
To be changing your mind

We don't talk no more
Like we used to do
What in the world
Has come over you

(Leaving me) oh, baby
(Can't be) tell me
(What you're telling me)
I wanna know (baby)

I heard somebody say
(Leaving me can't be)
You want your clothes back
(What you're telling me)
I want you to know (baby)

Lately, I felt that you
