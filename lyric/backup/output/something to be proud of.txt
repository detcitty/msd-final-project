There's a story that my daddy tells religiously,
Like clockwork every time he see's an opening,
In a conversation, 'bout the way things use to be.

I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door,
I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor,
Hanging onto every word; man, the things I heard

It was harder times and longer days,
Five miles to school uphill both ways,
We were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor,
Course that was back before the war,
Yea your uncle and I made quit a pair,
Flying F-15's through hostile air,
He went down but they missed me by a hair,
He'd always stop right there and say,

That's something to be proud of,
