She got out of town
On a railway, New York bound
Took all except my name
Another alien on Broadway
Some things in this world you just can't change
Some things you can't see until it gets too late

Baby, baby, baby
When all your love is gone
Who will save me
From all I'm up against out in this world

Maybe, maybe, maybe
You'll find something that's enough to keep you
But if the bright lights don't receive you
