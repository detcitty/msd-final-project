I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then you come on with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
Your girl just kissed a girl
I do bi chicks
Shake for a sheik
I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spending this As-salam alaykum
Peace to M.O.N.E.Y.
I love my beaches, south beaches
Surfboard in high tide
I could just roll up
Cause I'm swole up
So that birthday cake get the cobra
