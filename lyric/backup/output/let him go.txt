You're holding him so tight
That he can't move
If you never give him room
You're gonna lose

He's feeling like he's
Tied up in a knot
Every time he comes home late
He's on the spot

Trust him to be
The kind of man he wants to be
You aren't gonna keep him long
If you give him the third degree

Let him go, let him go
Do the things he's got to do
