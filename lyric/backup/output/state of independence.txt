State of life, may I live, may I love
Coming out the sky, I name me a name
Coming out silver word for what it is
It is very nature of the sound, the game

Shablamidi, shablamida
Shablamidi, shablamida
Shablamidi, shablamida

Shablimidi, shablamida
Shablimidi, shablamida
Shablimidi, shablamida

Shot to the soul the flame of oroladian
Essence of the word
The state of independence
