Drop down and get your eagle on girl (flap your wings)
Drop down and get your eagle on girl (flap your wings)
Hell naw, ain't leavin me alone girl (flap your wings)
Drop down and get your eagle on girl (flap your wings)
Drop down and get your eagle on girl (flap your wings)
Drop down and get your eagle on girl (flap your wings)
Hell naw, ain't leavin me alone girl (flap your wings)
Drop down and get your eagle on girl
She's got that sweat drippin all over her body

(Girl)
Do you like that sweat drippin all over my body?

(Nelly)
Yea, I like that
That sweat drippin' all over your body

(Girl)
You like that sweat drippin all over my body

(Nelly)
It's summertime, and I'm back again
And went to VA, oh, got my friends
Say what's up, Pharrell

(Pharrell)
Look whats on the nail

Yeah but, let's show 'em what's above the nail, bling
A hundred thou couldn't get you one of these (Not one of these)
I guarantee it ain't a flaw on one of these (One of these)
Two hundred thou, couldn't get you in the league
Get three hundred thou, you couldn't even buy the keys
I think you need to add 50 more G's
Now, shall I proceed?

(Ladies)
Yes, indeed (Ho)

I need to see you take it down to the floor
Spread your wings, if you real ma, fly real low
Pause for a second ma, grind real slow
And if you do it right
All day we'll go (Ho)
I talk a lil' Fred Seigal girl (Seigal, girl)
Bonnie and Judy Lee with your bag all beaded, girl
Apple bottom pair underneath it
You talkin like you don't need it
I can tell you see it
I like that in you
