I got a lot to say to you
Yeah, I've got a lot to say
I notice your eyes are always glued to me
Keeping them here
And it makes no sense at all

They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
You little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
You little spies

Crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush
(Two, three, four)
Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone

Just the one, two
I was just counting on
That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
