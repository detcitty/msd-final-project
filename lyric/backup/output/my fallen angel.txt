Rising high, in the morning and the night
Feeling low, never knowing where you'll fall
Hypnotized, nothing can make you feel this way
No way out, cause now your trapped and can't go back
Why couldn't you come to me
Knowing I'll be there for you
Is love so strong why can't you turn around
And look for me my baby
