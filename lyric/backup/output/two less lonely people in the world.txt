I was down, my dreams were wearing thin
When you're lost, where do you begin?
My heart always seemed to drift from day to day
Looking for the love that never came my way

Then you smiled and I reached out to you
I could tell you were lonely too
One look, then it all began for you and me
The moment that we touched, I knew that there would be

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
