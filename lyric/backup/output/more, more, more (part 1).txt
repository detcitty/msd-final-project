Ooh, how do you like your love?
Ooh, how do you like your love?

But if you want to know how I really feel
Get the cameras rollin', get the action goin'
Baby, you know, my love for you is real
Take me where you want to never guard your steal

More, more, more
How do you like it?
How do you like it?
How do you like it?
How do you like it?
How do you like it?
How do you like it?

Ooh, how do you like your love?
Ooh, how do you like your love?

But if you want to know how I really feel
Just get the cameras rollin', get the action goin'
