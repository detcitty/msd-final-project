Well, the times are gettin' hard for you little girl
I'm a-hummin' and a-strummin' all over God's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock 'n' roll was
Until you met my drummer on a gray tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line, yeah

Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
The heater don't work and it's oh so cold
