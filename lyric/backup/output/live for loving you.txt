Ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Lyin' awake, I turn to you
You are softly sleeping
I think of what I'd like to do
While you are somewhere dreaming
I, I feel so happy by your side
Oh why, I wonder, wonder, wonder why

Find it hard to find the words
To say what I am feeling
I'm so in love, I'm so alive
And I know you're the reason why
Why, I'm so happy all the time?
Oh why, I wonder, wonder, wonder why?
