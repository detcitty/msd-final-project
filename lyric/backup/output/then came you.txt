Ever since I met ya, seems I can't forgetcha
The thought of you keeps runnin' through the back of my mind
Every time I'm near ya, I get that urge to feel ya
Just touchin' you and lovin' you makes ev'rything right
(Tell me how ya feel, baby)
I never knew love before (oh no) then came you, you, then came you
