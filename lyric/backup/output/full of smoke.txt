I'm the man today
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
Got a hold on life
I'm takin' each day by day being strong
Know just where I'm going to

As I get higher and higher
Dreams grow, visions flow by
This is as good as it gets
As I take another hit, suga
I can't stop, I won't stop

'Cuz I'm too cool
And what they say is true
Ooh, I'm full of smoke
'Cuz I'm too cool
And what they say is true
Ooh, I'm full of smoke
