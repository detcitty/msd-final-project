1: Treach

My thoughts are thundering, tumblin
Sons of bitches, switches, from yelling ta mumbling
You ain't a pal of me, my family ties but not wit Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary, as I roll reality thru galaxies
Four centuries, it's sent to me with the scent of oiu
Witta chain representing penitentiaries
from Roman town to Borentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
lifers, Rikers ta foesome
Wasn't driving to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening to slow
I'm abrupting construction, a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin 'bout an obstruction or turning something of nothing
From more things to more things, it's the rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking ta hump Ms. Junk in the trunk, pump pumpin me up

Jersey niggas are the craziest
New York niggas are the craziest
DC niggas are the craziest
Philly niggas are the craziest
LA niggas are the craziest
