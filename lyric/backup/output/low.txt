Sometimes you wanna take you down
Sometimes I wanna get you low
Brush your hair back from your eyes
Take you down let the river flow

Sometimes I go and walk the street
Behind the green sheet of glass
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles

I'll be with you girl
Like being low
Hey hey hey like being stone

I'll be with you girl
