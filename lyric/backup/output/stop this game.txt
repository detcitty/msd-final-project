Well, I can't stop the music
I could stop it before
Now I don't want to hear it
Don't wanna hear it no more, no more

I can't stop the music
I could stop it before
Now I don't wanna hear it
Don't wanna hear it no more

All I wanna do is stop this game
It's gonna really end
Stop this game
It's such a touchy, touchy thing

Hey, livin' with you
