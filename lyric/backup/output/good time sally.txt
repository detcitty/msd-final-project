When I first came to the city
I had a twenty dollar bill in my jeans
And I thought that I must be in heaven
'Cause I found the little girl of my dreams

I was just new in the city now
And she was so young and pretty now
She showed me a brand new world
Oh Sally, Sally was a good time girl

Well, I showed her all of my money
And she showed me a real good time
