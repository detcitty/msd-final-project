I miss the words we used to say
I miss the sounds of yesterday
I miss the games we used to play like ohhh
I was trapped inside a dream
I couldn't see her next to me
I didn't know she'd set me free like ohhh

Something happens when I hold her
She keeps my heart from getting older
When the days get short and the nights get a little bit colder
We hold each other
We hold each other
We hold each other, mmm

Everything looks different now
