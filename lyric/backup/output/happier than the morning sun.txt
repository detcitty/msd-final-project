Bom bom bom, I love you
I'm happier than the morning sun

And that's the way
You said that it would be
If I should ever bring you
Inside my life

I'm happier than the morning sun
That's the way
You said that it would be
If I should ever bring you
Inside my life

All my life I was alone
Didn't think I'd find my part
But now I see there's joy
Inside your arms

Every day I searched for the star
