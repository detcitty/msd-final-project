Yesterday I swore
I was gonna switch you
But today I'm back for more, oooh
I can't resist you
Starvin just to feed the feel
But lust just to make a deal
Will power disappears
You become the music in my ears

I want you tonight
I feel like getting crazy
Oh, I know it's not right
But who is gonna save me?
