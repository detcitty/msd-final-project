Ooh, baby, baby, baby
Whoa... oh...
My, my, my, my baby, yeah, girl
Oh, I love you, baby
Ooh, yes, I, yes, I do, girl

I love you in the night
I'm gonna take it real, real slow (Ooh, my baby)
I understand what you told me
And if I didn't know

I always wanted someone just like you
I really to hold you
I'd give the world to you, oh, my darlin'
You know I will, yeah, yeah, you know I will, I surely will

I will never do anything to hurt you (I wouldn't do one single thing to you, babe)
