I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh all my friends are turning green
You're the magicians assistant in their dreams.
Awooo
Awooo
And they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you, when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause

You're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think you'll like
