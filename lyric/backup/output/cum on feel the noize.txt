Baby baby baby!
Ee-ow...

So you think I got an evil mind, well I'll tell you honey
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
So you think my singing's out of time, well it makes me money
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Anymore
Oh no

So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We get wild, wild, wild,
We get wild, wild, wild,
So cum on feel the noize
Girls grab the boys
We get wild, wild, wild,
At your door
