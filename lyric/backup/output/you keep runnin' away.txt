I hear your high-heels clickin' down the boulevard
You got your suitcase in hand, guess you're takin' it hard
You swear you'll never trust another man
Ah, but I know that you will, it's just a question of when

So open up your eyes to the light
You've been far too alone for too many nights, oh
Someday, someway, somewhere, love is gonna find you
Somehow, someone is gonna beg you to stay
But you keep on runnin', you keep runnin'
You keep on runnin' away
