Go!

It's one, two, three
Take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine

I say you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine

Oh, four, five, six
C'mon and get your kicks
Now you don't need that money
When you look like that, do ya, honey?

Big black boots
Long brown hair
