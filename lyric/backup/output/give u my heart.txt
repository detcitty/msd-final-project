Your love's so exciting
Boy I can't deny it
Since you found a place in my heart
Givin' me a feeling
Ooh it's such a feeling
I pray that we never will part
How can I explain it?
Please hear what I'm sayin'
You bring so much joy to my life
Words cannot express
So much happiness
I'll forever be by your side
And I will give you my heart
And I will always be true to you
And I will love you forever
