The tide is high, but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind of girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh nooooooooo...
The tide is high, but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
Number one

It's not the things you do
That tease me and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do
The things you do to me
