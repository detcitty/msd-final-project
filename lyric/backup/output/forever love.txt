Now here we are, The two of us,
And nothing's gonna come between us again.
Forever love, I feel you're with me,
YouæŠ®e the sun that chases away the rain. Oh...
I cherish all the love you bring,
It's here forever and a day,
I love you more than anything,
I can't throw that away. My Love...

There's nowhere, Baby unless you're there,
I could never let you down.
By the way, I have wanted to say,
I will always be around, Forever love. Oh. Forever Love, baby oh...
Inside my heart, You'll never die,
You understand the man that hides deep inside.
