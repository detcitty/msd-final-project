Here's a little song I wrote you might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry be happy
In every life we have some trouble but when you worry you make it double
Don't worry be happy
Don't worry be happy now
Ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh...

Don't worry
Woo ooh-woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh...
Be happy
Woo ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Don't worry be happy
Ooh-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh hoo-hoo-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh...

Don't worry
Woo ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Be happy
Woo-ooh-woo-ooh-ooh...
Don't worry be happy
