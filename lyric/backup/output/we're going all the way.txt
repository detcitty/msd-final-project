We're just beginning
And I know we've each been down this road a time or two
And never could make it through
But I've got this feelin'
That we've stumbled in to what we've both been waiting for
And maybe even more
It doesn't matter where we've been 'cause this time I know for sure

We're goin' all the way (All the way)
Headed for forever and that's where we're gonna stay
The more you're near me, the more I know it
We got it all here if we just don't blow it
