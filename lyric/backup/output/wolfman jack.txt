"hey baby, you're on a subliminal trip to nowhere.you better get your trip
Together before you step in here with us!"

Full moon tonight, everything's all right
Baby come on back to Wolfman Jack (Wolfman Jack)
If you want yourself a day man, well I don't mind
You just ditch him when the sun goes down
'Cause the moon shines bright
And everything's all right
