Come, they told me
pa rum pum pum pum
Our new born king to see
pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring
pa rum pum pum pum

To lay before the king
pa rum pum pum pum
ra pum pum pum
ra pum pum pum

Ra pum pum pum
ra pum pum pum pum pum
yeah I'm on the drum
yeah I'm on the snare drum

yeah I'm on the beat cause the beat goes dumb
and they only spare heat cause I'm playing for the sun
playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm suprised you didn't hear this in the bible
I'm so tight I might go phsyco
Christmas time so heres a recital

I'm so bad like Michael I know
