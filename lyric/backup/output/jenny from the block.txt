Children growing and women producing
Men go work and some do stealing
Everyone's got to make a living

LOX yeah, J Lo yeah
Yeah yo, yo

We off the blocks this year

Went from a low to a lot this year
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
I know where I'm goin' and I know where I'm from
You hear LOX in your ear

Yeah we're at the airport out
D block from the block
Where everybody air forced out
With a new white tee you fresh
Nothin' phony with us make the money
Get the mansion bring the homies with us

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (from the Bronx)

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
