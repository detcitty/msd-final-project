And the winner is Hov, my man! 
Speech!

First of all I wanna thank my connect
The most important person, with all due respect
Thanks to the duffle bag, the brown paper bag
The Nike shoe box for holding all this cash
Boys in blue who put green before the badge
The first pusher who ever made the stash
The Roc Boys in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling I'm feeling life
Thanks to the lames, niggas with bad aim
Thanks to a little change I tore you out the game
Bullet wounds will stop your buffoonery
Thanks to the pastor rapping at your eulogy
To Lil Kim and them, you know the women friend
Who carry the work cross state for a gentlemen
Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers
And most importantly you: the customer


The Roc Boys in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling, I'm feeling life
You don't even gotta bring your paper out
We the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house
(We in the house, house)
The Roc Boys in the building tonight
Look at how I'm chilling, I'm killing this ice
You don't even gotta bring ya purses out
