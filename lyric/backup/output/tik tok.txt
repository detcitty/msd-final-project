Wake up in the mornin' feeling like P. Diddy (Hey, what up, girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go!)
Before I leave, brush my teeth, with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night I ain't comin' back

I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Tryin' to get a little bit tipsy...

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh whoa-oh-oh, oh whoa-oh-oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh whoa-oh-oh, oh whoa-oh-oh
