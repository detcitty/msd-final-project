" I was on stage and I was thinking of...
I felt like I know him though I know his heart
And I know what he wouldn't do to hurt me
But I didn't realize that
Feeling so confident, feeling so great about myself...
And then it just be completely shattered by one thing
By something so stupid
But then you make me feel crazy baby
Feel like it's my fault
I was in pain..."

You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known I'm hoping
That after this fever, I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
