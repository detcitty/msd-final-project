Hank Williams sang it, Number 3 drove it
Chuck Berry twanged it, Will Faulkner wrote it
Aretha Franklin sold it, Dolly Parton graced it
Rosa Parks rode it, Scarlett O. chased it

Smooth as the hickory wind
That blows from Memphis down to Apalachicola
It's, "Hi y'all, did ya eat well?
Come on in, I'm sure glad to know ya"

Don't let this old gold cross
And this Allman Brothers t-shirt throw ya
