Like some night bird homeward wingin
he seeks the sheltered nest
like the sailor's lost horizon,
he needs some place to rest
the songs that he's been singin'
no longer make much sense
and those stranger's cold perceptions
they've killed his confidence
nightingale, she sails away upon a sea of song
nightingale, she serenades his lonely, lonely life along
when his tired voice is broken
his golden hope is gone
she makes a lost soul's simple longing
somehow not so wrong
nightingale, nightingale
