Hello
Hi, honey, it's me
I went to see the doctor today
'Cause ever since you've been gone
I had a pain deep down inside
He says there's nothing wrong with me
I'm just missin' my man
So honey, please
Come on home as soon as you can

Doctor's orders say
There's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do
'Cause only you can cure me

Says in my condition
