Why'd you call me today with nothing new to say?
You pretend it's just hello
But you know what it does to me
To see your number on the phone

Now tell me, what do you want? What do you want?
What do you want from me?
Are you tryin' to bring back the tears
Or just the memories?

You keep takin' me back, takin' me back
Where I've already been
When we hang up it's almost like
I'm losing you again
