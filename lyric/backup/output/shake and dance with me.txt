Hey, baby
Why you going that way
Oh, sugar, come on
Go it my way

And I'm going to a place
Where funky people play
Oh, honey, we'll sing sure nuff
Dance the night away

Girl, you got that sexy smile
You move, it's driving me wild
Girl, I kinda kinda like your style
For you, I'd walk a country mile

Shake and dance with me
