Are you ready?
If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home
You say: If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S
We flying the first class
Up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' the life
In the fast lane
And I wont change
For the glamorous, oh the flouncy fluoncy
The glamorous,
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life)
For the glamorous, oh the flouncy fluoncy
Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperons and limousines
Shopping for expensive thangs
I be on the movie screens
Magazines and boogie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell
Drive thru, raw as hell
