I'm breakin' down gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an etch-a-sketch
My lips are saying goodbye
My eyes are finally dry

I'm not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
It killed me but I survived
And now I'm coming alive

I'll never be that girl again
No uoooh
I'll never be that girl again
No uoooh

My innocence is wearin' thin but my
Heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
