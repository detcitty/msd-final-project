Cut the cake
Give me a little piece
Let me lick up the cream
Cut the cake
Well, just a little piece
Baby you know what I mean
Cut the cake
Give me a little piece
A little lovin' on the side
Cut the cake
I need a little piece
Just to keep me satisfied
Chorus
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that cake
Well it tastes so good don't pass it all around
