Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to paid
Been hotter than a thousand suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more roads and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Get me a half an hour for a shave or a shower
And I'll be outside your house

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
