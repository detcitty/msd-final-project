(Dance, Mercy)
I can make you dance if you want me to
I can make you dance-dance-dance-dance-dance-dance...
All around the world in a real bad way (?)
I can make you dance if you want me to
But I can make you better let me show you what takes, baby
I can make you dance if you want me to
Now I've got a bet to show I bet you're gonna move (?)
I can make you dance if you want me to
It's controlled by Roger and it's right here in this tube (?)
I can make you dance if you want me to
Now I can set you free from your troubled troubled mind, baby
I can make you dance if you want me to
Just lend me your ears and let your feet keep time, baby
