I'm coming out (I'm comin')
I'm coming out
I'm coming out
I'm coming out

I'm coming out
i'm coming out
I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show
I'm coming out
I want the world to know
I got to let it show
There's a new me coming out
And I just had to live
And I wanna give
I'm completely positive
