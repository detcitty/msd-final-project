Girl, you're my sunshine
Take away the raindrops
Make it all worthwhile
Make all the pain stop

Just like a river
Keep love flowing
Don't let our world stop
Keep it going, oh Lord

Well, I love you just the way you are
Honey, don't change on me, yeah
Don't you change on me
I said, don't you change on me, no, no

Girl, you're my lucky star
Honey, don't change on me, yeah
Oh please, don't change on me
I keep begging, don't change on me, yeah

I used to wonder
Where would I find
