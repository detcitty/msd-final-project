Curtain going up-up-up - curtain going up-up-up

Walking along the street last night, I happened to see you within
You went into a picture show - the drama was about to begin
Followed you inside, didn't try to hide

The lights were down, you took his hand and when the movie star-arted
You moved right in so close to him - it left me broken hear-eart brea-ea-ea-eak

I caught your act, oh I saw what you did girl
