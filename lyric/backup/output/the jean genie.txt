A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back plazas
And ate all your razors while pullin' the waiters
Talking bout Monroe and walkin' on snow white
New York's a go-go and everything tastes right
Poor little Greene

Ohh
Hoo, ooo, ooo
Give up now

Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous
(Jean Genie)
He screams and he bawls
