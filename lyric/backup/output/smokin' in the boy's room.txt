Click highlighted lyrics to see their meaning

How you doin' out there y'ever seem to have one of those days
Where it just seems like everybody's gettin' on your case
From your teacher all the way down to your best girlfriend
Well, y'know, I used to have 'em just about all the time
But I found a way to get out of 'em let me tell you about it

Sitting in the classroom thinking it's a drag
