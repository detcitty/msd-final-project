Please don't turn me off ...yeah... like dis... where you at shawty?...

You fly as hell, swagga right, brown skin poppin
You know just how to talk to me
Know just how i like it
You turnin me on, you turnin me on, you turnin me on

Now wait a minute little buster
You got one more time to feel on my booty
Better recognize a lady
That ain't the way you do me
You turnin me off, you turnin me off, you turnin me off
Better recognize a real woman

(aaahhh)
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin me
Dime divas give it to me
(aaahhh)
I gotta be feelin your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me
Recognize a real woman

Goin up on it, you actin like you want it
And you stuntin like your daddy checkin for this little mama
