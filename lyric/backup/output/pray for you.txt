I haven't been to church since I don't remember when
Things were going great til they fell apart again
So I listened to the preacher as he told me what to do

He said you can't go hatin' others who have done wrong to you
Sometimes we get angry but we must not condemn
Let the good Lord do his job, you just pray for them
