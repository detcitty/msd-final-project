She don't believe in shootin stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments

You more like love to start shit
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author

And the weather's so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you Yeezy?"
