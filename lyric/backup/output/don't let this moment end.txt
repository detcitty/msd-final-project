kiss me... hold me... touch me
don't let this moment end...
please... don't let this moment end
at least 'til once again
our hearts can be together
please... i've never let you go
but still I need to know
that this night will last forever
oh please
you know you own my heart
just tell me where to start
don't make me wait much longer
oh please
i know tonight's the night
it never felt so right
just hold me in your arms... and
kiss me
