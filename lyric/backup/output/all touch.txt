I pushed her tense face away from me
I pushed her tense face away from me
The hard smile the voice going on like a razor blade on glass
All touch but no contact

It hit me like it hit me like
It hit me like a slap
All, all touch
All tough and all touch and no contact
Challenging eyes above the rim of a cocktail glass
Hoping I'd react
All touch and all touch and no contact
