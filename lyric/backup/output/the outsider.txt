Help me if you can
It's just that this,
this is not the way I'm wired, So

could you please
Help me understand why
You've given in to all these

Reckless dark desires, You're
lying to yourself again
Suicidal imbecile
Think about it,
you're pounding on the fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you precious

I'm over this. Why do you wanna throw it away like this?
