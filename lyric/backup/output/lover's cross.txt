They all said it was bound to happen
Was as just a matter of time
Now I've come to my decision
And it's one of the painful kind
Well, it seems that you wanted a martyr
Just a regular girl wouldn't do
Now baby, I can't hang on a lover's cross for you

I really got to hand it to you
Boy you really tried
But for every time that we spent laughing
