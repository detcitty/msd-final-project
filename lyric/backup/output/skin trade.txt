Working on the weekend, baby
She's working all through the night
A jump into the deep end gave her
The evidence she required
Takes five, she's got pearls
Don't fake it when it comes to making money
So she smiles, but that's cruel
If you know what she thinks
If you knew what she was after

Sometimes she wonders
And she laughs in her frustration

Would someone please explain
The reason for this strange behaviour?
