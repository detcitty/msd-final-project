Oh, look out
Out of the way

[CHORUS]
You wanna be in my gang
My gang, my gang
You wanna be in my gang
Oh, yeah

You wanna be in my gang
My gang, my gang
You wanna be in my gang

I'm the leader, I'm the leader
I'm the leader of the gang, I am
I'm the leader, I'm the leader
I'm the one who put the bang in gang

I can take you higher than
A kite every single night
I can make you jump out of bed
Standing on your head
