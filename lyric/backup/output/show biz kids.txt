While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night

While the poor people sleepin'
With the shade on the light
While the poor people sleepin'
All the stars come out at night

After closing time
At the guernsey fair
I detect the el supremo
From the room at the top of the stairs

Well I've been around the world
And I've been in the Washington Zoo
And in all my travels as the facts unravel
