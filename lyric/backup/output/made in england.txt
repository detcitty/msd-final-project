I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
I had a quit-me father
Had a love-me mother

I had Little Richard
And that black piano
Oh that sweet Georgia Peach
And the boy from Tupelo

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I was made in England

I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground
Crying God send me a brother
