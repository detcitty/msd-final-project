(Billy Nicholls) 

If I fell in a lake
Would you dive in or stand there and gape
And if I drowned, would you jump
Or would you let the water burst in my lungs
Well a stranger in the street
Maybe the only one on his knees
When your laying by the roadside
Waiting For A Friend to come.

Got my hopes
Got my doubts
My gut reaction say's I got to find out
