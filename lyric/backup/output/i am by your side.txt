I am by your side
give you strength when you're lost inside
you can always count on me
i will never hide you see
For i am by your side
shelter from the coldest night
you can always run to me
i will be there can't you see, oh no
And when the world has knocked you down
and you are trapped by your fears
they can never reach you from high ground, oh no
And i will never disappear
