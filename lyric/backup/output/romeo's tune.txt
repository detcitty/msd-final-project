Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say, "Everything's okay"
Bring me southern kisses from your room
Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say, "Everything's alright"

Let me smell the moon in your perfume
Oh, Gods and years will rise and fall
And there's always something more
Lost in talk, I waste my time
And it's all been said before
While further down behind the masquerade
