Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk
From a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do, hmmm?

Tears from your little sister
Crying because she doesn't have
A dress without a patch
For the party to go
But you know she'll get by

'Cause she's living in
The love of the common people
Smiles from the heart
Of a family man

Daddy's gonna buy you
A dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can

It's a good thing
You don't have a bus fare
It would fall through the hole
In your pocket and you'd lose it
In the snow on the ground
You got to walk into town
To find a job
