Hey hey hey
La la la
Hey hey hey
La la la

You come from here, I come from there
You rock out in your room, I rock a world premiere
We're more alike than any body could ever tell (Ever tell)

Friday, we're cool; Monday, we're freaks
Sometimes we rule, sometimes we can't even speak
But we can get up & let loose & LOL

It may seem clich√© for me to wanna say that you're not alone
And you can call me I'm cool but it's a simple fact, I got your back
