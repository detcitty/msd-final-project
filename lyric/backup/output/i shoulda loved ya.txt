I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Ooh, when I touched ya
I shoulda loved ya

There you were, I was blinded
After love, swore I couldn't find it
A seduction grabbed my hand
Ooh, my body screamed but my heart just didn't understand

Life between the sheets is fine
If all you want to make this time
But if you want to make it last
Ooh, you'll lose control if you drive too fast

I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Ooh, when I touched ya
