Never met a girl
Could make me feel the way that you do
(you're all right)
Whenever I'm asked
What makes a my dreams real?
I tell 'em you do
(you're outta sight)
Well tweedley dee, tweedley dum
Look out baby
'Cause here I come
(ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'm bringin' you a love that's true
(get ready)
Get ready
(get ready)
(ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'll stop makin' love to you
(get ready)
Get ready
(get ready)

Oh, don't you know I'm comin'?
(get ready, 'cause here I come)
On my way
(get ready, 'cause here I come)
