If it weren't for your maturity
None of this would have happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years
I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention
You wouldn't have been successful, and
If it weren't for me
You would never have amounted to very much

Ooh this could be messy, but
You don't seem to mind
Ooh don't go telling everybody, and
Overlook this supposed crime

We'll fast-forward to a few years later
No one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this
