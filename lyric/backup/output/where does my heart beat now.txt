So much to believe in
We were lost in time
Everything I needed
I fell into your eyes
Always thought of keepin
Your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave
Without a trace
Where do silent hearts go?

Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
