You've been around for such a long time now
Oh, maybe I could leave you but I don't know how
And why should I be lonely every night
When I can be with you, oh yes, you make it right
And I don't listen to the guys who say
That you're bad for me and I should turn you away

'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love
