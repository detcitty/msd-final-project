Girls are more fun, ooh, ooh
Girls are more fun
The party ain't begun
'Till all the girls come
Girls are more fun, mmm

Make you dance to the music
Have a good time, mmm
I could tell the way she moved, yeah
What was on her mind, mmm

She said the girls decide
If it's gonna be dead or alive
Bout choosing to arrive or not to show, mmm
Please understand, she took me by the hand
And pulled me closer than you wanna know
Then she whispered to me

Girls are more fun, ooh, ooh
Girls are more fun
The party ain't begun
'Till all the girls come
'Cause girls are more fun, ah, ooh

Good night turned to late night
