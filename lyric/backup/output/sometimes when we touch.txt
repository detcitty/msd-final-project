You asked me if I love you, and I choke on my reply.
I'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie.
And who am I to judge you on what you say or do
I'm only just beginning to see the real you.

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide.
I wanna hold you till I die
