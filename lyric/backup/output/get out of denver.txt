I still remember it was autumn and the moon was shinin'
Our 60 Cadillac was roarin' through Nebraska whinin'
Doin' 120 man the fields was bendin' over
Headin' out for the mountains knowin' we was traveling further
All our fires were blazing and the spinnin' wheels were turnin' turnin'
Had my girl beside me brother.
Brother she was burnin' burnin'

Up walked a Baptist preachin' southern funky school teacher
She had a line on somethin' heavy but we couldn't reach her
We told her that we needed somethin' that would get us goin'
She pulled out all she had and laid it on the counter showin'
