Every night I have the same old dream
'Bout you and me and what's in between
So many changes, so many lies
Try to run, try to hide
From everything that I feel inside
But I can't escape you or your frozen eyes

Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night

Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell
