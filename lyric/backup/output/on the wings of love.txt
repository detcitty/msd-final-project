Just smile for me
And let the day begin
You are the sunshine
That lights my heart within

And I'm sure that you're
An angel in disguise
Come take my hand and
Together we will rise

On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly

Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
