Hoo…ooh…
Well, well, well, well, well, yeah
Hoo…ooh…
When did you decide you were leaving
And when you did you stop believing in what we had
Was it when that girl appeared, was it when you started actin' weird
Well, well, well, well, well, well, boy, mmm
Was it her that made it so easy
For you not to touch me do, but not
Is it her that you hold so tight and thought her love was right
Well, well, well, well, well, well, boy, ho…ooh…
