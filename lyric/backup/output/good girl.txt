Hey, good girl
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you
What you're thinkin' about
You see a good boy
Gonna give you the world
But he's gonna leave you cryin'
With your heart in the dirt

His lips are dripping honey
But he'll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your loving
Go and throw away the key

Hey good girl
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man
