Cut up and I can't feel my hands
No need to chase
Can you relate? Can you keep up the pace like you're dyin' for this?

And when you say "I'm not okay"
I left my phone in the cab
Now you can't get me

I'm only gettin' started
I won't blackout
This time I've got nothing to waste
Let's go a little harder (harder)
I'm on fire
I won't blackout
