Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs

Lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the Lord no I'm just a fool
And a loving somebody don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?
