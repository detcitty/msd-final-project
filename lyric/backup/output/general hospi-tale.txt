Rock it hard, rock it steady
Pick yourself up and
Get yourself ready

Wave your arms
Let me hear you yell
Were gonna rap about
General Hospital

It started out
In Port Charles town
Where Frank Smith's mob
Used to hang around

No one could prove
That he was a crook
Till Luke stole his
Little black book

It had names and
Numbers all in code
So Luke and Laura
Had to hit the road

They had to find
The left-handed boy
Watch their step
They had to be coy

The gold involved
Was worth so much
Others wanted it
Like Sally and Hutch

But there's one thing
I must confess
Sally was a man
Who wore a dress

Luke kept his cool
He ain't no fool
He set them both up cold
Well Sally died
Hutch survived
And no one got the gold

Paging Dr. Noah Drake
To ICU to treat a
Case of heartbreak

They keep me waiting
I don't mind waiting
Don't call me crazy
No, I'm not lazy

My day won't go right
