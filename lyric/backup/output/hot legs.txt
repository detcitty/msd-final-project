Who's that knocking on my door
It's gotta be a quarter to four
Is it you again
Coming 'round for more?

Well you can love me tonight if you want
But in the morning make sure you're gone
I'm talkin' to you

Hot legs, wearing me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, are you still in school
I love you honey
