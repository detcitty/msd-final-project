What's up man! Hey yo what's up!

Yeah what's goin' on here?
Sick an' tired of five-oh runnin' up on the block here, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo Snow, they came around lookin' for you the other day.
Word? Word! Bust it!

You know say Daddy me Snow me, I go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says see Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane

A licky boom-boom down
Informer
You know say Daddy me Snow me, I go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says see Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane
A licky boom-boom down

Police-a them-a they come and-a they blow down me door
One him come crawl through through my window
So they put me in the back of the car at the station
From that point on I reach my destination
Where the destination reached was the East Detention
Where they whipped down me pants and looked up me bottom
So Informer
You know say Daddy me Snow me, I go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says see Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane

A licky boom-boom down

You know say Daddy me Snow me, I go blame
A licky boom-boom down
'Tective man says see Daddy me Snow me stabbed someone down the lane
A licky boom-boom down, so
Bigger are them think them have more power
