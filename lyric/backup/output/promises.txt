Here by my side
Are you close enough to take me to your paradise
Or am I going down to my loneliness
Could you be loving me more or less

Do you know
Are you ready for the feeling
Can you learn to grow
Out in a world of tears we,
We're hanging on
We come together,
We find the sun

(you all over me, all over)
You're the light
I am the love don't let me die away
(die away)
