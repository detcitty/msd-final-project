Everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
Everything is everything

What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
I wrote these words for everyone
Who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception
Instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game,
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? We're so confused
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that

Everything is everything
