Keeps them all waiting
They're standing in line
He never has to worry about being alone
He's taking his own sweet time
The man's mighty hot
Believe it or not
Every woman's after what the big boy's got
They know it's all a lie but they're taking their shot

He is such a smooth-talking man
They never want to let him go
He'll be gone when the morning comes
Then they'll be the first to know

It's just a big mistake
Such a big mistake
Well, it won't be the first
