I heard you're askin how I'm feelin'
I guess I'll play it day by day
I'm still around now my heart is healin'
But somethings never gonna change

'Cause now I know love ain't easy to find
I let you go, now I'm changing my mind

I know that love, it don't come easy
Took so long, it's been hard to find
And so, love, you must believe me
Ain't gonna let it slip away I know I was wrong
I want you back where you belong
Want you back where you belong
Back where you belong
