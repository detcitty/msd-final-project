Chorus:
Constantly
Constantly
Constantly
I think about you all the time
Constantly your on my mind

Verse 1:
At night I try
To close my eyes
But I, I cant get much sleep
You're always on my mind
You look so fine
Often pretend
That your my girl
Or at least my friend

Hook:
If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know
