It used to seem to me
That my life ran on too fast
And I had to take it slowly
Just to make the good parts last

But when you're born to run
It's so hard to just slow down
So don't be surprised to see me
Back in that bright part of town

I'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time
Will open up again

I'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched me once
Will smile and take me in

And I'll drink and dance
