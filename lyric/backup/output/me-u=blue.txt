With all my heart, I pledge my love forever
You've got my word, you and I will always be together
There maybe times, we have a disagreement
This love's too strong, to ever let it come between us

I would, I would keep this love alive Oh baby
I would, I would be cause otherwise

Me minus u equals blue
Can't imagine what I ever do
If it'd ever came to
Me minus u equals blue
I can't stand the thought I've lost so far
