Why should I worry when I know you're loving me
Why should I care when there's joy everywhere
Why can't I see the beauty of the life

Somebody I trusted, trusted
Somebody I knew quite well
Somebody I loved

But please don't put out the light
Put out the light, turn the day into night
Put out the light, put out light
Turn the day into night, turn the day into night
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
