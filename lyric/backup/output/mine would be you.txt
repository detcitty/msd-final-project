What's your all time high, your good as it gets
Your hands down best ever make-up sex
What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?
Well if you ask me, mine would be you

What's your worst hangover, your best night yet?
Your 90 proof, your Marlboro Red?
The best damn thing you lucked into
That's easy girl, mine would be you

Mine would be you
Sun keeps shining, back road flying
Singing like crazy fools
Making up our own words
