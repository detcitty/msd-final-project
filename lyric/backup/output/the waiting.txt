Oh, baby, don't it feel like heaven right now
Don't it feel like something from a dream
Yeah, I've never known nothing quite like this
Don't it feel like tonight might never be again
Baby, we know better than to try and pretend
Honey, no one could've ever told me 'bout this
I said yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The waiting is the hardest part
Every day you see one more card
