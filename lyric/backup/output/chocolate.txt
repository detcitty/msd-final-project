Hey now, call it a split, because you know that you will
Oh, you bite your friend like chocolate
You said, we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
Oh, we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no

Now run run away from the boys in blue
Oh, my car smells like chocolate
Hey now, I think about what to do
I think about what to say
I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it, play it, pause it

Oh, we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah we're dressed in black from head to toe
We got guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it
