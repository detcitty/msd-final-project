just say hey, if it feels alright
just say hey-ee-yeah, if ya feel alright

pay attention, listen here
crystals gonna make it clear
everybody here tonight
better have a real good time

let your hair down and decide
come go with me for the ride
dont sit down, get on up
join with the rest of us

hand in the air wavin
i want your body shakin
foot-stompin music rockin
no we are never stoppin
