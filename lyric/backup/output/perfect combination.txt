Two hearts together, we're a harmony so right
Two sparks united, we're a fire burning bright
For that you're always brand new
Right from the jump we had a hunch
That we had everything

Perfect combination
Lovers you and me
A perfect combination
We couldn't ask for any better

Perfect combination
We fit to a tee
A perfect combination
We know what takes to last forever, together

So deep inside we share a feeling that's so rare
