featuring O.G. Enius A.L.T.

[Intro Diane Gordon]

(chanting ahh)

[Verse 1 Frost]

I just woke up thank god it's friday
fire up the lac and hit the highway jump
to the carwash so we can hit them whitewall tires
Sedan DeVille sitting on L.A. Wires
and it's gotta be 80 degrees
I got a check in my pocket for 15 G's
hit the first interstate now I'm straight
stop at the record store to pick me up an old school tape
back in my ride see the spin of the tires
Kid Frost rolling bumping Earth, Wind, & Fire
it feels good holding 15 grand
so I parked the Sedan and I strolled in the green spans
give me a pair of your 50 30
cascades cortes that are jet black
