Life springs eternal
On a gaudy neon street
Not that I care at all

I spent the best part
Of my losing streak
In an Army Jeep
For what I can't recall

Oh, I'm banging on my TV set
And I check the odds and I
And I place my bet
I pour a drink
And I pull the blinds
I wonder what I'll find

I'm Leaving Las Vegas
Lights so bright
Palm sweat, blackjack
On a Saturday night
Leaving Las Vegas
Leaving for good, for good
