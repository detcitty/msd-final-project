Tell me baby what we're gonna do
I'll make it easy, got a lot to do
Watch the sun alight, coming true
Open the window, let it shine on you
Cause I've been sick and working all week

And I've been doing just fine
You've been tired of watching me
We've got to have a good time, boy
You can take it all these faces
Never keeping it real
I know exactly how you feel
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh
I will never let you down
When you feeling lone love
I'll be what you dreaming of
