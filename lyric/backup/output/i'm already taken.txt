My little third grade hand wrote
"I love you" on a note of yellow paper, and sent it to
the front of the room to a
little blonde-haired girl.

The blonde-haired girl just opened it,
and read it to herself
I was so embarrassed when she turned around and said:

I'm already taken
you spoke up to late
I love somebody else,
