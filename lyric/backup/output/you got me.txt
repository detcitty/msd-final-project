If you don't worry 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
If you don't worry 'bout where I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before until I'm overseas on tour
And peep this Ethiopian Queen from Philly taking classes abroad

She's studying film in photo flash focus record
Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score
She said she love my show in Paris at Elyse Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart

We knew from the start that things fall apart
Intense and shatter, she like, that shit don't matter
When I get home, get at her, pull out her phone
Whatever, let's lay, let's get together, shit, you think that not?
Think that dog went home and forgot?

Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Telling me the things I'm telling her is makin' her hot
Started building with her constantly 'round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop and keep telling me
