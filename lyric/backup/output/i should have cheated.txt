Baby, first of all let me say
You can't accuse me of all the things
You know that you are guilty of
And I see that it is easy for you to blame everything on me

If that's the case I should go have my fun
And do all the things you say I do
Boy, I can't continue to take this from you

I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying

I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have given away my love
As much as you accused me, I should have cheated

When you say I was out with somebody else
When my girl told me she saw you with some girl
But I didn't accuse you of something that I didn't see myself
Realize that I would never do anything to disrespect you
Trust me, you gotta stop accusing me
