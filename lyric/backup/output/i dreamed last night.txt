Oh, I dreamed last night I was hearing
Hearing your voice
And the things you said well, they left me
Left me no choice

And you told me we had the power
And you told me this was the hour
But you don't know how
If I could show you now

Well, I dreamed last night you were calling
Calling my name
You were locked inside of your secrets
