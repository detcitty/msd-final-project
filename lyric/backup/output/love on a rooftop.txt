We use to talk forever on a dime
Now we live together, never find the time
We use to walk as lovers on the sand
Now we`re working full time on our lifetime plan
We never stop to see the moon at night
We`re just too busy leading complicated lives

Whoa, whoa, whoa, I remember love on a rooftop
We couldn`t make our love stop
We were giving all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I remember holding you so tight
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Look at us now we're all grown up, we got it all together
