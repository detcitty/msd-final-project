Destroyed by MTV
I hate to bite the hand that feeds me
so much information
The pressure's on the screen
to sell you things that you don't need

Promotion boy
in a suit 'n' tie
he wants you to use it
you're too shot to lose it
It's pumpin' down the cable
like never so before
a COLA manufacturer
is sponsoring the war
Here comes the news
