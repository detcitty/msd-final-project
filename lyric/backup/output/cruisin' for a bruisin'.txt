You better run run run
Here we come
Revvin' our engines under the sun
Your cruisin' For a bruisin'
Whoo
Keeping it cool smooth and steady
Slick back hair man things are getting heavy
Your cruisin' For a bruisin'

Two wheels and an open road
We're wrapped in leather ready to go

Don't stop stop the music
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want
Anytime we want oh yeah, oh yeah
We just ride ride ride all day
