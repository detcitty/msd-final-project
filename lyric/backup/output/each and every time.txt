Whoa whoa ooh
Ooh ooh
Whoa whoa
Oh baby

Some lovers dazzle me with their limousines and pearls
They wine and dine you and they promise you the world
But then the party's over everything is changed
The fire's gone and nothing else remains

With you
It's more than just a passion
With you
I know that love will last

When you look in my eyes (whoa whoa)
You lift me up so high
Each and every time
Each and every time
And when the world is cold (whoa whoa)
You're always there to hold
Each and every time
Each and every time

I've had to pay the price of knowing how to love
And getting hooked on those who never could get enough
You are the reason I can take another chance
'Cause you know the meaning of a true romance
