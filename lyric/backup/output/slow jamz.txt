Are you gonna be?
Say that you're gonna be
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh...
She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther
Vandross, a little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are
you gonna be, are you gonna be? Well well well well well)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New
Edition, some Minnie Ripperton, and definitely set this party
off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are
you gonna be, are you gonna be? Well well well well well)
I told her to drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
I'm gonna bring the cool whip
Then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick
So we get our grind on
She be grabbing, calling me Biggie like Shine home
Man, I swear she fine homes
Why she always lying though
Telling me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones
She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I play 'Ready for the World' - she was ready for some action
My dawg said you ain't no freak, so you got to prove my
man wrong
