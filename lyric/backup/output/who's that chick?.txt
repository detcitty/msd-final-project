Who's that chick?

Feel the adrenaline

Moving under my skin
It's an addiction
Such an eruption
Sound is my remedy

Feeding me energy
Music is all I need
Baby I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care care care
(Feel it in the air Yeah)

She's been a crazy dita
Disco fever and you wonder
Who's that chick?
Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her

Too hot for you to leave her
