Once Upon a time, There was a little black girl, In the brust of projects of Detroit, Michigan
At fifteen, she was spotted by an Ebony Fashion Fair talent scout
And her modeling career took off, you better work

You better work, cover girl,
work it girl, give a twirl
Do your thing on the runway
Work, supermodel, you better work it girl, of the world

Wet your lips and make love to the camera
Work, turn to the left, work, now turn to the right
Work, sachay chantay
Work, turn to the left, work, now turn to the right

Work, sachay chantay
It don't matter what you wear
They're checking out your savior fair
And it don't matter what you do
