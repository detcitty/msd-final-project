We are the VA players
Love to the Neptune's and the 'Clipse
To ya bootleggers we breaking off both of ya legs
The underrated Magoo, comin' with the unexpected
The run away slave I, Mistameanor
Escaping from all ya fraudulent players
Last but not least, the heavyweight champion, Mr. Mosley
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without some little nieces and nephews
To cover all the beats, and the rhymes I been through
Time's up, sorry I left you
Thinking of this, I keep repeating them hits
Like that Aaliyah, Timberlake, or Missy Elliott shit
(Shit)
As you sit by the radio, hands on the dial tone
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Jump when you hear them speakers left it off
(Off)
Mr. VA 'bout to set it off
Well I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what ya know
Well my folks don' told me
(You got it, oh)
So, Up Jumps the Boogie, let the record work
(Uh huh)
And put me on like you red alert
'Cause it's the big bad Timmy, Magoo and Missy
Like Three The Hard Way, comin' straight out of Virginia
DJ's in the mix shows you better
