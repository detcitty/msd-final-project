All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is

All she wants is
All she wants is
All she wants is

Hey, spend your money on the corner, now
You know you've gotta save some for the shoeshine, boy
You've been pulling them by the hand inside
Oh, collecting all your toys

If you need a lead to heaven now
