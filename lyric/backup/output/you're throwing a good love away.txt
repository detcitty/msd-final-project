You had your fill,
And now you're on your way.
Searchin' for what,
Nobody knows.

You think you can go,
Just anywhere.
And toy with any willin' soul.

You play with love,
As though it's a game.
Leavin' a string of broken hearts,
Heart beats stoppin', oh, oh. (?)

But soon the day,
Will come and you'll learn,
The love that you waste,
You're gonna need it,
Again and again and again.

(You're throwing a good love away)

Oh baby,
You don't know it now,
You're gonna know it someday,
You're throwing a good love away.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You don't know it now,
You're gonna know it someday,

You led me to believe.
Walking together,
Down the aisle.

And now you're telling me,
It's all a big mistake.
I'm not the apple
Of your eye.

Baby,
You play with love,
As though it's a game.
Leavin' a string of broken hearts...
Now we're down the road,
But, don't wanna love me...

But soon the day,
Will come and you'll learn,
The love that you waste,
You're gonna need it,
Again and again and again.

(You're throwing a good love away)

Oh baby,
You don't know it now,
You're gonna know it someday,
You're throwing a good love away.

I'm a good man.
You don't know it now,
