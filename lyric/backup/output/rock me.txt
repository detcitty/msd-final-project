Sweet little baby, you don't have to go
Little baby, tell me you won't go
We'd be so good together if we had the time
'Cause being alone is a nowhere state of mind

Loving ain't no crime, oh no
I see your man ain't here, he don't care
The way of the night has gone and we'll move on
Got to find a way to face another day

I search the world for someone I'll never find
