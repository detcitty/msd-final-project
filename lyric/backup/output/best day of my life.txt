I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh

I'm never gonna look back
Woah, never gonna give it up
No, please don't wake me now

This is gonna be the best day of my life
