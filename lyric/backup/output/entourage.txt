Shh
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
All I can say is
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
Let's go

I don't need nobody else around, see
Love the way you compliment my style
Though you may end up bein' my only girl
'Cause when you're with me you're my whole world

Like when it's just me and you
Vibe is crazy between us two
You're my homie, my lover indeed and my friend
Now I said this before, I'ma say it again

Now here is the situation, I like what we've got happenin'
And I don't want nothin' comin' in between both me and you
