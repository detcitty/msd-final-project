"Hello Barbara, this is Shirley
I would like you to know that the man...
Now wait a minute Shirley
I'm a young woman
And can't afford to all the things you do for this man
I don't even have A job
And I can't buy his clothes, pay his car notes
And I surely can't keep money in his pocket
But I can give him what he needs, when he needs it
And that's all he expects from me"

I can give him love
