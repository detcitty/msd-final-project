How soon do we forget, how we felt?
Dealing with emotions, that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt, in this game

Maybe I'm the sinner, and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending, what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers, anyway?
When we're the same

Break up
Make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind?

'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you
(For you)
For you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on,
