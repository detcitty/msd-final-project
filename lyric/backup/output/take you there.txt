(CL Smooth)
Never judge a book by the cover; discover the Soul Brother
with the Mecca Don, workin brunette to blonde
How many Edison Con when I respond in full black
with us havin the Vernon villians back to back
Amazing grace when I face the great paperchase
For real it's long overdue, so I don't wanna talk to you
I stroke the hell out of mademoiselle who insisted
every night, she get her back twisted in the unlisted
I'm livin through my son so daddy see it this way
I want him in the NFL, his brother in the NBA
No doubt I with a 'piece, down in Mecca, all crazy
to the lady, none of this is make-believe
I breathe some of the most powerful lyrics of our century
Battle physically, conquer mentally
