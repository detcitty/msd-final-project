There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
Who's sorry now?

There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated...
And then you found her
You let the stranger in
(Together)
Who's sorry now?

Who's sorry now?

What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow?
