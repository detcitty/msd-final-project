Well, it's two a.m. in Nashville
Midnight in L.A.
You're asleep and
I'm out on the road

And I know that you can't hear me
But I'm talking anyway
It helps me kill some time
Ease the load

Hon, the man didn't like my song
And he sent me on my way
And I put my bus fare
On that tootie's bar

I'm out on Murfreesboro Road
