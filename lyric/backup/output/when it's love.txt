Hey!

Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Somethin' to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
'Til things get out of control

Oh! (How do I know when it's love?)
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Ohh (How does it feel when it's love?)
It's just something you feel together
When it's love

You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessin'
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson
