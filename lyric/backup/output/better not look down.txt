I've been around and I've seen some things
People moving faster than the speed of sound
Faster than the speeding bullet
People livin' like Superman, all day and all night

And I won't say if it's wrong or I won't say if it's right
I'm pretty fast myself
But I do have some advice to pass along
Right here in the words of this song

You better not look down
If you want to keep on flyin'
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead

You better not look back
Or you might just wind up cryin'
You can keep it movin'
If you don't look down

An old girl friend of mine
Showed up the other day
That girl had lived in love and for love
