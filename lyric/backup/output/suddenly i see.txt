Her face is a map of the world, is a map of the world
You can see she's a beautiful girl, she's a beautiful girl
And everything around her is a silver pool of light
People who surround her feel the benefit of it, it makes you calm

She holds you captivated in her palm
Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be

Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
(Suddenly I see)
This is what I wanna be
Suddenly I see
(Suddenly I see)
Why the hell it means so much to me
