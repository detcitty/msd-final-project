One year ago, love was touch and go
Time made me see, solved the mystery
Taught me that love and time
Will change your mind and make it right
Bring your darkness to the light
My heart sings in the night, my love I bring to you

With this lovin' I dedicate to you
For believing in me, I will make you mine

Side by side, for love we waited
Side by side, we're dedicated
Side by side, now we can make it
Side by side, we gonna shake it on down

Get down, get down, get down to love tonight
 (Side by side)
Get down, get down, get down to love tonight
