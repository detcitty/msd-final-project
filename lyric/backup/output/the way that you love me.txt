Chorus:
It's just the way that you love me
(you know you drive me crazy)
It's just the way that you love
(you know you drive me crazy)
I've been waiting for this moment secretly,
Counting every minute, every hour till you're with me
'cause I know just what's in store
And now I'm in your arms, baby close the door

Why waste another minute, ooh let's get right to it
