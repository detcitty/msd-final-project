Chloe, I know your sister turns everyone on
But you're the one I want
But you're the one I want, yeah

Yeah, front page magazine
Everybody says that she's the queen
But that's you to me
And I just want to let let you know that
She likes the flashing lights
I love the way that you like candle lights
Stay close by my side
I just want a chance to show that

If only you could believe in yourself the way I believe in you
I-I do (but you're the one I want)
If only you see all of the beautiful things that I see in you
