Bop 'til you drop in the hot city
Keep on working day and night
Don't stop 'til you get what you want
Bop 'til you drop 'til you're sittin' pretty
Burn the candle, burn it bright
Love won't, love won't wait
You wake up wired and draw your makeup
And the city breathes and the city jumps to life
Lately it seems your time is all used up
Chasing dreams of money and the good life
But there is something you've been thinking of
Lately, you're feeling the power of love
Everybody says it's so hard to hold
The alarm rings, you gotta get up, you gotta get up
Bop 'til you drop in the hot city
