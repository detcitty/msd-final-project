He be rollin' in his jeep
Cruisin' down on Fulton Street
Sometimes he bring food to eat
For his homies living on the street
Just about the other week
I bumped into him on the street
And he didn't even stop to speak
That's what he did on Fulton Street

Oh I been creeping 'round the way
Peepin' your 4 x 4 everyday
Wishing that you would notice me
And never did I dream
Swing your fat jeep 'round my way
Cell phone check me every day
And now I think of you and me
When I think of Fulton Street

You dropped the 40 out your hand
You said you wanna be my man
And we were swingin' to a slow jam
