Day 'n' nite
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps
This silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first, but surely finish last, last

'Cause day 'n' nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day 'n' nite
