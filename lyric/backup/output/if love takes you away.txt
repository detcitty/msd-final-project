Time's on your hands, on your hands
But you never had so much to do.
She's got your heart, got your heart
She'll never give it back to you.
You know love takes time,
But it's well worth the wait.
Tell her today, boy, tomorrow's way too late.

If Love Takes You Away,
It can take you where you want to go.
If Love Takes You Away,
