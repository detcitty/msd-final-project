Face to face, and heart to heart
We're so close, yet so far apart.
I close my eyes, I look away
That's just because I'm not okay.

But I hold on, I'll stay strong
Wondering if we still belong.

Will we ever say the words we're feeling,
Reach down underneath and tear down all the walls?
Will we ever have a happy ending
Or will we forever only be pretending?
