People say
Don't ever look behind
Happiness is just a state of mind
Rock and roll lives and breathes in the hearts of the young

So carry on
You're runnin' on borrowed time
Tryin' hard to survive
Keep on runnin'
Your time [Incomprehensible]
Keep your dreams alive

Follow your heart
(You got to follow your heart)
Living for the day, forget about tomorrow
Follow your heart
(You got to follow your heart)
Any other way can only lead to sorrow
