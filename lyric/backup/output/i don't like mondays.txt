The silicon chip inside her head
Gets switched to overload
And nobody's gonna go to school today
She's gonna make them stay at home

And daddy doesn't understand it
He always said she was good as gold
And he can see no reasons
'Cause there are no reasons
What reason do you need to be shown?

(Tell me why)
I don't like Mondays
(Tell me why)
I don't like Mondays

(Tell me why)
I don't like Mondays
I wanna shoot the whole day down
The Telex machine is kept so clean

And it types to a waiting world
