Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin'?

She snuck out one night an' met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out a-wavin' that 12-guage
We tore out the drive, he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late

'Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
An' I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss
Man, just gotta get goin', where the night might lead

I know what I was feelin'
