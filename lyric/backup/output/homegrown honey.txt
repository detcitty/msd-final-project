"Homegrown Honey"

Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But you're the kinda girl that's got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ain't nothing
They ain't never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ain't nothing hotter

Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I'll take a sip of that smile
I'll bet the boys at home can't leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
