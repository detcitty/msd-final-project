Every road that I walk
Every single flight I ever take
Though I'm thousands of miles away
In my mind every journey leads me closer to you
I've been all around this world
I've been in far too many states
But I'm under your spell
I've made my mistakes, oh you can probably tell

You're every dream that I dream
