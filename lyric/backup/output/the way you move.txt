Boom, boom, boom
Heh, heh

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxin', Outkast is everlastin'
Not clashin', not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little actin'
Now that's for anyone askin'
Give me one, pass 'em
Drip, drip, drop there goes an eargasm
Now you cumin' out the side of your face
We tappin' right into your memory banks thanks

So click-it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin', like two midgets in the back seat wrestlin'
Speaker box vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass

I like the way you move
I like the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
