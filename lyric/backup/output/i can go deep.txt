[Intro]
So tell me baby
Whatchu wanna do?
We got all night

So baby it's on, it's on, it's on, yeah
Deeper, deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
Cuz I can go on and on and on

You've got to show me lady
Just how you feel
I want to relax your mind
And go so deep
Because I can go deeper baby
Deeper than he's ever gone
