Kevin wasn't really all that popular in school
But I remember well the day I thought, now that guy's pretty cool
He pulled into the parking lot and everybody cheered
'Cause he'd gone and painted his entire Chevy Cavalier

Camouflage (camouflage) Camouflage (camouflage)
Disappears when it pulls out of his garage
Camouflage (camouflage) Camouflage
