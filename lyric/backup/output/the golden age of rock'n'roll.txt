Mott The Hoople
The Hoople
The Golden Age Of Rock 'n' Roll
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The golden age of rock and roll...

Everybody hazy, shell-shocked and crazy.
Screaming for the face at the window.
Jeans for the genies, dresses for the dreamies,
Fighting for a place in the front row.

Ohhh, Ohhh, Ohhh
(It's good for your body, it's good for your soul)
Ohhh, Ohhh, let's go!
(It's the golden age of rock and roll).
