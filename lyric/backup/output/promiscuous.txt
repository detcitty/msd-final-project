Am I throwing you off?
Nope
Didn't think so

How you doin' young lady
That feelin' that you givin' really drivin' me crazy
You don't have to play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

If you looking for a girl that'll treat you right
If you lookin' for her in the day time with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem I don't see no ring on your hand

I be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone and it's you that I want
