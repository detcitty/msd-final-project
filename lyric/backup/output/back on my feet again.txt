I was so lonely until I met you
Told myself I'd get by without love
Drownin' my sorrows
Avoiding tomorrows
Kind of felt that I just had enough
You light up my face with your jokes and your smiles
And the way that you came here tonight
Don't know what you got
But I'm sure glad I found you
Could be wrong but it sure feels right
And here I am
