The snow is fallin', The city is white.
You're eyes are shinin', Like diamonds tonight,
And we're all alone, There's no one home.
You're finally in my arms again.

The night is silent and christmas is here.
I couldn't ask for more than havin' you near.
Cuz I love you girl, (Love you girl)
And I always will, (Always will)
And now I know the moment is right,
The moment is right.
