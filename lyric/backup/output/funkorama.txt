We, hah!
This is Funk Doctor Spock!
As we look, at our clocks
We gonna take you, on a ship to another journey
to the Darkside
Hah, we've conquered, new evidence, that there is life

My funk prognosis make my brains come uncoast
One hundred percent funk runs blood straight through your nose
I don't have to be Madonna, to make your eyes freeze
Visine's for eyes when you smoke the thai weed
For this, you need a journalist scientist
Keep your eye in this, funk cosmical, far from logical
I blow the spot up in any hood or boondox
