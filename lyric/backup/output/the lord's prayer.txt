Ready? (I'm ready!)
O! I'm gonna get you in the end!
Getcha! Getcha! Getcha!

Our father which art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy se sex sex sex Earth
As it is in Heaven.

And lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us from evil.
For thyne is the kingdom,
Power and the glory
Forever and ever amen.

Fury, chastity, burden,
Sacrifice, claim me guilty.
Burt white skin.
Running red, red on white,
Judge, icon, icon,

Never talk blabber to me.
Red running revenge.
Revenge getcha getcha getcha revenge
Never talk blabber to me.
Shalalalala... O no... no...

A knock knock knocking
Knock knock knocking on heaven's door.
Let me in! O let me in!
La La La Woo-oo-oo!
Who's that knocking on my door?

He floats like a butterfly,
Stings like a bee;
Floats like a butterfly but he
Stings like a bee.

Yedelay shedelay.
Ding-a-ling-a-ling.
Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-fucking-ding
On the door, on heaven's door.

Bawk bawk bawk
Bawk bawk bawk BAWK!
