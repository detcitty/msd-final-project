Yeah, she moved back around here
35 weeks ago today
Oh down the lane

At night she walks on the banks
And remembers how she dreamed of rowing away
And how she left one day

She left with a driven look in her eyes
Came back around with it still inside
Take give it some time and you'll forget about it too
We know they always do
Well I know some fine day you will find your way

Across the river, across the river
