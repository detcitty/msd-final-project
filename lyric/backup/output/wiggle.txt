Hey, yo, Jason
i'm
Say somethin' to her
Holla at her
I got one question

How do you fit all that... in them jeans?

You know what to do with that big fat butt
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

Just a little bit of... swing
Patty cake, Patty cake
With no hands
Got me in this club making wedding plans
If I take pictures while you do your dance

I can make you famous on Instagram
Hot damn it
Your booty like two planets
Go head, and go ham sandwich

Whoa, I can't stand it

'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt
