Gangster, yeah, yeah
Hey, na-na-na-na-na-na, hey

Why would you wanna bring somethin' between us
There's nothin' between us, oh, ay
Why would you wanna use a life to keep us
To keep us together, uh, oh-oh

Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other, no good for each other
Better when we're both apart, better when we're both apart
We're no good for each other
