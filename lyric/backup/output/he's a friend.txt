He's a friend of mine, 
He's a friend of mine, 

There was a time, I didn't believe at all, 
Then one day, I had to give him a call, 
There I was lying flat on my back, 
The doctor said, I had a heart attack, 
I said a prayer, before I went to sleep, 
Next day you'll know, I was back up on my feet, 

Oh, 
He's a friend of mine, (He's a friend of mine,)
He's a friend of mine, (I want everybody to know it,)
He's a friend of mine, (Yeah, He is.)
He's a friend of mine, (He is a friend of mine,)
