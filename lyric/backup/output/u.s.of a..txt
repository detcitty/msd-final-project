I worked in the fields this morning
I traveled your highways today
Used a creek and a rainbow for a roadmap
And a tree for a chapel to pray

And I'm so proud to sing your praises
And to live in the land of the free
I'm just one of your children who loves you
You're home, sweet home to me

United States of America
Where I can be whatever I can be
Free to think as I choose
Right or wrong, win or lose
Where my only limitation is me
