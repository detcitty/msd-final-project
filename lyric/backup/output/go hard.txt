I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from

If you could you would get rid of me
What you gon’ do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'ma go hard

If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin’ money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart

So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, you gots to go on
I am gettin’ it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go, go hard

I go the hardest, flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself I mean ughh, were do I start?
First I stand around and vomit, then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad, won't no body get up on it

I flow sick, nigga how sick sea sick
Got your hand out don't look at me, bitch
You lookin’ at who made me rich
You lookin’ at who made me rich

I have some wins some losses
Just a life of a god damn boss's
With the top off lookin’ for a girl
With a ass as fat as Tracy Roselet

This is dope as is get
Dope as a mother fuckin’ acid trip
