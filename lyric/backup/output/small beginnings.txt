In the morning when you start your day
Do you feel yourself quite lost
In a world of countless millions
And the tide of your life got tossed
Don't think you're getting nowhere
You know we all must start
From very small beginnings
Off to a better part

In the rush and hassle of your day
When all your world seems mad
Do you look at everything you see
