(Phil Vassar, Julie Wood)

When I hear you stop and laugh out loud
When you're fallin' fast asleep
When you're in the middle of a crowd
When you're lyin' close to me
When I hear you softly say my name
When you're high and when you're low
When you don't need me to explain
'Cause you already know
When you smile that way
I know, every night and day

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
