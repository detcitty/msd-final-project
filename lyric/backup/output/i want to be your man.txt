Hey, lady, let me tell you why
I can't live my life without you (Oh, baby)
Every time I see you walkin' by, I get a thrill
You don't understand, but in time you will
I must make you understand

I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
I want to be your man (Yes, I do, baby)
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
