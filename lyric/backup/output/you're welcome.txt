Okay, okay
I see what's happening yeah
You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel, It's adorable!
Well it's nice to see that humans never change

Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes it's really me, It's Maui! Breathe it in
I know it's a lot, the hair, the bod!
When you're staring at a demigod

What can I say except "You're welcome"
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy!

Hey, what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
