Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, wait a minute now
Uh, oh
Uh, uh
Can ya'll hear me out there?
Lunatics, is y'all ready?
Let me hear ya
Uh, oh

Uh I'm a sucka for corn rows and manicured toes, hey
Fendi capri pants and Parasucos, alright
Passadity is a city, with one or two throws
I'm droppin' 'em outta high school straight into the pros
Who knows? I know
And I love it when you make your knees touch your elbows
And break it down low to the flo', and there you go
Now throw it on me slow
And everytime I Busta Rhyme, baby gimme some mo'

And you say you like that, when I hit it from behind
And I'll be right back, yeah that's my very next line
I use it, time after time, when I'm speakin' my mind
It's no matter if I'm shootin' game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her, "Who dat is, talkin' that shit about the 'tics?"
Somebody probably jealous, 'cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin' shit like this
Should we apologize? Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, hey!

Andele andele mami, E I E I
Uh-oh! What's poppin' tonite?
Andele andele mami, E I E I
Uh-oh! If the head right, Nelly there every night
