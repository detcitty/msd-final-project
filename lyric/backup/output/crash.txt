Here you go way too fast
Don't slow down you're gonna crash
You should watch, watch your stay here
Don't lookout, you're gonna break your neck

So shut, shut your mouth
Cause I'm not listening anyhow
I've had enough, enough of you
enough to last a lifetime through

So what, what do you want from me?
Got no words of sympathy
And if I go around with you
