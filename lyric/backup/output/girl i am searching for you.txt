Tell me why
It always has to end
It seems the loving is over
Before it ever begins

It happens every time
My heart gets in the way
And now you're blowing my mind
I just can't find my way, lady

And if you see me cryin'
Just touch my hand, don't pass me by
'Cause girl, I am tryin'
To find you, I need you, lady

'Cause girl, I am searching for you
And will you help me find my way
