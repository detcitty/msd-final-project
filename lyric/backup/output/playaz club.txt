(Chorus)
Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the fool or kick it in the tub
Cuz we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

I got a hoe named Real de Real
She got a buddy named SP 12 now you know the deal
We getz freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin real tight
Somethin to roll to somethin to stroll to
If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo
A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till these women get the notion that they runnin the game huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worse then
Fillmoe, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on the remote at the playaz club

(chorus)

(more champagne, Mr. Forte?)

From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh
They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
