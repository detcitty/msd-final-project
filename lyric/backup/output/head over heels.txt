Been running so long
I've nearly lost all track of time
In every direction
I couldn't see the warning signs
I must be losing it
'Cause my mind plays tricks on me
It looked so easy
But you know looks sometimes deceive

Been running so fast
Right from the starting line
No more connections
I don't need any more advice
