If I could escape I would but, first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?

If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
...
And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together
...

Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(The sweet escape)
If I could be sweet
(Sorry boy)
I know I've been a real bad girl
(I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt whatsoever
We can make it better

Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
