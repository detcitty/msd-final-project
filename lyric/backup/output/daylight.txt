Okay everybody, are you ready for this?
Watch out, cause here we go again!

And it looks like daylight
Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again
People are getting up,
We're just getting in
That's the only, only time
When me and my baby can unwind

Five o'clock in the morning
Party's still going strong
There's a conversation over in the corner
And dancin' on the lawn

Ooh, and the music is groovin'
Everybody's getting down in their stocking feet, yeah
Sleepy eyes are peepin'
Through the window from across the street

And it looks like daylight
Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again
People are getting up,
We're just getting in
Ooh, but that's the only, only time
When me and my sweet baby can unwind

And I swore to myself, yes I did
