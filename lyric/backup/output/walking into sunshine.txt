Too much rainy days
Rainy days
Find so much lazy ways
Lazy ways

I've got to get away, baby
This kind of life is not for me

I'm working day and night
Night and day
Working for my pay
On your way

It's all over me
I can't stand it
This kind of life
Is not for me

I need a holiday
Get away from the rush
I've gotta get away
From the rush of the week
If the cost is cheap
