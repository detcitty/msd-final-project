You make me say ow... 

Chunky, chunky A
Chunky, chunky A

I've had many girlies
In my life and time
Light, dark, short, tall
Women of all kind

A ister named Velda
A snow named Gidget
I even got busy
With a cute little midget

But nothing made my heart sing
Nothing seemed to last
The future looked dim
Just like the past

Surprise from the sky
Fell a dream called you
No one's ever rocked me
Quite the way that you do

Cause your love
(Your love, your love)
Makes me say owww
So good to me, girl

Your love
(Your love, your love)
Makes me say owww (oww)

It, it, it hurts so good
When you do what you do
