Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
It's plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say, I hope U are in these arms of mine

And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy cause after U all one can do is die
Could U be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World

Could U be
It's plain 2 see
U're the reason that God made a girl
