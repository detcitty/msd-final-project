You're the only power
You're the only power that can
You're the only power
You're the only power that can, ohhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh

If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
