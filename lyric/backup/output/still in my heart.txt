Oh, I just want you to know
No matter where you go
It doesn't matter 'cause you're still in my heart

Thinkin' of you brings tears to my eyes
Seems yesterday, we were planning our lives
I'm so confused, wonderin' why
How could you leave without sayin' goodbye

Picture your smile inside of my head
Still smell your cologne all over my bed
Miss you so much, I pray every night
