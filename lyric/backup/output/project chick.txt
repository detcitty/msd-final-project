This is for Deshawn, Eshlawn, Lil Mama, an' her friends
Lisa, Teresa, Maria, Tia, Lia and Kim
I love y'all broads, no disrespect to my dogs
But I love y'all broads, yeah, I love y'all broads

To the ladies havin' babies without no drama
To my niggas with figgas say I love my baby momma
I bought them shoes, them tattoos, an even fixed yo breasts
I put you inside the flyest rides an even put a "S" on yo' chest

This is for the ones who wobbled it an be puttin' they mouth on it
An they suck everything out of it then they catch it and swallow it
I'm Lil' Weezy for sheezy, I'm off the heezy believe me
See me, I squeeze in between it, and then I leave it so greasy

When I come through in a Rolls Royce, leave them with no choice
But to hop up in it an just let me make they throat moist
Ruby red an vodka it just carry a nigga
Give me three minutes maybe four she be wantin' to marry a nigga
