Spirit of Marilyn calling me, audibly
Bawling she, said that she would never leave
Continued to torture me
Telling me to come with her
Underneath my comforter
And she brought a gun with her
Pills and some rum with her
Tip me on the balcony telling me to jump with her
Yeah I'm in the ghost but I ain't doing stunts with her
I ain't tryna be that haters wanna see that
But I got â€˜em aggy cause I win the gold like Gabby

She's just a girl and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Fill with catastrophe, but she know she can fly away

Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
