Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high
Why do I stay high

If I could teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thug-n-harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thugsta just like me (like me)

How many mo days on this old earth can you see
It's a crime to me
So we should get ready for armageddon
Cause I know God should be ready to roll
And do away with all of the wicked shit like Mr. Police-man
And dog if you with it then pump ya fist in tha air
And pray for the politicians freely; get a amen?
The last days of the last days

Thats why I get high, that's why I get high
I'm holdin on to my soul
But nobody knows when it all unfolds
Then when I don't go
Remember the days cause all I got
I go on my own with bone
