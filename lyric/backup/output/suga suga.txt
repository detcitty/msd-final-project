So tight, so fly
You got me lifted, you got me lifted

You got me lifted shifted higher than the ceiling
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Suga how you get so fly?

Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?

You know its leather when we ride wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Girl you keep it so fly with your sweet honeybuns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes

Off top I can't lie I love to get blowed
You my lil'sugar, I'm yo little chulo
And every time we kick it it's off to the groovy
Treat you like my sticky ickey or my sweet ooey gooey
(Fa real though)
