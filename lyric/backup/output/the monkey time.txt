Now there's a place right across town, whenever you're ready
Where the people gather 'round, whenever they're ready
And then the music begins to play
You feel a groove comin' on its way

Are you ready? Yes I'm ready.
You get yours, I got mine
For the monkey time, monkey time

Now this dance that the people do, don't know how it started
All I know is when the beat brings the feel
it's hard to get parted
