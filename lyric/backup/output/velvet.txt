I just wanna

It's in the air
The way you smile when you reciprocate my stare
Just one breath and everyone knows that you're there
With every hit I take, you move that waist and I wanna die
A girl like you, adore
The way you drop that thing could start another war
And my hands are gettin' eager to explore
Cherry lips are singin' "Purple Rain" and I feel alive
