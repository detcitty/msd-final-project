No Ceilings
Wait a minute
Wait a minute, where you going?
Ain't my business where you going
I just want some before you go and
Wait why you in your feelings when I wanna feel something?
Why you in your purse when I'm tryin' to tell you something?
Why you on your phone after 2 in the morning?
Who the fuck you talking to at 2 in the morning girl?

Cuz I ain't got time for your matrix yeah yeah yeah
And if the side bitch start acting crazy

Yeah, feel like its over, you know its over with
You get my feelings in time and shit
