Does he love me I want to know
How can I tell if he loves me so
Is it in his eyes?
Oh no! You'll be deceived
Is it in his sighs?
Oh no! He'll make believe
If you want to know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is

Is it in his face?
Oh no! That's just his charms
In his warm embrace?
Oh no! That's just his arms
