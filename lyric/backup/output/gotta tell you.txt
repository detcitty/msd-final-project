Gotta Tell You
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your love for me came as a waterfall
Flowing inside me like never before
Your love for me something I didn't see
But, baby, I know better now
When you walked in the room that very night
A special feeling just burst inside
It was only you nobody else
But, baby, I know better now
Don't wanna love you if you don't love me
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now
But it wouldn't be right if I (if I)
