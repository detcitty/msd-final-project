The marching band came down along Main Street
The soldier blues fell in behind
From where I stood, there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line.
And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fianc√©e
From where I stood I saw she was crying
And through her tears I heard her say

"Billy don't be a hero
