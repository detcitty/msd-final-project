Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they huh?
I spit it through the wire man
It's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation, man

Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-Town what's going on
Uh huh, yeah, yeah
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork

How do you console my mom or give her light support

Telling her, her sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmit Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
