You gave me my first taste of love,
You put me in a groove and all I could think of
Were your sweet lips upon my face,
You tender voice I thought I could never erase
Although you're gone, and I'm all alone
In an unhappy home

I have learned to do without you,
Even though, even though it hurts me deep down inside
I have learned to do without you
I have wiped those tears from my eyes.
