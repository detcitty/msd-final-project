Alone you and I intertwine
Refreshing conversation for the mind
As we stare we both seek and hope to find
Real love purified

Use your heart and not your eyes
Baby, just relax and ride
If you got time then I got time, yeah, yeah
Free your thoughts and watch them fly
Use your heart and not your eyes
