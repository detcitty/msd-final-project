Run and tell all of the angels, this could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
me up a new revolution ‘cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughin' and watched the last one die

Yeah, I'm lookin' to the sky to save me
Lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication
Lookin' ‘cause I'm tired of lyin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
