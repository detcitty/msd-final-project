Written by Tommy Shaw, Jack Blades, Ted Nugent

Never again
You say the words and let
The sunshine in again
You can close your eyes
And know it's safe inside
To sing you lullaby

Now I lay me down

You broke the chains
And you won't be silent anymore
Oh no! Now you're gonna shout about it
No! No more! Yeah yeah this is the end
