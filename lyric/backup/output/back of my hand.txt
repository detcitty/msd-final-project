You only call me if your feeling blue
You tell me I don't pay attention to you
But if you only knew, just what I'm going through
You wouldn't phone those guys who mess around with you girl
When I call you I get stack of lies
You whip 'em out before you dry your eyes
I'm not a fruit machine a nineteen sixties dream
And in the 'bet you' list I bet you've never seen her

Your not unreadable, your not unbeatable,
I know just what you are, don't push your luck too far
Your not untouchable, not just another girl
I'd get in touch with you, I only wish you knew that
