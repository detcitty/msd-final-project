Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...

I was young
When I met you
You were my first love
Love was new, oh, whoa

But then you went away
And broke my little heart
I learned to live with pain
While we were apart

Time
Brought us back together again
We became lovers
We became friends

I just wanna thank you
For the love you gave
I just wanna thank you
For the love we made

I just wanna thank you
Just thank you
'Cause even though we're not together
