shoo doo doo wop
shoo doo doo woo
shoo doo doo wop
shoo doo doo woo

repeat

You never have to worry about my love
as long as you're taking care of business with my heart
see i'm the kind of girl
to dedicate my world
and you gotta give me all you got
i need it all baby every drop

you got to show me
