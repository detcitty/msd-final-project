Whatever it is I do, I try to think about you.
I have a love for you that nothing hides.
Whatever it is I do, I'm only thinking of you.
I hope you look at me through patient eyes.

I've become amused.
I've become blind.
I've become what I know not breathes.
You seem illiterate to all my emotions.
I stand corrected, how well you read.
You speak the truth, you speak the me.
You feel the love I have yet to find.
I know it's there, I know it's there.
But I let the sandcastles kill my mind.
Pathetic me, I long to be you.
I think I'm close but i stand so far.
The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear.
I miss the Love only 'cause they starve'.
Oil and water, lust and sympathy.
I life and death my way through the sun.
