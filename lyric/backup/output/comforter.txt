Talk to me, baby.
I'm listening.

Lay down.
And tell me what's on your mind.
What exactly did he do? To make you cry this time?
Well, I will be your comforter. I will make it right
He cast a shadow on your heart. And I will bring back your light
Come in...

I see he's hurt you again,
When you're in pain I'm in pain
