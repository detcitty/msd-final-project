Terri said she
Didn't wanna go back
To the City of Angels no more
She had seen enough
Fallen angels to last a lifetime

I told her not to be bitter
Nothing ever stays the same
She knew all the time
I was lying
I could see her pain

[CHORUS]
She said she
Wants to go out tonight
And feel the warmth
Of these city lights
And wants the clock
