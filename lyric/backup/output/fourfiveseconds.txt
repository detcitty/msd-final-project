I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time

'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh thats all I want
