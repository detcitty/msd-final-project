You always said my eyes
Were the windows of my soul
You could always fill my love
And pain without been told
I never knew how, but I don't
Even dare to look at you now.

So, if you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we leave
Walk on by, walk on by

Make believe
That you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry, ooh baby,
