We could just go home right now
Or maybe we could stick around
For just one more drink
Oh yeah

Get another bottle out
Let's shoot the breeze
Sit back down
For just one more drink
Oh yeah

Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times
That we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the glass
Cause the last few days
Have gone too fast
So let's give em hell
Wish everybody well
Here's to us
Here's to us

Stuck it out this far together
Put our dreams through the shredder
