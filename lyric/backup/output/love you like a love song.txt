It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one
So your melody will play on and on
With the best of 'em

You are beautiful,
Like a dream come alive
Incredible
A centerfold, miracle, lyrical
You've saved my life again
And I want you to know baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
