Ooh, and it's alright and it's coming along
We gotta get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We gotta get right back to where started from
A ha

Do you remember that day (that sunny day)
When you first came my way
I said no one could take your place
And if you get hurt (if you get hurt)
