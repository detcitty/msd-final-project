I wanna see you move your body like a snake, yeah
Hey yo can y'all hear me out there alright
Now this is what I wanna see
I wanna see all of the ladies line up right here now

Move your body like a snake ma, like that
Shake it 'til it wanna break ma, like that
Don't hold back let it go na', like that
Let your money make a jump na, like that
Let me see ya go whoa' na, like that
Bring it up and let it roll na', like that
I love the way you work your chocha, like that
You make me wanna get to know ya, like that

Luvin' the way you move so sexy
Mama you're bringin' me to my knees
Hands in the air like you came to party
Shakin' that ass makin' the whole club freeze
Get down get down
Girl I wanna dance with you baby no doubt
Get down get down
Baby we can get together turn this party out

Move your body like a snake ma, like that
Shake it 'til it wanna break ma, like that
Don't hold back let it go na', like that
Let your money make a jump na, like that
Let me see ya go whoa' na, like that
Bring it up and let it roll na', like that
I love the way you work your chocha, like that
You make me wanna get to know ya, like that

Like two gorillas in a jungle makin' love
Poppin' it like a string on a guitar
Superstar you know who you are?
Body smokin' like a Cuban cigar
