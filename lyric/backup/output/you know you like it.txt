Some people want me to be heads or tails
I say no way, try again, another day
I should be happy, not tipping the scales
I just won't lay letting my life get away

I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower
I don't take things as they come
If they bring me down
Life can be cruel if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun
Don't tell me what could be done

You know you like it but it drives you insane
