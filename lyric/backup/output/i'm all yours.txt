I'm all yours tonight
Got a feeling that I can't deny
Everything about you gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
I'm all yours

Success is here, and she don't play
I'm ready for her though, throw her my way
Heart torn, and I doubt you can save it
It's okay, it's been like that since I was a baby
Thoughts deep, scuba, my mind is free
Opposite of Cuba
Take me for my money or my fame
Papa don't try, see right through ya
Four lawsuits, one year, two down, two to go
Fame, expensive year
Good thing I know I was built for the war
I was built to be all yours
Abuelita is a rebel, my mother's fighter
Tia is a G, and my sister's a rider, dale
