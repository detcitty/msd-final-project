Hey, hey, hey
What ya got to say?
Hey, hey, hey
What ya got to say?
Hollywood
Hollywood swinging
Hollywood
Hollywood swinging

I remember not too long ago
I went to the theater
And I saw the Kool in the gang show
I always wanted to fit a band, yes I did
To sing my songs, sing my songs
And become a bad piano playing man
So here I am, here I am in this Hollywood city
