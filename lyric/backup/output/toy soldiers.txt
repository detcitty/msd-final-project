(Step by step
Heart to heart
Left, right, left
We all fall down
Like toy soldiers)

It wasn't my intention to mislead you
It never should have been this way
What can I say
It's true, I did extend the invitation
I never knew how long you'd stay

When you hear temptation call
It's your heart that takes, takes the fall
(Won't you come out and play with me)

Step by step
