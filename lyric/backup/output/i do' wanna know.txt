You have said as much as you can say
Your heart is just about to overflow
Must be something more I can do
Some new plateau, I'm listening to you
Dying to know
Everything that you're feeling
Every change you undergo
Just don't tell me that you love me
Because I do' wanna know

I do' wanna know how much you love me
I do' wanna know how much you care
I do' wanna, I do' wanna, I do' wanna know
I do' wanna do what I'm supposed to
I do' wanna wear what I'm supposed to wear
I do' wanna, I do' wanna, I do' wanna know
