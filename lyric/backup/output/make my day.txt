With Clint Eastwood

Well it was going down
On the bad part of town
At an all-night grocery store
The old man there, his hands in the air
His customers on the floor
The hoods took all the money
And all of his hard earned pay
But then a tall man stepped in
With a cynical grin and said
(Eastwood) Go ahead, make my day

Somewhere a girl's walking all alone
And now it's getting dark
She knows she'd better hurry home
So she cuts right through the park
She finds herself surrounded
