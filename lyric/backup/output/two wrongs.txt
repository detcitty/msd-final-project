I'm just sittin here playing the guitar (Oooh)
(City High. Claudette, 'Clef)
Excuse me, if you see me screaming
Deep in my mind, i'm only dreaming

cuz if i wake girl, and you're not by my side
i'd feel like half of me, is no longer alive
so please shorty, before you walk out that door, booby
would you listen to my song?
if only, i give you one last chance
with the devil, you can no longer dance
you got to be faithful, so we could be fruitful
build a family, and follow God's destiny

so just before i want to run to the block papi, i might listen to your song
ooh, before you walk out that door, listen
they say two wrongs don't make it right ((don't make it right))
So if i'm wrong i ain't trying to fight
I'm trying to have some dinner with some candlelight ((yeeahh))
lay up in the bed and make love all night

So papi I wont leave, maybe i'll just stay
you promise me that you'll do the same
