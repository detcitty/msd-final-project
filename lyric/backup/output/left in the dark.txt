Where did she touch you,
How did if feel,
Why did you let it begin
What did she whisper and
What did it mean, and
Where do you think it will end?
How long did it last
Do you think it will stop
Did you get to try anything... new
How good was she - honestly
Where did you go and
Who made the very first move, who made the very first move,
who made the very first move.

You don't have to sneak in the doorway
Just come on into the room
I've been lying in our bed in the dark all alone
And I've been waiting, I've been waiting for you

There's been no reason to move
It's been as still as a tomb
I needed you oh so badly tonight
But I guess you had better things to do

I should have known that it was coming to this
But I must have been blind
I bet you still got a trace of her love in your eyes
and you've still got her eyes on your mind
