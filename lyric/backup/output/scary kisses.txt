there's not much of a trick to playing safely baby
people do it every day
you can see them living sensibly with lots of care
lonely in a cautious way

you be alone for me
i'll be alone for you
one and one people alone make two
let's stir things up a bit
throw the pieces up to the sky

baby i want scary kisses
i want hits and i want misses
i want hell and i want bliss
and that stuff between it
and you gave me safety and
the showtime all that drove me crazy
i would rather run and fall then take no chance at all
then take no chance at all

i would rather sit here by myself
then settle down with someone safe and sound
