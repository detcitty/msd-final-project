Break me down
You got a lovely face
We're going to your place
And now you got to freak me out
Scream so loud
Getting fucking laid
You want me to stay
But I got to make my way

Hey!
You're a crazy bitch
But you fuck so good I'm on top of it
When I dream I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on

Hey!
You're a crazy bitch
But you fuck so good I'm on top of it
When I dream I'm doing you all night
Scratches all down my back to keep me right on

Take it off
The paper is your game
