Here, have a dollar,
in fact, no brother-man here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me,
but it means a big deal to you
"Be strong, serve God only,
know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits"
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name,
no one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum,
