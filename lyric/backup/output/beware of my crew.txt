Somebody, somewhere, best beware of my crew(2x)
Comin from the city where no pity is show
And everybody want to be a G when they grown
They send real niggas to the pen and score
Speakin on the ones that's the quickest to dump
Same fools ridin that'z been down for yearz
Cuz that's the shit when they around they peers
Three cheers to the turf for whatever its worth
Cuz I'mma represent till I'm set in the dirt
My mentality, battle the opponent to dip
And checkin every nigga that ever wanted to step
Wit a question fo testin
This action I represent fo inspection
When some jump then I'm dumpin
Pumpin fear in ya ear
When ya hear that I'm bumpin
(Voice box & Nate Dogg)
Somebody, somewhere, best beware of my crew
It's groovy how I sooth thee
And that's just the way I display
Any time a day a duel
Dynamically wit the lyrical tool
Fuel on the fire warms the desire
To get this rap game stretched down to the wire, sire
My pimp-hog status will blast ya seat
From t to the e-c-h-n-i-e-c (Techniec)
Free from all this nonsense, guilt, and shame
They the one's to blame
But what I did been through, seen, and touched
