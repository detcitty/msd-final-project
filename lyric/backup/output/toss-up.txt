Late one night when I was creepin
And the rest of the world was sleepin
I got a beep from a little freak I met
At the mall, yes y'all, she was gettin the call
So I called, said: What's up, what's the deal?
You booty looked real good today
You know I'm ready to lay
(Some pipe) yeah, the N2Deep type
She said: Cool, bring someone from the crew
I said okay, picked up [Name] on my way
I woulda got [Name] but he was with some ho
So it's just me and the dog and we're ready to gee
We picked the girl up and it was plain to see
