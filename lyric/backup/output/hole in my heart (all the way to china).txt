I've got a ticket, no turning back my destination.
The sea of trouble, the land of pain
You're sending me where it always rains
Oh reconsider, I'm begging you, some hesitation
I'm holding on to my sanity
I feel the beginning of emergency
My hands are slipping, Oh please don't let me fall into

This hole in my heart that goes all the way to China
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of.
