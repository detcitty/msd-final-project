Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody being honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, (biiitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a s√©ance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doing well bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal coming in and out
