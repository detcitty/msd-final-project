I said upside down you're turning me
You're giving love instinctively
Around and round you're turning me
Upside down

Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
Upside down

Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
Instinctively you give to me

The love that I need
I cherish the moments with you
Respectfully I say to thee

I'm aware that you're cheating
But no one makes me feel like you do
Upside down
Boy, you turn me

Inside out
And round and round
