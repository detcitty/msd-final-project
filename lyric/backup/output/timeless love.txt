Though we'll never live this moment again
The clock is ticking away in vain
Time itself has chased us down
But we've tricked it at it's own game
Nothing to keep me from you... 

I don't have to see you everyday
Only fools put chains on love
And if I had to live life through
Alone and without you
It wouldn't change a thing...
