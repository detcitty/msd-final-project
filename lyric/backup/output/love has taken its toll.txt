Smoke filled room
Champagne on ice
Bed of roses
But something still ain`t right

Light through my window
Lazy afternoon
I wanna taste the good life
But I`m missing you too soon

(CHORUS)
Take my heart, take my soul
Love has taken it`s toll
I got no feeling, no control
Love has taken it`s toll

I`m halfway around the world
You`re halfway gone
