"Look at the bargains over here, ladies"

If I was your girlfriend, would U remember
2 tell me all the things U forgot when I was your man?
Hey hey, when I was your man

If I was your best friend, would U let me
Take care of U and do all the things that only a best friend can?
Oh, only best friends can

If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend

If I was your girlfriend, would U let me dress U
I mean, help U pick out your clothes before we go out?
Not that U're helpless
But sometime, sometime those are the things that bein' in love's about

If I was your one and only friend
Would U run 2 me if somebody hurt U even if that somebody was me? Yeah
(Even if that somebody was me?)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be ... please!
