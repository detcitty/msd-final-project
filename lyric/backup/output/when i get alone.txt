Oh yeah! (Oooooh) Oh yeah! (Oooooh)

So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I won't ever send
Somehow it is cut so much deeper then they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them be

So let me be and I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killin me (oh yeah)
