I've been down so long, I've been hurt for so long
There were times I thought I'd never see the break of day
It was hard for me to see Your plan for me
And I tried to believe struggling won't last always
 
See night after night, night after night, night after night
I prayed Lord, "Don't take Your joy from me"
And then late one night, then late one night
I read in Your love letter that it's gonna get better
 
Don't You know that I've been looking for You?
I realize nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You

You been so good to us
You brought us from a mighty long way
That's why we love You, come on

When my enemies tried to come for me
And they thought that my world was coming to an end
