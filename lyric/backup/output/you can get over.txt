You can get over
Everybody wants to make the rules
Got to get high [Higher]
You don't wanna be nobody fool

And I believe that somehow
We can be the things we need to be

You can get over
Don't let nobody tell you, you can't fly
Makin' it better [Better]
You can make it if you try

Gonna show you, get up and take your stand
? Cause I know you got the power in your hand
Feel it glowin' in every child, woman, and man
Ooh? ooh?

Ey? hey?
