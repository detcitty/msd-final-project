And I really wanna sex your bodyAnd I really wannaAnd I really wanna sex your body(tonight)
S.e.x your b.o.d.y

I knew from the moment that we met
That I'd be the one who'd get you wet
Cause I can see passion in your eyes
And baby the eyes they never lie

And you be callin me, callin me, callin me, tellin me that your home alone
(oh you know I'm on my way)
