Why don't we both surrender
Before we both get burned
So many shots fired
So many daggers thrown

Can you think of anything
We have learned from all this menace
Have we learned from all this strife
Have we learned from all this business
With the gun and the knife

I throw up my hands for you
And if you throw up your hands for me
What a wonderful world this could be, yeah

I throw up my hands, my hands for you
And if you throw up your hands for me
What a wonderful world this could be, be, be
