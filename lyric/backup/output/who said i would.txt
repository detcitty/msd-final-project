I know she knows she wants me, I hear it every day
And I know she knows she needs me, there ain't no other way
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cos when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would (who said I would)
Now she knows it ain't easy, for a simple boy like me
She filled me full of lovin', oh, baby set me free
