I'm up in Oakland on a Saturday night
Lord, I said I just didn't feel right
Goodnight ladies all around
But the right one hadn't found me such a bad night
I didn't feel right

Then a friend came over 'fore it got too late
Asked me if I'd like you a s double date
My stars above, I fell in love

With queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
Yeah, the queen of the roller derby
(Queen of the roller derby)
