Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride
I hit the road out of nowhere

I had to jump in my car
And be a rider in a love game

Following the stars
Don't need no book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all
She has a train goin' downtown
She's got a club on the moon
But she's tellin' all her secrets
