Bounce, bounce, bounce, Jay-Z,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella, y'all
Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella, y'all
Check, check

Yo, I'm makin' short term goals, when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to Free a big Willy
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly

Shoppin' sprees, copin' three
Deuce fever, IS's fully loaded, hehe, yes
Bouncin' in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like buddha
50 G's to the crap shooter, niggaz can't fade me

Chrome socks beamin' through my peripheral I see ya schemin'
Stop dreamin', I leave your body steamin'
Niggaz is fiendin', what's the meanin'?
I'm leanin' on any nigga intervenin'
With the sound of my money machine-in'

My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and runnin'
Y'all niggas don't want it, I got the Godfather flow
The Don Juan DeMarco, swear to God, don't get it fucked up

I'm takin' out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
'Cause you can't knock the hustle
