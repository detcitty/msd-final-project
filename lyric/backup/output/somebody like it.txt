There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known
I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done
And it sure feels good
To finally feel the way I do

Now I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you

An' I'm lettin' go of all my lonely yesterdays
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made
Now there's just one thing
The only thing I wanna do

I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you

Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine
Shinin' down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
