Well she grabbed me and asked me,
If I had a name,
She told me she was interested to see,
If I could play the game,
She said her name was victory,
She didn't want to know the rules,
That's just the way I wanted to play,
In a game designed for fools.


Chorus:
We were beatin' the odds, we were beatin' the odds,
We were beatin' the odds again,
We were gambling with our souls,
We were playing to win,
