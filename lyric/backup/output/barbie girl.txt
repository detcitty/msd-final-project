Hi Barbie
Hi Ken!
Do you wanna go for a ride?
Sure Ken!
Jump In

I'm a barbie girl
In the barbie world
Life in plastic
It's fantastic!

You can brush my hair
Undress me everywhere
Imagination
Life is your creation

Come on Barbie
Let's go party!

I'm a barbie girl
In the barbie world

Life in plastic

It's fantastic!
You can brush my hair
Undress me everywhere
Imagination

Life is your creation

I'm a blond bimbo girl
In the fantasy world
Dress me up
Make it tight
I'm your dolly
You're my doll

Rock'n'roll
Feel the glamour in pink
Kiss me here
Touch me there
