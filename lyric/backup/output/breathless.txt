Go on
Leave me breathless
Come on
The daylight's fading slowly
But time with you is standing still
I'm waiting for you only
The slightest touch and I feel weak

I cannot lie
From you I cannot hide
And I'm losing the will to try it
Can't hide it
Can't fight it

So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
