I'm meetin' my buddies out on the lake
We're headed out to a special place we love
That just a few folks know

There's no signin' up, no monthly dues
Take your Johnson, your Mercury
Or your Evinrude an' fire it up
Meet us out at party cove

Come on in the water's fine
Just idle on over an' toss us a line

Bass-trackers, Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
