Yo, once the Mo start drippin' hoes start trippin'
Tell 'em my name Boo you know we all hittin'
But look mami I got 3 drinks in me stuck
And I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna fuck

If the pussy gets wetter chicks, I never sweat her
I'm gettin' all the cheddar bitch, read the letter
I patterned the plan get a dick suck wit a gat in my hand
Bitch, it's thug passion chicks drive by in their whips

They be flashin', "Do you know Bonic and Lib?"
They be askin', if the bitch wanna ask me shit, I'ma hit
Attitude just like Cancun, I'ma trip
Now niggas pissed know why? 'Cause I'm the shit

If you cop a 5, imagine
What I'm gone get lights out
Most wanted bring the bikes out ball out
Bitches on the back ass all out

I got hoes wit accents and I don't mean Hyundai's
My hands touched more bricks than Quamay's
Ice'll blind you for real dog, believe me
Only feel comfortable around Ray Charles and Stevie
So I'ma take it easy

So why don't you run across the border mama?
(I'll run cross the border papa)
And what will you bring me back mama?
(You know what I'll bring you back papa)
Don't forget
(I won't forget)
To bring me back
(To bring you back)

What I need
(What you need)
Tonight
(Tonight)
Will you run across the border mama?
