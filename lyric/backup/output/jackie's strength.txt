A Jackie, a-Jackie, a-Jackie's strength
A Jackie, a-Jackie, a-Jackie, hey

A Bouvier till her wedding day
Shots rang out the police came
Mama laid me on the front lawn
And prayed for Jackie's strength

Feeling old by twenty one
Never thought my day would come
My bridesmaid's getting laid
I pray for Jackie's strength

Make me laugh, say you know what you want
You said we were the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn
