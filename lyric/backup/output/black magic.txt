All the girls on the block knocking at my door
Wanna know what it is, make the boys want more

Is your lover
playing on your side?
Said he loves you
But he ain't got time
Here's the answer
Come and get it
At a knocked down price

(Hey!)

Full of honey
Just to make him sweet
Crystal balling
Just to help him see
What he's been missing
So come and get it
While you've still got time

(Hey!)

Get your boy on his knees
And repeat after me, say

Take a sip of my secret potion
I'll make you fall in love
For a spell that can't be broken
One drop should be enough
Boy, you belong to me
I got the recipe and it's called Black Magic
