An automatic alarm
Turns my radio on
Before my feet can hit the floor
The music's got me ready to go
And all through the whole day
I know my favourite records they'll play
It helps me chase all my blues away
When I can hear that DJ say that this is station

H.A.P.P.Y.
We plan to help your day go by
I said it's a Musical, natural high
H.A.P.P.Y.
We plan to help your day go by
I said it's a Musical, natural high

You should hear them
Everyday yeah

While riding home in my car
My happy radio is never too far
I just reach out my hand turn the dial
And I know it will make me smile
