Lying here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
Caught up in your smile

I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
