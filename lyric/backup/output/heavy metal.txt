Drive it on up and let's cruise a while
Leave 'em very far behind
You can hedge your bet on a clean corvette
To get you there right on time
Now if you're ready to dive into overdrive
Baby the green lights are on
It's like you're runnin away on some high octane
Every time she reached the boulevard

Won't you take a ride, ride, ride
On heavy metal
