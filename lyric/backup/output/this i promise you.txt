When the visions around you, bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you, are secrets and lies
I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope
Keeping your faith when it's gone
The one you should call, was standing here all along
And I will take, you in my arms, and hold you right where you belong
Till the day my life is through, this I promise you
