Here now, don't make a sound
Say, have you heard the news today?
One flag was taken down
To raise another in its place

A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unchanged
No harm, no life, no love
No stranger singin' in your name

But maybe the season
The colours change in the valley skies
Dear God, I've sealed my fate
Runnin' through hell, heaven can wait

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
