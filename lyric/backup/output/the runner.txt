Through the night, through the dawn
Behind you another runner is born
Don't look back
You've been there
See the mist as your breath hits the air

And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum

Through the night, through the dawn
Behind you another runner is born
Don't look back
You've been there
Feel the mist as your breath hits the air

And it's underneath the moonlight, passing some
Still your heart beats in the moonlight, like a drum

And you will run your time
A shooting star across the sky
And you will surely cross the line
