People are talking, talking 'bout people
...
I hear them whisper, you won't believe it
They think we're lovers kept under cover
I just ignore it but they keep saying we
...
Laugh just a little too loud (a little too loud)
Stand just a little too close (too close)

We stare just a little too long
...
Maybe they're seein' something we don't, darling
...
Let's give 'em something to talk about

(Something to talk about)
