Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army green
Sat down in a booth in a caf√© there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me, I'm feeling a little lonely
She said I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care
I've got no one to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you?

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
