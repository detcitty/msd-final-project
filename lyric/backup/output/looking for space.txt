On the road of experience,
I'm trying to find my own way.
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away.
When I think that I'm moving,
Suddenly things stand still.
I'm afraid 'cause I think they alway will.

And I'm looking for space,
And to find out who I am.
And I'm looking to know and understand.
It's a sweet, sweet dream.
Sometimes I'm almost there.
