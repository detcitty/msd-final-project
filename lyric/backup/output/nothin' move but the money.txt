 aha aha yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Keep it movin' come on and keep it movin' [X4] 
 
 Verse 1: [Mic] 
 Tint that shine full us to the teeth 
 ask yourself can you ball like me 
 it's nothin that an amature can try to see 
 even hoes with the most step carefully around me 
 I bribe by the rules you know 
 disturb my groove and you gots to lay low 
 Geronimo have it in the cut hawked up 
 fucked up steering the gas from both sides 
 I stay high Puffy pie in the soar 
 spearing the dough, accordly we run it, 
 how it go? Can't nobody hold me down 
 like my nigga Puff say, cut so sharp, you 
 think we sensay(sh)?, Ima break it down audio display 
 with some help from the Bad Boys mic on the play 
 frontin' on my crew nigga crime don't pay 
 we're back in ya face kickin' dirt all day 
 Virgin niggas can't rhyme, don't try 
 it's a fact, you've been hitted by the Master-I
