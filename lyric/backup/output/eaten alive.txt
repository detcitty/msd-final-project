Animal stalking you at night
I'm a sucker for someone
And I got the prey in sight
Lying on a bed of leaves
In the modern times
You forget and let your spirit breathe

Capture me my blood is red
Another victim of your ritual
For you my skin is shed
Ecstacy ain't what you find
In the modern world
One flick of my tongue changes
The meaning of the world
And you say

That's impossible
That's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be

I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
