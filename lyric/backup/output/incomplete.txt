OoOoOoOh, uh, oh yeah

Listen
Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
I got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now
Pretty faces from the covers of a magazine
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and Fortune still can't find,
Just a grown man running out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl,
