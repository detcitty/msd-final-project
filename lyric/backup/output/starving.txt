You know just what to say, things that scare me
I should just walk away, but I can't move my feet
The more that I know you, the more that I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday

I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
