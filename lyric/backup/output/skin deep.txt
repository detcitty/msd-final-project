You came on to me a house of fire
One look was all it took for my desire
I'm still burnin'
It's the middle of the night
I need somethin'
That can make me feel alright as I go

Skin deep, to the bone
Every time I see your face
Skin deep, to the bone
Tellin' me that I'm in trouble
S.O.S.
I'm in distress, tonight
