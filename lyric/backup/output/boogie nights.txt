Boogie nights, whoa
Boogie nights, whoa

ain't no doubt we are here to party
(Boogie nights) come on now got to get it started
Dance with the boogie get down
(Dance with the boogie get down)
'Cause boogie nights are always the best in town

Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing
Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing

get that groove let it take you higher
(Boogie nights) make it move set this place on fire
Dance with the boogie get down
(Dance with the boogie get down)
'Cause boogie nights are always the best in town

Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing
Got to keep on dancing, keep on dancing
