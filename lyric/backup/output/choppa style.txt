Yo Choppa, this P
I'm Uptown right now
I'm on my way to the Westbank to put a twist on this thing ya heard?

Ooww! Oh Yea!
Ooww! Oh Yea!
Ooww! Oh Yea!
Ooowww!
Who they want?
Choppa style, chop chop Choppa style
Choppa style, chop chop
She want chop chop
She love chop chop
She want chop chop
They love chop chop

Now I don't mean to sound rude baby or hurt you or nothing
I want an independant woman if she workin' with something
I want a slim, fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got a lot of ass but I can work with her
Want a big fine woman with some pop in her
She ain't got a lot of ass but titty bop with her
Now I came here to get it bump
Represent for No Limit if you ain't with it catch a dump
Now kneel it up, in the truck you know what's up
We just signed with Universal and we got the clubs up
So put your head between your legs and touch your toes
Bounce your booty up and down ooh girl there you go
Won't you walk like a?
If you an independant woman maybe I'mma holla
You got your hair fixed nice with your clothes tight
You wanna shake it like a dog and do it all night, all night
Now swoop in position and get it right
Put your hands in the air won't you make those titties fight?
