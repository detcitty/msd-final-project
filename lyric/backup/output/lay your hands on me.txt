This old life seemed much too long
With little point in going on
I couldn't think of what to say
Words just vanished in a haze
I was feeling cold and tired
Yeah, kinda sad and uninspired

When it almost seemed too much
I see your face and sense the grace
And feel the magic in your touch

Oh, lay your hands
Lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands (woo hoo)
Oh, lay your hands
Oh, lay your hands on me
Oh, lay your hands
