Hey!
She's freaky, and she knows it
She's freaky, and I like it

Listen

She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be going home with me tonight

She looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's going home with me tonight

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky, and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it

She shuts the room down
