My heart's a stereo
It beats for your, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Gym Class Heroes, baby
If I was just another dusty record on the shelve
Will you blow me off and play me like everybody else
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for make skipping tracks
This the last girl that play me, left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to used to, now I'm over that
Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I sing a song and the image grab you by the head
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
