Cigarettes
And tiny liquor bottles
Just what you'd expect
Inside her new Balenciaga
Viral mess
Turned dreams into an empire
Self-made success now she rolls with Rockafellers

Survival of the richest
The city's ours until the fall
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound
But we don't feel like outsiders at all

We are the new Americana
