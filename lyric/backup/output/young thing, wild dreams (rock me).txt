Young thing, young thing
Your blade is ripe
Walk out with a fever
In the night

Young thing, young thing
(With) your fist so fat
Forget about that
Come on out and move me

Move me, move me
Let your spirit ring
Rock me
'Til I can't think

Young thing, young thing
Is your world so flat
Drive out to the edges
Drive it all back

Young thing, young thing
When they lock you inside
Slip out the back
Come on and move me
