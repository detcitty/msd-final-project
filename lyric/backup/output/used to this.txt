Zaytoven

Mexicano, working like I'm Mexicano
New persona, we're moving on from Ferragamo (I'm moving on)
Get the llama, I party with the real Madonna (yeah)
Beat the odds, do numbers and remain humble (Future)
Drop top Porsches, I'm so used to this
Smoking out the pound, I'm so used to this
I know where I'm from and I got used to this
Mansion in the hills, I got used to this

Shake your booty bitches, I got used to this
There's Iceland in my wrist, I done got used to this
Tropicana bitches, I got all kinda flavors
Selling dope all my life, I can't do minimum wage (nah)
Dirty-dirty muddy, I got used to this (gang)
I give you my heart till there ain't nothing to give (Future)
