Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Look... I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
