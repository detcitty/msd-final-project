Baby, since you've been gone
I've been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me, I guess I'm all messed up, now baby

As soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on, on the radio
And there you are baby once again

It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
