For so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you is more than strong, girl
Take it from me
If you give a little more than you're asking for
Your love will turn the key
Darling mine
I would wait forever for those lips of wine
Build my world around you, darling
This love will shine girl
