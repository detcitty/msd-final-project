Burning up, my heart is like burnin' up
Burning up, my heart is like burnin' up
Burning up, my heart is like burnin' up
Burning up, my heart is like burnin' up

Sometimes you can be in love and having fun
And still not know what's goin' on
Or on the other hand you separate
Thinking that the feelin's gone
