Yeah, yeah

I can tell you've been hurt
By that look on your face, girl
Some guy brought sad
Into your happy world

You need love, but you're
Afraid that if you give in
Someone else will come along
And sock it to you again

One bad apple don't
Spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, give it one more try
Before you give up on love

One bad apple don't
Spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard
