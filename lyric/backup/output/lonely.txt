Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely

Yo! This one here
Goes out to all my players out there man, ya know
That got that one good girl who's always been there man, like

Took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave...
Yeah
I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreaming, for her I was feenin
so I had to take a little ride

back tracking over these few years
tryna figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so
Lonely (2: so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
