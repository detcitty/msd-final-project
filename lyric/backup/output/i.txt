Is this mic on?
Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up!
I want the mic
We bringing up nobody-nobody-nobody
But the number one rapper in the world
He done travelled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All the little boys and girls, come up here
This for you, come on up
Kendrick, come on

I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the bully
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

And when they say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line full of fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme yup
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front, yeah)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker, I smile

(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, ahh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the bully
(I love myself)
