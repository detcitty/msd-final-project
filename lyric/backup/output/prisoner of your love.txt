Somethings got a hold on me something deep inside.
I know that I should try to run but I feel my hands are tied.
I don't know where you came from, but you found your way to me.
I don't even want to be set free.

Woman black as coal sister to the night, 
Stroke my body touch my soul make me feel alright
I don't know just what you want, but you got your mark on me
It's become so very plain to see
