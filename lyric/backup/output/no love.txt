Love
Love
Love
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more

Young Money, yeah
Uh, throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world"
Get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but y'know nothing about her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay them down, make 'em beg
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down
I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on a triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"
I'm high as a bitch
Up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in a cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peep-hole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just
Don't hurt me
That's right bitch
Don't hurt me
And I don't need you
No more
Don't want to see you
No more
Ha, bitch you get
No love
