[Intro:]
[Xzibit]
Yeah
Time to bring your ass to the table y'all
It's X to the Z, Xzibit
Snoop double G, uh O.G (Westcoast, Los Angeles)
Uh, bring it live, Dr. Dre
What
Throwin' up a big ass W
Coverin' up the world, right
Yeah, listen, look

[Verse 1:]
[Xzibit]
You ain't try to high box with me
I'm swing hard liquor
Goin' down by the second round
All for the underground
Hideout sound
Xzibit mackin' down for my conflict
Fuck the nonsense, terrorist
Hit a bomb shit
Blast with metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why Niggas promise keep on steppin'
Xzibit ready to scrap
Like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5, minimum wage
What type of lights is that for me
It not for me
You fuckin' round with the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You outta your destiny
You don't wanna tango with the X,
strangle your neck
slap like the opposite sex
Drunk drivin' tryin' to stack my loot
While other rappers gettin' treated like a prostitute
