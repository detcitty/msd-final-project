Well, I been havin a little trouble lord
But I'm keepin it together yeah
My baby just walked out the doors
She said this time forever

It ain't the first time baby
Baby it wont be the last
I'd better get the boys round
And do some drinkin fast

Cause she's gone, gone, gone
I don't know if I'm happy
