Come to me and cry
I know, I know, I know it's not easy
Your heart is aching
But so is mine
But so is mine
How can I tell you

Why
For so long, so long, so long
I've been thinking
Now I know
I can't live a lie
Can't live a lie

They say true love lasts forever

If we want it
There will be waiting
A second chance
Baby but now we need time
Time to learn
