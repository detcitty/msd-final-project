Yeah, yeah, yeah
We all my
Yeah
C'mon, c'mon, uh
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uh
To all my niggas that be livin' it up, we say
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, ah
C'mon

Baby, you're such a typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, I'ma fuck, you tonight thing
Fuck, knowing your name, get your ass in the Range
And rollover, gettin' blown while blowing the doja
Bring head to a closure
That's a good bitch
Before it's all over, I'ma leave this bitch
Probably treat this bitch, smoke better
'Cause if you ain't know, gangstas and hoes go together
Poppin' my collar, partna
Who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot
In the mug and the watch, love me
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me 'cause they ain't fucked me
And they say I'm lucky
Do you think I've got time to fuck all these hoes?
And do all these shows?
Or flight in the lama, Dodge and White Rolls
Uh-oh, another episode

What, do I do?
To all my niggas that be livin' it up, we say
What, I do
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uhh
What, you do
To all my niggas that be livin' it up, we say
What, do I do?
