How can I convince you
What you see is real
Who am I to blame you
For doubting what you feel

I was always reachin'
You were just a girl I knew
I took for granted
The friend I had in you
I was living for a dream

Loving for a moment
Taking on the world
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
