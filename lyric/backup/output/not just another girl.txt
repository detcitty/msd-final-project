The place was jammed, the music loud
I could see her face standing out in the crowd as she winked at me
Feeling good I didn't care
All I could see was her standing there
See the crowd got up, the band was playing
And in my mind I could hear her saying, I love you

She could have been from anywhere
She could have had most anyone
I bet the girls in another world
Not just another girl
