There's a black man with a black cat
Livin' in a black neighborhood
He's got an interstate runnin' through his front yard
You know he thinks he's got it so good
And there's a woman in the kitchen
Cleanin' up the evenin' slop
And he looks at her and says, "Hey darlin', I can remember when
You could stop a clock"

Ah, but ain't that America for you and me?
Ain't that America? Somethin' to see, baby
Ain't that America? Home of the free, yeah
Little pink houses for you and me
