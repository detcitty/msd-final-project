(Richie McDonald/Frank Myers/Don Pfrimmer)

Well, I roll into town
With the ragtop down
I was looking for the homecoming queen
That three-by-nine lit hotel sign read
Welcome back Class of '83
There were football guys twice their size
Cheerleaders hiding the grey in their hair
The names were the same but the faces had changed
I didn't recognize anyone there.
