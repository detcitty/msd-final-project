I wanna see y'all, who wanna plan with me
Wave your hands across the land if we family
Say hot-damn, hot-damn, we wanna jamboree
This for my peeps here, I stand for you 'cause you stand for me

C'mon I know I jam, I know I jam jam, while oh damn
I know I jam, I know I jam jam boree
I know I jam, I know I jam jam
Well oh damn, why don't you jamboree for me?
Yes, indeed

Kaboom kaboom, the platoon came on in eight limbs and timbs
Broke rims, smoked sims, whoop dogs with bent rims
For the real and the raw, from who'd up with the law
I never kill for the thrill, but I cut for the cars
Smokin' buddha with a hoota', get better prices from looters
Shake my shell with the shooters, leed a luga with duga
Some say modelin' and acting mean treach is selling

While I'm yelling, first a felon with my gat at ya melon
Hella heated, too ill for them to beat it
Most cheated, most weeded, most needed, you best believe it
Let's take the tapes jam for me, stand for me
You're damned to be without the Jamboree
