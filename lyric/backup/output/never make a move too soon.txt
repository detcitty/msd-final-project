Three days of snow in Birmingham
Thought you would wonder where I am
Rang our number all night long
It's no comfort on the telephone
Ran out and caught a midnight flight
Thought a little love would make everything all right
The landlord said you moved away
And left me all your bills to pay
Look out baby, you might have made your move too soon

Left me with a Keno card
