Oh-no-no
Ah
Whoa
It's late at night I can't fall asleep

Shadows on the lake are obsolete
So I just stay awake
Images running 'round my brain
Paint your picture you're the king of the walk

Declare your space and prepare to shock
There is no precedence
Alone in your room your first offence
So I turn surprised, (o-o)

Reflections from behind
And I gaze to the sublime, (o-o)
Said na na na na na na

Dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)
Dancin' bring me nearer to you
Dancin' with my mirror, (my mirror)
