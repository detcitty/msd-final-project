(Mr. Magic Intro)
B-Doctor!
Let's welcome em to the Vault baby
Do it big nigga!
Do it big nigga!
Do it big nigga!
Stupid ass nigga
(Chorus: Magic Repeat 2x)
I smoke (Yea!), I drank (Yea!)
I'm supposed to stop but I can't (Uh-huh)
I'ma dog (Yea!), I love hoes (Yea!)
And I'm addicted to money, cars and clothes
Do it big then

I do it big nigga (3x)

(Verse 1: Young Bleed)
So many ways to get paid
Better, keep, fake, i.d.
Sure yall don't try me
It's murder, I'm a server
Lyric life sentence
Relentless, a menace to society
Full of robberies so **** it
I hop in the bubble
Wrap the Beretta wit a rag
That glock in the Cutlass
Nigga I'm always hustlin
And yea, round the Cadillacs
The alibam's a must (Uh-huh, yea yea)
Crimey and grimey weed smuckers (Uh-huh, yea yea)
Money and weed, you know my mind see on the Don Don P
With Mr. Magic and Traffic blowin some bomb weed (Uh-huh, yea yea)
