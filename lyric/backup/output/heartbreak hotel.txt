Live in sin
Ten years ago on this day my heart was yearning
I promise I would never ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning

As we walked to the room, there were faces starring
Glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scarring me

We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom
There were two girls sitting in my room
She walked up to my face, said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
