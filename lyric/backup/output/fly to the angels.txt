Pictures of you
Oh they're still on my mind
You had this smile
That could light up the world
Now when it rains it seems
The sun never shines

And I drive
Down this lonely, lonely road
Oh I got this feelin'
Girl I gotta let you go

Cause now you've to fly (fly high)
Fly to the angels
Heaven awaits your heart
And flowers bloom in your name
Woahh oh
You've got to fly (fly high),
Fly to the angels
All the stars in the night
