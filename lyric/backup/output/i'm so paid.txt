Rubbin' on that Italian leather
Konvict Jeans on
Ay yo Weezy, you ready?
Yeah!

I get it in 'til the sun rise
Goin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Hey-ey-ey, I'm so paid

Number one hustler gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustler and don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

I see police on that crooked, I
Doin' 100 on Interstate 95
My shorty leanin', blastin' that 'Do Or Die'
Wishin' that a motherfucker would, 'cause we certified

Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hope they never call off
I'm a sniper sittin' on the roof, already saw y'all

Ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
