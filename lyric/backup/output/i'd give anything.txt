I'm waiting
For someone who could turn my life
around
Someone who could make me feel
The way I used to feel
But she never comes

I'm searching
But there's no one that I'd care to talk
about
And all the lovers in the world
Don't amount to much
'Cause what I want is just one love

And I'd give anything
And everything
To fall in love
Just this one time
