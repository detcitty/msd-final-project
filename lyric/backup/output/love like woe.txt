Woe oh, oh, oh!
Woe oh, oh, oh!
I gotta feel like it don't make, like it don't make
Feel like it don't make sense
I'm thinking baby you and I are undeniable
But I'm finding now love's unreliable
I'm given all I got to make you stay
Or am I just a roadblock in your way?

'Cause your a pretty little windstorm
On the boulevard
Something like a sunset
Oh yeah a shooting star
And I might drive myself insane
If those lips start speaking my name

'Cause I got some intuition
Or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction
You got me on a mission
Tell me darling can I get a break, somehow?
Can I say no?

She's got a love like woe (Woe oh oh oh)
Girl's got a love like woe (Woe oh oh oh)
(Ba da da)
I gotta feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in
And now you're kicking me out again
