This ain't no place for losers
Or the innocent of mind
It's a full time job
For anyone, to stay alive
The streets have shallow boundaries
For the war that's everyone
What a wasteland for
Broken dreams and hired guns
Shelter me, baby shelter me
When I'm sitting like I'm losing ground
Shelter me
I've gone to sleep
But when I open
The other goes my tears
