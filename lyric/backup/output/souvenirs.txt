Souvenirs are signs that take you away
Souvenirs will make you leave here today
For a world of joy and living
A world of love and giving away, far away

Souvenirs are signs that take me away
Souvenirs will make me leave here today
For a world of joy and living
A world of love and giving away, far away

'Cause all we need is a world of dreams
Forgotten feelings come back in streams
Come join us. Don't hesitate
Just be yourself, be free, let's be free
