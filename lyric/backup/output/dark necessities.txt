Coming on to the light of day
We got many moons that are deep at play
So I keep an eye on the shadow smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
What do you say?
Spinning Knot that is on my heart
Is like a bit of light in a touch of dark
You got sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
What do you say?
