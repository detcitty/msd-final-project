Featuring Brothers Johnson

Hey, oh, oh...

Well, the first time I saw you
Was the first time I lost you
And the first time I kissed you
Was the first time I missed you

There were times when we tried
To get by with some love too
But the things that we went through
Were so cold, don't let me remind you

It takes one to be alone
