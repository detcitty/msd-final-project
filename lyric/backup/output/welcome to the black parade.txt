When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Would you be the saviour of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"

He said, "Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?"
"Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join The Black Parade"

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Would you be the saviour of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know
