I've been looking for a driver who's qualified
So if you think that you're the one
Step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic

Speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean
So if you feel me let me know
Know, know

Come on now what you waiting for
For, for
My engine's ready to explode
Explode, explode

So start me up and watch me go
Go, go, go

Got you where you wanna go
If you know what I mean

Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves?

Can you run all the lights?
If you can baby boy
Then we can go all night
'Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five

Baby you got the keys
Now shut up and drive
