Ooh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

I need a love
I need a sweet sensual love
(All right) I need a love
(This here natural love)
I need a sweet sensual love

Well, it seems suddenly
I've been overtaken
By the one thing
I've been calling for
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

Fools love is so full of heartache
I'll play it cool
Let it happen naturally
Ooh, whoa, oh, oh

I need a love
I need a sweet sensual love
(My love) I need a love
(This here natural love)
I need a sweet sensual love
