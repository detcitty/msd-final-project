Now as the summer fades I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you, find you, find you
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you, right behind you

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
