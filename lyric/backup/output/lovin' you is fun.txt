You got a cousin who's tellin' you somethin'
That doesn't have nothin' to do with the loving that we're in, baby
I hear she's sayin' this game we're playin' should be complicated
If you won't, I'll say it, I think she's crazy 'cause

Love don't have to be a bunch of drama
A bunch of knock down, drag outs, cryin' in the rain
