You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the keys under the mat
Childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind

Go to church cause your mama says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be a waste of time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door say please say thank you
Don't steal don't cheat and don't lie
