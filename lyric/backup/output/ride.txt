Chyeah, Ace Hood
See mama, all I want you to do is hold it down for me
I want you to be my ride or die
While I go get this money, I promise I'ma get us out the hood baby

Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
And when I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Cuz I ride or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride or die we gon' make it out this hood

Listen, baby look, just ride with me
Swear that I got us mama
One thing I love about it
See you ain't wit that drama

You be my ride or die like Bonnie I'mma play the Clyde
Promise to move you out the hood into a bigger house
That's why you never trip I'm grindin' bump a 9-5
Gotta get this money, paper callin' but you never whine
Gotta ask the cash come with bags you should see your eyes
That's why I surprise about you stacks to ease your worried mind
