Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nail done, hair done, everything did
Nail done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nail done, hair done, everything did
Nail done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?

You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you’re the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nail done, hair done, everything did
Nail done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
