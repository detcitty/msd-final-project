Flyin' high on a feelin'
Flyin' high
Flyin' high on a good thing
Flyin' high on your love

I knew we could make it from the beginning
The first time I saw you passing by, whoa
To me it was much more than a notion
It was the fire in your eyes

Flyin' high on a feelin'
Flyin' high
Flyin' high on a good thing
Flyin' high on your love

Your face has a glow, girl, like a sunrise
