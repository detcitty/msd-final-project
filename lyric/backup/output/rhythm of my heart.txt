Across the street, the river runs
Down in the gutter, life is slipping away
Love may still exist in another place
Running undercover of a helicopter blade
The flames are getting higher in effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere, some day
Where they're downing only deer
A hundred steel towns away

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words "I love you"
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
