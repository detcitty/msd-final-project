Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion
Love to hear it

Blow horns you sure sound pretty
Your violins keep movin' to the nitty gritty
When you hear the scratch of the guitars scratchin'
Then you'll know that rhythm carries all the action, woah

Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion
Love to hear it

Got to hear it

Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Move your feet when you feel the beat
Turn it upside down
