The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

'Cause you are my lady
And I'm your man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
