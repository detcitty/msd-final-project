Baby come on over tonight, we can make it all right
Take a piece of my heart and go from the start

You say that you want me, again and again
You say that you need me to be more than just you're friend
So I thought about it and may be you're right
I've been checking your records and they seem all right

Baby come on over tonight, we can make it all right
Take a piece of my heart and go from the start
