She's watching the taxi driver, he pulls away
She's been locked up inside her apartment a hundred days

She says, "Yeah, he's still coming, just a little bit late
He got stuck at the laundromat washing his cape
She's just watching the clouds roll by and they spell her name like Lois Lane
And she smiles, oh the way she smiles

She's talking to angels, counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
She's dancing with strangers, falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
