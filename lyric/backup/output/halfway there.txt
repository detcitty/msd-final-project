If we never flew
We would never fall
If the world was ours
We would have it all
But the life we live
Isn't so simplistic
You just don't get what you want

So we take what comes
And we keep on going
Leaning on each other's shoulders
Then we turn around
And see we've come so far somehow

We're halfway there
We're looking good now
Nothing's gonna get in the way
We're halfway there
And looking back now
