Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you
Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless sumkmer nights

Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say it, say it again
I love you always forever

Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
Say it, say it again
I love you always forever

Near or far, closer together
