Oh-no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart
Yeah
Oh-no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart.
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby? (Love love love love)
In love baby?
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby? (Love love love love)
In love baby?
Girl you know you got me, got me
With your pistol shot me, shot me

And I'm here helplessly
In love and nothing can stop me
It can't stop me once I started
Can't return me once you bought it
I'm coming baby don't doubt it
Don't make me wait
So let's be about it.
Oh-no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart.

Baby have some trustin' trustin'
When I come with lustin' lustin'

Cause I bring you that comfort
I ain't only here cause I want your
Body, I want your mind too
