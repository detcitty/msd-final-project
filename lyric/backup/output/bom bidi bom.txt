I was wrong and you were right
If I was yours and you were mine
But it was all good (yeah)
You were gone and I was back
And I was good and you were bad
But it was all good

'Cause I'm an addict, I'm your patient
Your lips are the medication
Come here baby, yeah, you know just what I want
You got that

Bom bidi bom bom bom bom bom
Bom bidi bom bom
You give me bad bad love
But I love it baby
Love me all night long
If you want baby, like
Bom bidi bom bom bom bom bom
Bom bidi bom bom bom
'Cause you're a bad bad girl
But I love it baby
Love me all night long
If you want baby, yeah
Bom bodi bom bode bode bom bom
Bom bodi bom bode bode bom bom
