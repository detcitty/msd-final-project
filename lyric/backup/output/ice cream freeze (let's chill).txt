Everybody do your dance
Ain't nothing better than an all night jam
Are you ready for a little something new tonight
I got a brand new step that you're gonna like
Cmon boys

Gotta do like I do
Just follow my lead

Everybody let's chill

Do the ice cream freeze
Strike your pose
then you do the milk shake
Shake it, Shake it down low
Do the snow cone slide
Left to right
Put your hands in the air
We can party all night

Do the ice cream freeze
Strike your pose
then you do the milk shake
