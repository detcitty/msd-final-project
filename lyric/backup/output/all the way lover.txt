Like a moth to a flame
Burned by the fire
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire?
That's the way love goes

Like a moth to a flame
Burned by the fire
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire?

Like a moth to a flame
Burned by the fire
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire
That's the way love goes

Like a moth to a flame
Burned by the fire
That's the way love goes
My love is blind
Can't you see my desire?
