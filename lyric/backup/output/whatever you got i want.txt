Whatever you got, I want
Whatever you want, I'll give to you
Whatever you got, I want
Whatever it takes I'm willing to do girl

Your eyes speak, your walk is rhythm in motion, hmm
You're too hot to handle, you're full of emotion, girl
My pride's weak I can tell I'm standing in line again yeah
When you pass by, guys double take It's a crime, yeah

Where there's a will there's a way
Even with the games you play
