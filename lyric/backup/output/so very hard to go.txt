Ain't nothin' I can say
Nothin' I can do
I feel so bad, yeah
I feel so blue
I got to make it right
For everyone concerned
Even if it's me, if it means, just me
Wants getting back

'Cause I can never make you unhappy
No, I couldn't do that, love
Only wish I didn't love you so
Makes it so, so very hard to go
