Why dont I like the girl I see
The one whos standing right in front of me
Why dont I think before I speak

I should have listened to that voice inside me
I must be stupid, must be crazy, must be out of my mind
To say the kind of things I said last night
Mirror mirror hanging on the wall

You dont have to tell me whos the biggest fool of all
Mirror mirror I wish you could lie to me
And bring my baby back, bring my baby back to me
(Mirror mirror lie to me
