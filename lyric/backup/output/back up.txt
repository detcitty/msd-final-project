Back up off me, back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me

Yah yah bitch, back up off me
You don't know me, I'm too clean, I'm too holy, bitch I'm godly
I only go for real niggas who don't brag 'bout what they bought me
Cause they know I got a bag, gotta fuck me up some commas
If I fuck and make you cum, you got to promise not to stress me
Don't be blowin' up my phone and don't be leavin' voice messages
Said "I can do you right, do you better than your exes"
I told that nigga to stop it, he was talkin' out his necklace
See the difference with me, I never needed niggas, ever
I'll leave 'em where I met 'em, I ain't trippin' off no, ever
Goons in the cut try to talk you out your necklace
If you ever disrespect me, pussy, don't be disrespectful
I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know
He heard about me, he was waitin' on me at the door
I said woo, yeah that mink all on the floor
Used to bust this shit at skatin', 6 to 9, come in at 4
We got glow sticks for you ho chicks, bitch don't act like you don't know this
I'm very antisocial, social network ain't my motion (I don't move like that)
I show no emotions, nigga's bitches it's disgustin'

Bananas with the Trojans, pop that pussy for a legend
