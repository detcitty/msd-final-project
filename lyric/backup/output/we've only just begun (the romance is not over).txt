We've only just begun, the romance is not over
Gotta lot, a lot of love to give
We've only just begun, the romance is not over
I got so much love to give

I remember oh so well
When I first held your hand and we started to dance
I had this awesome crush on you
Hoping deep down inside that you wanted me too

And now we're here together
Preparing ourselves for the future, yeah
'Cause there's so much that we can do
Oh girl, let me show you

We've only just begun, the romance is not over
Gotta a lot, a lot, a lot of love to give
(To give)
We've only just begun, the romance is not over
