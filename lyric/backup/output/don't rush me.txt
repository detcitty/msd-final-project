Red roses, temptation
You make the most of an ify situation
I'm weighing my decision
Who's to say if it's love, or if it isn't?

Only time will tell
Just how well I'll get to know you
Don't mean to lead you on
But I want to take it slowly, slowly

So don't rush me
I've made that mistake before
And don't rush me
This love could be so much more
It's well worth the waiting for

Desire can mean danger
