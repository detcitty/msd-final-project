Feeling bluesy, you know you do confuse me all night
I sit at home alone and wonder if you're all right
I count the hours and lie awake until you return
And search my mind with overtime, I've so much to learn

Well I gave you everything from the depths of my heart
From the day you took my ring we drifted apart
I have one thing more to say
You're driving me out of my mind
