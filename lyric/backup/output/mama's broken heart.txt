I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name â€˜til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next all I know, I couldn't stop

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the I can hear her now sayin' she ain't gonna have it

Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look
