Blonde hair blowin' in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playin' in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, "Ain't we all just runaways? We got time"
But that ain't much
We can't wait 'til tomorrow
You gotta know that this is real, baby, why you wanna fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
