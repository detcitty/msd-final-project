Yeah Yeah Yeah

Tried to make it little by little,
tried to make it bit by bit on my own.

Quit the job,
the grey believers,
another town where I get close to the bone.

What you gonna tell your brother?
Oh Oh Oh
What you gonna tell your father?
I don't know!
What you gonna tell your mother?
Let me go...

I'm gonna get dressed for success,
shaping me up for the big time, baby.
Get dressed for success,
shaping it up for your love
