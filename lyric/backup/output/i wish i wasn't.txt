1st VERSE

Im home alone again
And you're out, hanging with your friends
So you say, somehow I know its not quite that way
Its getting pretty late, and you havent checked on me all day
When I called, you didn't answer
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me
I wish, that you were home, holding me tight in your arms
I wish, I could go back, to the day before we met and skip my regret

CHORUS
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No you dont deserve me
