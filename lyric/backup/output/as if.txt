Ooh yeah

I love the way you wear those worn out blue jeans
Walkin' all around in the big sunshine
Baby let me believe that you're perfect
At least for a little while

You don't have to tell me what you're thinkin'
You can keep all that to yourself
Baby we got such a good thing going
Don't show me that you're someone else

{Chorus}
Cause I'm acting as if
this blue sky's never gonna rain down on me
