She wants her nails painted black
She wants the toy in the cracker jack
She wants to ride the bull at the rodeo
She wants to wear my shirt to bed
She wants to make every stray a pet
And drive around in my truck with no place to go

But she needs to feel that fire
The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more
