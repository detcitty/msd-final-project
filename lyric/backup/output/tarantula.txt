I don't want to fight every single night
Everything I want is in your eyes
You and me go back to places I don't know to care
The spoils of all I got were left for scraps
Don't let me say this
But you're no worse than me
It's crazy

We are the real
If real ever was
And just because
We are the real
They feel we have enough
We are the real
Cause someone gave us up

I want to be there when you're happy
