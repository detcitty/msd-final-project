Say baby, you know i want you
To let your light come shining through
Aww baby, baby, why don't you just let your light
Come shining through?

Baby, no need to worry
Let your love come shining through
Honey, when in trouble
Let your love come shining through

Ohh baby, you'll be happy
When your light come shining through
Baby, life is a party
Let your love come shining through
