You know what's going on
Over there and over there, okay

(Ordered up a hundred roses
Need a bezel like Blasé, Blasé, Blasé, Blasé
Whiping Maserati, skurr, skurr, skurr
Blasé, Blasé, Blasé, Blasé
Blasé, Blasé, Blasé, Blasé)
Ordered up a hundred bottles in the club like
Blasé, Blasé, Blasé, Blasé
Whiping Maserati, skurr, skurr, skurr

Oh, Blasé, Blasé, Blasé, Blasé

Blasé, Blasé, Blasé, all I drink is Bombay
When I'm with my niggas, I might drink that Henny
Smoking Kush and pull it, motherfuck the police
I ain't scared to die, on them dead homies
Hit them licks, wh-whipping the bricks
Still with the shit
I'm young and I'm rich, young and I'm rich
I got hoes nigga, I got hoes in different area codes, I think I'm Nate Dogg
I started from the ground I'm that nigga now
I stay with the loud, can you hear me now?
