Birds flying high
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel (ooh)
It's a new day
You know how I feel (ooh)

Yeah, I'm a new man, baby
Your other men probably should follow my blueprint, baby
Strap on your seat, and get ready to go
You know I've been filling BeatPort
3 million feed up in the sky full diamonds
I'm only beginning and I get the feeling
I'm behind the beat for the nighters
I got a few Miami Viaces
I don't ever look at the prices
