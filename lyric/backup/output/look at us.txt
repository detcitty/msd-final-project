For all the times that we, we ever were to be
Look at us baby, look at us now
For every day that I should have you by my side
We'll make it baby, look at us now

For every night I pray I know that you will stay
Look at us baby, look at us now
Remembering the time our love was not so fine
We made it baby, look at us now, baby look at us

Everybody believed we would never be
Look at us up above, we are so in love
Everyday in your arms, baby, can't go wrong
We are strong, look at us now

For all the times that we, we ever were to be
Look at us baby, look at us now
For every day that I should have you by my side
