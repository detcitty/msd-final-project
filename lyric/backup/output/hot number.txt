Put your makeup on try to fantasize
It's time to get a little crazy
Sometimes it's good to try it out
Just like the dreams in your head
When the heat is on everybody knows
Theyre in the mood to be a hot number
Some dirty talks and mega shock
To get a zing in your fling


Midnight rides and dances
Everybody wants them
Come and fill my wonders
Oh-whoa-oh hot number


If your hips got rhythm youre beyond control
You've always been a little hot number
Some would be hots afraid to show
Don't you know you like to let it go
