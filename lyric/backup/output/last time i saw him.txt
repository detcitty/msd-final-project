Last time I saw him
He sweetly kissed my lips
Last time I saw him
He said:"I'll be back for more of this"
Last time I saw him
We were crying at the bus
I knew he hated leaving
But he had to set us up

I gave him money
I know I invested well
Mamma doesn't trust him
But he loves me I can tell

Each time the greyhound
Arrives at nine o' clock
But I don't start my crying
'Till that last man's gotten off
