Dig if you will the picture,
Of you and I engaged in a kiss.
The sweat of your body covers me,
Can you, my darling,
Can you picture this?
Dream if you can a courtyard,
An ocean of violets in bloom.
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat,
The heat between me and you.

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold. (So cold).
Maybe I'm just too demanding,
Maybe I'm just like my father - too bold.
Maybe you're just like my mother,
She's never satisfied. (She's never satisfied).
