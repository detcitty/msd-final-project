Chorus: i wanna chill (Chill) on sugar hill (its so lovely, so lovely)
AZ's for real (oh he's for real) he's for real (its so lovely sippin on
bubbly)

At times i wanna watch out the Mariot, zoning on owning co-ops,
foreign drop top coups, and yachts guzzling straight shots a scotch,
formulating up plots ta escape from Salems lock cuz its scorching hot,
making it hard trying ta figure who's out ta trap me, Pataki, got all
kinds of undercovers coming at me, perhaps he, won't be happy, til they
snatch me, and place me where half slacks be, sitting in Catsaki, but
never me, see, my destiny ta be forever free, in ecstacy, on a hill
that awaits for me, so plus, just ta visualize is like a coke rush,
