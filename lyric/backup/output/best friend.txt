Whenever I'm down, I call on you, my friend
A helping hand you lend in my time of need, so I
I'm calling you now, just to make it through
What else can I do, don't you hear my pleas?
Friends may come, and friends may go

But you should know that
I've got your back, it's automatic
So never hesitate to call
Cause I'm your sister and always for ya, and I

I don't know what I'd ever do without you
From the beginning to the end
You've always been here right beside me
So, I'll call you my best friend
Through the good times and the bad ones
Whether I lose or if I win
I know one thing that never changes, and
That's you as my best friend
