USHER LYRICS

"DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love"
(feat. Pitbull)

(yeah man)
So we back in the club
Get that bodies rocking from side to side (side to side)
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone back to life (back to life)
Hands up, and suddenly we all got our hands up
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes

'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
