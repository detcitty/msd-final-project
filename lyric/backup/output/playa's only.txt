I hope y'all got y'all playa's card
'Cause y'all ain't getting in, unless ya do

Bounce, it's the new 12 play
Bounce, though the pussy like L-Way
Bounce, I wanna see your tail shake
Bounce, when you hear R Kelly say

Playa's only where them chicks be checkin' their bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take um from here to the private parties, where there ain't nothing but
Playa's only where the playa's be spinnin' a lot of dough
Honies got ass bouncing on the floor
This is how we behind the playa's door

She on the floor, surrounded by them playa's and thugs
She on the floor, the girls gone wild in the clubs
In V.I.P., got drough with a bottle of bub
She don't care, shakin' ass just throwin' 'em up

I'd really like to get to know her the way she warms her
Bodie up now she got me heated up
I can find I really wanna beat it up
So her how I hit the bottle and spend it up

You don't gotta worry bout being alone
'Cause tonight we'll be together in my home
Exit out the club bouncin' our domes
