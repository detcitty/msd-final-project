Blue jean baby
L.A. lady seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed pirate smile
You'll marry a music man

Ballerina you must have seen her dancing in the sand
Now she's in me always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand
Jesus freaks... out in the street

Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
