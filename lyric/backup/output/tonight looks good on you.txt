You ain't got a dress that I don't like
You ain't got a pair of jeans that don't fit you just right
There's not a minute in the day
That you don't knock me out, you don't blow me away

But girl now that this suns gone down
Woah oh oh
Lookin' at you right here and now
Baby, something 'bout that southern sky
Sittin back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl tonight looks good on you
Something bout the way you're smiling
Making them stars fall right on cue
I just gotta tell ya baby
