Warm days, summer nights
Feeling good, coz the mood is right
Every breath, take a chance
Lovin' the sun, lovin' fun

Sometimes you win
Sometimes you lose
It's all about luck
And the love you choose
So hold on tight
If you think it's right
As long as it keeps you satisfied
And singin' (Na na na nah)

Summer lovin'
Summer fun
Layin' low in
In the summer sun
Summer lovin'
Summer fun
Layin' low in
In the summer sun

Summer days
