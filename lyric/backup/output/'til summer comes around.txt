Another long summer's come and gone
I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight

But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinnin' around and you're holdin' on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly

You had to go I understand
But you promised you'd be back again
