My dope in the bushes
My dope in the bushes
I know how to cook it
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My bitch good looking
My dope in the bushes
I know how to cook it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I did the digital dash
I fuck your bitch in the passenger
I give the junky a blast
I send that dope to your momma tho
Out in the streets like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'mma kid of my word
A hustler the first to the first

These bitches be naggin the kid
They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed her my racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack on muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a 6-trey
