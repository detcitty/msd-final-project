Here's to the good life or so they say
All those parties and games that all those people play
They tell me this is the place to be
All these beautiful people and nothing to see

Sometimes I feel like something is gone here
Something is wrong here, I dont belong here
Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town
And I've lost what I've found, it'll all turn around

(Chorus)
In a little while I'll be thinking about you
