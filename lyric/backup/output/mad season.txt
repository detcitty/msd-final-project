I feel stupid, but I know it won't last for long.
And I've been guessing and I could have been guessing wrong.
You don't know me now, I kinda thought that you should some how.
Does that whole mad season got you down?

I feel stupid, but it's something that comes and goes.
And I've been changing, I think it's funny how no one knows.
We don't talk about the little things that we do without
When that whole mad season comes around.

So, why ya gotta stand there looking like the answer now?
It seems to me you'll come around.
