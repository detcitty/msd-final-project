Hey, man, I don't feel like goin' to school no more
Me neither, they can't make you go, no you daddy, oh yeah

I ain't goin' to school, it starts too early for me
Well, listen man, I ain't goin' to school no more
It starts much, much too early for me
I don't care about readin', writin', 'rithmetic or history

I'm gonna walk to the corner and meet my little Marie
I'm gonna walk to the corner and meet my little Marie
