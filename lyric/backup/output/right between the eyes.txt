Your love for me was nothing but a mystery,
Just something only captured in a dream.
Whoa, then suddenly...
It was hitting me,
Right between the eyes

I wasn't looking for a love explosion,
But I must have been a target my oh my.
Cause when I least expected it,
I took a direct hit,
Right between the eyes
