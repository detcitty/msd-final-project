Common Feat. Mary J Blige - "Come Close"

(verse 1) {Common}
Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know you're sick and tired of arguing,
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we gotta swallow it.
Your heart and mind, Baby, follow it
Smile, happiness, you can model it
and when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'm 'a do the best I can do
'Cuz I'm the best when I'm with you

(Chorus) {Mary J. Blige}
Come close to me, Baby
Let your love hold you
