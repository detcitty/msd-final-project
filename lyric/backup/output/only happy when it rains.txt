I'm only happy when it rains

I'm only happy when it's complicated
And though I know you can't appreciate it
I'm only happy when it rains
You know I love it when the news is bad
Why it feels so good to feel so sad
I'm only happy when it rains
Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me

Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me
I'm only happy when it rains
