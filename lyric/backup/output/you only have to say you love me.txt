i don't know why
don't know why that i torture myself
overact and draw conclusions of truth
sometimes i hate myself for wanting you but then
you only have to say you love me
to make it worth it
you only have to say you love me
and i'm flying flying

so many times i try
to find a way that i
will never be denied
to your world
i put aside my pride
cross the great divide
