Seventeen, the only way I had a car
Is after I dropped my mama off where she needed to go
Four bald tires, with the ceiling famine and the window stuck
But the only thing I cared about was the radio
We'd turn it on, turn it up to ten, and everybody would jump on in

Ridin' down the highway
Who wants to be the DJ
I'll find a spot on the side of the road
You find somethin' on the radio
Like a feel real good song
