I guess it was yourself you were involved with
I would have sworn it was me
I might have found out sooner if
You'd only let me close enough to see

That ain't no way to treat a lady
No way to treat your baby
Your woman, your friend
That ain't no way to treat a lady, no way
But maybe it's a way for us to end

I was only bein' a picture
