I can't waste my time
Trying every line
All the tricks I used before
One, too many times

And I won't buy you things
Or give you diamond rings
I won't call you day and night
Living to just get close to you 'cause

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

I guess in my heart
On a picture card
Pretty roses just won't do
That just ain't my style

I won't run to you
