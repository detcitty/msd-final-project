Ooooooooooh-ooooooooooooh, ooooooooooooooooh, oh whoa

Can you feel me
When I think about me
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do
My world is an empty place
Like I've been wander in the desert for a thousand days, ohh
Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby

I'm miss you so much-can't help it I'm in love
