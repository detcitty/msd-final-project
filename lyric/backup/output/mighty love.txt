Once there was a boy and girl
Boy said "I love you so"
Girl said "I'll never leave you"
They grew older and left each other
`Cause that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes
Then there's a time
Seems like you'll never find
Someone willing to love you
Keep on lookin', you'll soon discover

A mighty love
Will sometimes make you weep and moan
A mighty love
You'll sit all day by the telephone
