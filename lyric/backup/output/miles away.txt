So this is love, or so you tell me
As you're walkin', out the door
Months go by, and I know for certain
It's not the love, I'm lookin' for
Some times, just for a moment
I reach out hope you're still there

Miles away
No you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away

Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were miles away...
