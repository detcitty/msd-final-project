I can't get out of bed today
Or get you off my mind
I just can't seem to find a way
To leave the love behind

I ain't trippin
I'm just missing you
You know what I'm saying
You know what I mean

You kept me hanging on a string
While you made me cry
I try to give you everything
But you just gave me lies

I ain't trippin
I'm just missing you
You know what I'm saying
You know what I mean

Every now and then
When I'm all alone
I'll be wishing you will call me on the telephone
Say you want me back
But you never do
I feel like such a fool
