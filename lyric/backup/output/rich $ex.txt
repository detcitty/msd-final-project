I got my diamonds on
You got your diamonds on
Watches on watches
I looked down and see beauty
Baby let's go have rich sex
Baby let's go have rich sex
Make a little love, have rich sex
Rich sex, bitch
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Make a little love, have rich sex
Baby let's go and have rich sex
Baby girl, let's have some rich sex
I'ma keep my AP on while I do it
We can keep an AP on when we do it
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it
When you look down, see my chains on
When you look down, see my chains on
When you're ridin' on me, see my chains on
When you're ridin' on me, keep my chains on
Baby we can go and have rich sex
Baby girl, go and have rich sex
You ain't ever ever had rich sex
You ain't ever ever had rich sex
Never made love to a misfit
