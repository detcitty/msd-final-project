Since you left me, my life ain't been the same
I'm useless without your love
I'm calling, crying out your name
When I look around
Your love is nowhere to be found
Please come back to me
You know you're my everything
Who will love me?
Who will care?
Who will be there when I need someone for me?
Who will be there to dry my eyes when I go down on my knees?
I need you to say
