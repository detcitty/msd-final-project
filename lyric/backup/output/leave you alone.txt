She said, she said, you ain't no good, no good
but if you feel so good
she said, she said, what if i could?
but I gotta leave you alone, ah
she said I gotta leave you alone
I, she said, I know you bad
but I want you bad
she said, she said, makes me so sad
that I gotta leave you alone
I said, I gotta leave you alone
look, look, look

I got my mind on my money,
all I need is a bad bitch
that I can run through the city spend this cash with
that I can ride through this city spend this cash on
wake up in the morning get my smash on
I want more much baby egg whites
keep your stomach in your thighs and your legs right
while I'm out here focus getting this bread right
but if the head right, Jeezy there e'ry night
wake up in the morning and you're still here
wake up in the morning and i ain't gone
all I ask, let me just do me
and maybe just me and you can get along
had them other bitches mad when they seen us
had to match our Rolexes baby team us
