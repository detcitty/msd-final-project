I can't get it back, but I dont want it back
I realized that, she don't know how to act
Never been a dumb dude
No im not dense
I just had a slight lack of common sense
I was the good guy
She was the bad girl
I'm thinking one girl
She thinking Me, Earl, James and Jimmy
Yep she had plenty, but love for me, she didn't have any
I was inviting, her into my heart, but she was out riding in some other man's car
She was my night time, thought I was her star
Guess I was wrong, but see I'm strong
Won't take long for me to move on

Please don't worry bout me I'm fine
(Please don't worry bout me I'm fine)
Only gonna play the fool one time
(Only gonna play the fool one time)

Trust me when I say

That I'll be ok
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
(Go on girl)
Go on girl
I can't get it back, but I don't want it back.
I realized that, she dont know how to act
