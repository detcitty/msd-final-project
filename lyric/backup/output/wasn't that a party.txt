Coulda been the Whisky
Mighta been the Gin
Coulda have been the 3 or 4 six packs
I don't know but look at the mess I'm in
My heads like a football
I think I'm gunna die!
Tellin me oh me oh my
Wasn't that a party!

Someone took the grapefruit
And wore it like a hat
I saw someone under my kitchen table
Talkin to my old tom cat
They were talkin 'bout hockey
The cat was talkin back!
I longed about the bed
And everything went black
Oh wasn't that a party!

I'm sure it's just my memory
