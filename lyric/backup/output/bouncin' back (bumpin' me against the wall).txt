You keep bumpin' me against the wall
Yeah, I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust
You ain't seen bouncin' back

You keep bumpin' me against the wall
Yeah, I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust
You ain't seen bouncin' back

I really be throwin' my words standin' 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landin' from the tongue
More dramatic than Batman and Robin, ba, na, na, na, na, na

The one that be handlin' they business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be droppin' these albums, showin' 'em how to come back
And you gon' respect me and appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, 'cuz you sorry that you done that

I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much wanna see the rest
Coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet

So if you ain't ready you better get ready
I know I do it better when I'm bein' opposed
Ah, stick ya chest out, keep your chin up
'Cuz sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up

You keep bumpin' me against the wall
Yeah, I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust
You ain't seen bouncin' back
