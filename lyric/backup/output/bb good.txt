I'll pick you up at seven,
We can drive around and see a movie
Every scene will have a meaning
But you'll be the one that moves me
I've been hurt before,
So baby promise that you're gonna be true
I'm gonna BB good,
So tell me that you're gonna be good too
Yeah!

You gotta BB good to me,
I'm gonna BB good to you
We'll be happy as can be,
