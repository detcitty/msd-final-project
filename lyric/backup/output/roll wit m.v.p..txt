[2x]
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

[Chorus]
[3x in the background]
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

We be like
They be like
And everybody's feelin' right singin'
They singin'
We singin'
That's how we do it all night like
Get 'em like
Feelin' like
And ain't a damn thing wrong baby
Stagga Lee and we up in the zone
Got the keys to the crib
And ain't nobody home

[Verse 1]
Well I'm a sixteen spitter (um hum)
Mr. team hitter spleen splitter with a dream
Flip a scene green getter get 'em
Out in the streets with the 19" spinnin' me
Grinning because every single man on my team is winnin'
We sittin' in your trees reachin' up to the sky singin'
(La la la la la la la la la la la)
Yo, hey yo, we rock illa killa
Scratched off the serial
Brothers sayin' Stagga still ain't on that's a miracle
Fuck chicks in the sixes with their name on the leash
Whole reason why I speak on them beats freak on a leash
Ya, Stag cool like cotton clothes when I droppin' flows
