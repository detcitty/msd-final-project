All alone she was living
In a world without an end or beginning
Babygirl was living life for the feeling
But I don't mind, I don't mind
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind

And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone
