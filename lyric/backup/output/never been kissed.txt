If I show up ten minutes early baby
You can bet that you'll be running behind
But it when it comes to loving me now baby
I have to say you're right on time and

I've never been kissed, never been kissed
Never been kissed like this, no, no, no
I've never been touched, never been touched baby
'Til I felt your touch
Oh your love's going to my head so fast
Just like the bubbles in a champagne glass
Now I know what I've been missing
I've never been kissed, like this
