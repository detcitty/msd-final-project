Not so long ago we were so in phase
You and I could never forget the days
But then the fire seemed to flicker
Cold wind came and it carried us away
But we'll get back someday, baby

The dream is still alive
Look here in my eyes
Can you see what I'm feeling?
The dream is still alive
The one of you and I
