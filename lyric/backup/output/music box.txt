Yo
Yeah girl
Can you hear that
It's playing our song
Are you sleepy
Take a nap

You're not afraid, of the dark, are ya

You hear the beat
As it makes ya
Not want to go to sleep

I knock on Dakota's door

It's locked so I go to creep

'Round the back with binoculars

Not 'cause I want to peep
But because I'm hungry
She smells like taco's
I want to eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows
Also sweet
With sugar plums
Oh look, here comes Marshall he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em
He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek

Like a Thanksgiving turkey

A holiday ham
See 'em sprinkled on toast
With strawberry marmalade jam

Flavor my favorite graham crackers

With Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day jack the ripper
Is all that I am
My music box
When the lights are off
