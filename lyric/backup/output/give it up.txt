Your good lovin' is what I need
Good lovin' is what I need
Oh, a little bit of love and some affection
Keep me movin' in the right direction
Good lovin' is what I need

So come on give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it up, give it up
Come on darlin' give it up
Give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it, give it up, give it up
Come on darlin' give it up

A little bit of love and some affection
Keep me movin' in the right direction
