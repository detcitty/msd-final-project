If I could paint a picture
Of the love I have inside
It would paint all of you and all of me
Without no thought of pride

Then maybe you would know
Exactly all the things I feel
Not just a maybe
Baby, I'm for real

'Cause I've been wishin' on the stars and hopin'
Just as it shoots across the sky
Searchin' for the so-called answers
That we're supposed to find in time

Holding you close, not letting go
Baby, I've got to let you know
