Do you want it right now?

Do you know how lucky I feel I am?
To find a man who loves me as I am
You never try to change a single part of me
You're easy to love with those qualities

And every day you teach me more and more
Inside me I'm gonna glow
And every night you think of only me
Ooh, you keep me satisfied you do all the things I like

I want ya, oh I want you so
Do you want it right now?
Oh I can't let go
I want ya so bad give me all you have
I can show you how
Do you want it right now?
Oh yeah, do you want it right now?

You have a rare sensitivity
I really believe you know how to feel
I trust you with all my heart and soul
You care too much to wanna take control

And every day you teach me more and more
