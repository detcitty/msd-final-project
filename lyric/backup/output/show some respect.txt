I made a resolution and I plan to keep my work
But I need you to make it work
You've got to read the message
Understand what's on my mind
'Cause not to see would be a crime
And we could lose it anytime

We've got to show some respect
We've got to learn to protect
Don't take it for granted, I know
That if you want to stay close
We've got to show some respect
