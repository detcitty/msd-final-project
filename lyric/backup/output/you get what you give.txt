Ooh

(cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha)

What, what, what, what
1, 2...

1, 2, 3, OW!
Wake up, kids, we got the dreamers' disease
Age 14, they got you down on your knees

So polite, we're busy still saying please
Frienemies
Who when you're down, ain't your friend

Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz
First we run, and then we laugh till we cry
But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light (Light)

You feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight
You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
