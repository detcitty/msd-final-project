There must be something we can talk about
And maybe there's something here that we can do
No matter what your friends say, don't go too far
Remember there's just one thing
Whenever you come this way
You know I wouldn't get you down
I just like talking to you

It's raining outside
I shake my shoes, downstairs
You never stop dancing
You don't make much sense
No matter what your friends say
Don't go too far
Remember there's just one thing
