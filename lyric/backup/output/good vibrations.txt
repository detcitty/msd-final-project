I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And she's already workin' on my brain
I, I only look in her eyes
But I picked up somethin' I just can't explain
And I'm pickin' it up

I'm pickin' up goodvibrations
She's giving me the excitations
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations

Good good good, good vibrations, ahh
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations)
(She's giving me the excitations)
Good good good, good vibrations, ahh
(I'm pickin' up goodvibrations)
(She's giving me the excitations)
