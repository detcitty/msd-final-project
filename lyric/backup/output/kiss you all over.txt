When I get home, babe
Gonna light your fire
All day I've been thinkin' about you, babe
You're my one desire

Gonna wrap my arms around you
Hold you close to me
Oh, babe I wanna taste your lips
I wanna be your fantasy, yeah

Don't know what I'd do without you, babe
Don't know where I'd be
You're not just another lover
No, you're everything to me

Everytime I'm with you, baby
I can't believe it's true
When you're layin' in my arms
