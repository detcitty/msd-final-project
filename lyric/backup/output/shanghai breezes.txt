It's funny how you sound as though you're right next door
When you're really half a world away
I just can't seem to find the words I'm looking for
To say the things that I want to say
I can't remember when I felt so close to you
It's almost more than I can bear
And though I seem half a million miles from you
You are in my heart and living there
