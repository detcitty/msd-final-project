The doctor said, "Come back again next week
I think that you need me"
All she did was cry, she wanted to die
"Doctor when can you see me here?"
There's a guy out there
Seems like he's everywhere, it just ain't fair

Heartless, heartless,
Never, never out of control
Heartless, heartless
Ya keep on sinnin'
