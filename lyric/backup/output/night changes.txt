Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kinda dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off

Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair

She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that you really want
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about you lately

Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes
