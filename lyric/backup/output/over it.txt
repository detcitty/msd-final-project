I'm over your lies
and I'm over your games
I'm over you asking me
when you know I'm not okay
You call me at night
and I pick up the phone
And though you be tellin' me
I know you're not alone

Oh and that's why your eyes, I'm over it
Your smile, I'm over it
Realized, I'm over it, I'm over it, I'm over

Wanting you to be wanting me
No that ain't no way to be
How I feel, read my lips
Because I'm so over (I'm sorry)
Movin' on and it's my time
