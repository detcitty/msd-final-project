I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love
I'ma put it down down, you gon' fall in love
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love
I'ma put it down down, you gon' fall in love
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love
I'ma put it down down, you gon' fall in love
I'ma put it, I'ma put it, I'ma put it
I'ma put it down

If you put it down right like the way I want it
Play your cards right, maybe we can fall in love
If you put it, put it, if you put it down
If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love, I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love
If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love
I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love, I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love
If you put it, put it, maybe we can fall in love

Ooh your talk game is so tough, damn, I love it all
Even the way you flex, that's what turn me
Ooh you know you make me weak, just 'cause the way you are
'Cause everybody in here know that you're a star
But still I'm letting you know, I got the sweetest heart
