(Michael Peterson/Paula Carpenter)

I was 12 when daddy said to me
Don't take to drinking boy that road don't lead no where
And don't you ever let me hear you swear
Don't you dare
He told me that stealing's a lazy man's way
Something for nothing leaves you hell to pay so don't buy into it
and then you can look the whole world in the eye
Honey I've tried
But Since I met you girl I've been breaking every rule
I must confess I'm just a back sliding fool
