Let 'em know that we're still rock n roll

I don't care about my make-up
I like it better with my jeans all ripped up
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut
You say, "So what (what)?"

I don't care if I'm a misfit
I like it better than the hipster bullshit I am the motherfucking princess
You still love me

Some-somehow
It's a little different when
I'm with you
You know what I really am
All about
You know how it really goes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Some some way
We'll be getting out of this
Town one day
You're the only one that I
Want with me
You know how the story goes
Oh, oh, oh
