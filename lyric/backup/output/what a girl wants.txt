What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Yeah, c'mon!
I wanna thank you for givin' me time to breathe
Like a rock, you waited so patiently
While I got it together
While I figured it out (yeah, yeah)
I only looked, but I never touched

'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holdin' hands, makin' plans
And it's lucky for me, you understand
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy, sets you free
And I'm thankin' you for knowin' exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
