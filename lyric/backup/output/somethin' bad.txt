Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
