I wanna love you girl
Just wanna love you girl
Please let me love you girl
Just wanna love you girl

C'mon, I wanna love you girl
Just wanna love you girl
Let me love you girl
Let me

When we met I was talkin' that game
Parkin' that thang
Since then between us
A lot of things changed

Now it's like the world got a whole different name
I can't stop chics from sayin' my name
Most of it's lies
If not, don't be surprised

You knew I was ballin' when I met you
But really, I started layin' low just to net you
I'm raw as hell, yet can't deny that you special
These girls can't either

Winter, his and her Vivas
Summer, his and her Louie sneakers
You don't think that bother people
Guess again you even need to check your friends

Sayin' that I cheat, right, maybe with my heat
Got a pearl handled chrome thing that I call Sweets
I greet wit' her, creep wit' her, even eat wit' her
Late nights under my sheets, yeah, I sleep with her but thats it

Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it
