Is it fate or random chance
How can I decide
Are we victims of circumstance
When destinies collide

All the odds are against you
But somehow you make it through
You can rationalize it away
But it all comes down to you

Half our lives we spend waiting
For the knock upon the door
When it comes, will it be the one
That I've been waiting for
