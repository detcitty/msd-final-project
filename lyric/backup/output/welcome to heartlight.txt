I like the love
And I like the peaceful
I wish everyone I know could
Stand in the heartlight

I hold the hand
I walk with the teacher
We welcome in the mornin'
Singing together

Can you feel the love that's in my heart
Can you see the flame we got to start
Burnin' like a beacon in the night
O welcome to heartlight

Chorus:
