Yo, yo, yo
They wanna know

Who's that girl?
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Eve's that girl
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Who's that girl?
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Eve's that girl

(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

Yo, yo
Can I turn you on by my word spell
Look into my eyes think I want you, can't tell
Me I keep it sexy, daddy so I can't fail
Keep it gangsta for the cowards so I give 'em hell
Call me misfit, lips spit a gang of trash
Wrist glist now cause I make a gang of cash
Light glance, still street with the doo-rag
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that?
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed game don't run me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty so be it, I'm supposed to change
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't fuckin with my mental
Natural born hustlin' bitch check what I've been through
