I always swore that
Falling in love was not
Something that I would ever
Want to do

Then you came along
And lit a fire in my heart
Now I swear I won't give up
Until I get you

Into my love
It's the only way
'Cause I just can't get you
Out of my mind
Oh, no

Into my love
I need you night and day
I just can't stop this
Feeling for you
Only one thing left to do
I just got to get you
Into my love
