Creep on in (on in)
Woo
See I'm ridin' high...
Whoooo!
Kinda broke
You see me, so all I got is five

I got five!

Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S-t. I-d-e-s
Nevertheless I'm hella fresh, Rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it across the table like ping pong, I'm gone
Beating my chest like King Kong
It's on
Wrap my lips around a 40
And when it comes to gettin' another stogie
Fools all kick in like Shinobi
No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be proper to let my friend hit it
Unless you pull out the fat, crispy
