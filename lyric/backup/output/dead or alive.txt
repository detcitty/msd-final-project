It's all the same
Only the names will change
Everyday
It seems we're wastin' away

Another place
Where the faces are so cold
I drive all night
Just to get back home

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted
Dead or alive
Wanted
Dead or alive

Sometimes I sleep
Sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet
Always go their separate ways
