Let it ride
Shorty, come here 112
Listen listen listen come on, ooo
Luv you, need you
[Incomprehensible]
Let's ride, let's ride

Hey luv, I wanna hold you and talk to you
Put my arm around ya shoulda and walk wit chu
Be that one headed sheriff give me world to you
I kno that nigga doin' what he suppose to do
I've got much more to give than homie do
And you so fine I just wanna roll wit chu
You a queen bitch, need to come close to you
I need a nigga like P to just flow wit chu

And I gotta try 'cuz anything's possible
And you just might see things the way I do
I just wanna get next to you, friends wit you
Burn hunids wake up in the bed wit chu
I luv when you walk how that body move
Pardon my mouth I'm just bein' honest, boo
I would pay for airtime just to vibe wit chu
Kisses and hugs till the next time you swing thru

So many things that I wanna do
Wanna kiss wanna touch, wanna taste, never tease you
