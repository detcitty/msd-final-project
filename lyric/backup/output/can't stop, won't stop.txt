Sick sicker, remix
Okay, Young Gunnaz, okay
Seein' me, check
Big Face, that's right
Big Leo, right
Big bird, yeah holla

Can't stop, won't stop Chingy and the Gunnaz
'Cause we, we get down baby, we get down
The girls, the girls they love us
(Say what)
(Look she right there)
(Her man he right there)

Yup, It's only right that we make it a remix
Young Gunnaz, and Chingy just to give it a lil' twist
Next generation, you better stay focused
Youngaz before they time, man you already know this
Ball 'em, never call 'em, kick 'em out before their moment
It seem like once you done, they start drawlin'
You never have 'em, so you cuff 'em, when you grab him
I treat 'em all the same, even the bad ones

Go Magnum, rose gold chain, for show aim
Four four Magnum, tell C and P when they done better blast 'em
I be laid back, smokin' bags, playin' Madden
You know we tap 'em, middle room, bathroom
Living room, bathroom, sit at home cap 'em
You got it, It's nothin' I had 'em, you can have 'em
Seein' Neef we the streets, Gunnaz we the last one

Can't stop, won't stop Chingy and the Gunnaz
'Cause we, we get down baby, we get down
The girls, the girls they love us
(Say what)
(Look she right there)
(Her man he right there)

Can't stop, won't stop Chingy and the Gunnaz
'Cause we, we get down baby, we get down
The girls, the girls they love us
