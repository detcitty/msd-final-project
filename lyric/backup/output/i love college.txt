I'm nice right now
I, I feel good
If you have a drink

Would you please put it in the air
That party last night was awfully crazy
I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked

Drink my beer and smoke my weed

But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at 3 wake up at 10
Go out to eat than do it again
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club and drink Miller Light
On thirsty thursday and tuesday night ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup
Let's get fucked up
I'm next on the table
Who want what

I am champion at beerpong
Allen Iverson Hakeem Olajuwon

Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it
Otherwise you naked
Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted
