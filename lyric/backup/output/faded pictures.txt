That's right
Life is funny, ain't it?
Sometimes you can end up with

She was more than a women a goddess for all to see
All I ever needed was her right here loving me
For a while we were coolin and groovin and love was on
But I still remember how it felt when are love was gone (Ohhhhh)

Was a photograph she took years ago
Secret memories in her mind, how could love be so unkind
