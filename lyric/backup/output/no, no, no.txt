You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
You'll be sayin'
No, no, no, no, no
When it's really
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

Boy, I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Won't you say what's on your mind

'Cause each and every time you near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you, "What's the deal?"
You hold it all inside

If you wanna be with me
You gotta keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel

'Cause boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come and get my love
It's all here for you

You'll be sayin'
