Uh huh uh, ji ji
Roc-a-Fella y'all
Jigga, Rell, nine-eight edition
This is Roc-a-Fella for life, this is Roc-a-Fella for life
This is Roc-a-Fella for life, this is Roc-a-Fella for life

I play my parts with the honies hard
It's gotten even worse now that the money's washed
Like a letter y'all, the nine-eight find me straight
Good health, can't complain about my financial state
What else? I guess tomorrow knows
I run through chicks like borrowed clothes
I'm the type of nigga your father oppose, never test Jay
