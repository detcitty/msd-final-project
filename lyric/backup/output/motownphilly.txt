Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men

Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

It's long overdue but now
Philly is slammin'
Boyz II Men, A B C, B B D
The east coast family
Never skipped a beat, na
While cooling on South street
Jet black Benz, plenty of friends
And all the Philly steaks you can eat

Back in school we used to dream about this everyday
Could it really happen?
Or do dreams just fade away
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth
So we started a group and here we are
