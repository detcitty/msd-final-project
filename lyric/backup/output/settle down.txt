Get-get-get in line and settle down
Get-get-get in line and settle down
What's your twenty
Where's your brain
Checking in to check you out
Concerned about your whereabouts
Copy that
You're acting strange
So tell me what is going on
So heavy, I bet
I'm fine
I'm hella positive for real
I'm all good, no
I'm fine
It's kind of complicated
That's for sure
But you can see it my eyes
You can read it on my lips
I'm trying to get a hold on this
