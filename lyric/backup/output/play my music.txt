Turn on that radio
As loud as it can go
Wanna dance until my feet can't feel the ground (feel the ground)
Say goodbye to all my fears
One good song, they disappear
And nothing in the world can bring me down (bring me down)

Hand clapping, hip shaking
Heart breaking, there's no faking
What you feel, when you're right at home, yeah (yeah)

Music's in my soul
I can hear it every day and every night
It's the one thing on my mind
