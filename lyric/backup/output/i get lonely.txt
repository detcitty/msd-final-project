I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
Want no one but you

Sittin' here with my tears
All alone with my fears, I'm wondering
If I have to do withoutcha
But there's no reason why

I feel asleep late last night
Cryin' like a newborn child
Holdin' myself close
Pretendin' my arms are yours
I want no one but you
