The clouds are partin', the summer suns startin'
To burn down on that river
My baby's waitin', I got the Chevy shakin'
I'm blazin' a trail to get her, there she is

She's got her shades on and man, she's lookin' strong
Mine all mine for the weekend
The coolers loaded down, we're headed outta town
Jumpin' off the deep end

Goin' barefoot and crazy, me and my baby
Back flip off the flip right bridge
Double dog, dare me and I will
Meet me at the bottom with a cool wet kiss
