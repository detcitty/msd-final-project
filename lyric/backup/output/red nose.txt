H-H-H-Holy shit

All this money on me
Now come take it from the G
All she tryna do is get naked
Naked, naked, naked
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose

Like a, like a, like a red nose

That booty talkin' to me, what that shit say?
Shake it for the dojo I'm the sensei
When she wobble with my song on replay
Almost got her a house up off Kings Way
I told her shake it like a red-nose pitbull
And I'm-a keep throwin money 'til your bank full
Cake-cake-cake-cake, birthday suit
Damn in a little I'm-a forget your age soon
Whoa, OK, now let's do it my way
