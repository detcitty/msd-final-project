Oh I'll never let you under my skin
Baby, I just could not stand, um, hum
To be hurt again

Um, hum, ooh wee, baby, ooh, hoo, listen lady
He'll wine and dine you, take you anywhere you wanna go
Oh, but when the night is over
Hey, you just may not see me no more

All I want is a one night affair that won't hurt nobody
One night affair
Hey, I'll hit 'n' run, you son of a gun
But I'll hit 'n' run, but it could be fun, I said

I don't wanna love nobody
Don't wanna take me a while
Girl, you just may not be ready
To go steady for the rest of your life

So for that reason, a one night affair
