It's not her fault that she's so irresistible
But all the damage she's caused isn't fixable
Every twenty seconds you repeat her name
But when it comes to me, you don't care
If I'm alive or dead

So objection, I don't wanna be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free, and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother

Objection, I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, I've got to get away
