She's been my queen since we were sixteen
We want the same things, we dream the same dreams, alright
I got it all 'cause she is the one
Her mom calls me "love", her dad calls me "son", alright

I know, I know, I know for sure

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl
