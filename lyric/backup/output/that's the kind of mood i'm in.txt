I'll tell you what we're in a rut we're in a deep rut
So habitual, predictable I'll tell you what we ought to do
We ought to drive away, fly away find a way to get away
We need a break from the same old thing of nothin' new

Want to go out on a limb, on a whim, yeah
That's the kind of mood I'm in

Let's go somewhere, nowhere we've heard of
Hang the sign out, do not disturb us
Get a wake-up call about 3 p.m.
That's the kind of mood I'm in
