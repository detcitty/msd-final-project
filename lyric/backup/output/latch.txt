You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down (never)
You, you enchant me even when you're not around (never)
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down (never)
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found (never)

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never)
