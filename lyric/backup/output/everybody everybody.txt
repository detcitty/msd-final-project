Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
You won't belong to me, I let you down
I walk around and see your night skyline
I feel the light but you don't want to stay
So lonely now, just let me off downtown
Sad and free, sad and free
