Gotta hold on to this feelin'
Gotta let you body move
Gotta keep the music jumpin'
Everybody get loose
REPEAT

Face the music, then I'm right behind
With a posse, a mic and a funky rhyme
It doesn't take a lot of time for me to climb
And whem I'm going for mine, I'm like a monkey on a vine
Goin' up the scale and I will prevail
Sharper than the point on the tip of a nail
Movin' with the speed of a thief on the run
My mic is my gun and my posse's the one
Ready for fun, but also for static
Anything breaks and they're ready automatic
I've had it with suckers who try to get paid -
Sayin' they're teaching, but not makin'
The grade - they're played.
I'm the teacher, man, you're the student
Close your ears if you feel you're prudent
And can't deal with the lyrics I'm steppin' with
But they're the lines the people are gettin' with
A lesson well taught, here's some more advice
I don't sweat it on the mic
