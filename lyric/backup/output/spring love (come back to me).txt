I remember when we first started 
You came to me and you were broken hearted 
I took you in and wiped all your tears away 
I gave you loving more than any other gave 
Don't you know I'm the one and I love you girl 
I don't care what they say you know you are my world 
Come back home to the one 
Who loves you more and more 
Soon you'll see that it was me you were searchin' for 

Oh my love searching for 
I really need you 
I really want you baby 
I need you and I want you baby 
Spring love, come back to me 
I gotta have you baby
