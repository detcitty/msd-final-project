(Intro)
Yeah! Get 'em Buck!

(Verse 1)
OK! I'm reloaded my bankroll swole and a nigga can't fold it
I got 'em like HEY! Got 'em rollin
The kush on the way and the champagne frozen
Watch me do my thang, I got these hoes open
I'm ridin presidential like the shit that I'm smokin
Water wih' the work, Petrom on my shirt
And a zip ain't shit I need a quarter P of Purp
'Gon break it down, pass it all around
I can serve Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown
Them dope boys in this bitch like, let me buy that
Broke niggas in this bitch like, let me try that
I need a beat in the bitch, let me call Polow
Mr. Tennakey I still get 'em for the low though
Shawty light up the dro, I ain't ready to go
Can't ban me from the radio or fuck up my show, you know
