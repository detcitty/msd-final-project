I really hate to let this moment go

Touching your skin, and your hair falling slow
When a goodbye kiss, feels like this
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?

Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?

We can make forever feel this way
