Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy!!!
Oh yeah yeah
Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyy!!!
Uh, woo! come on, uh
If I can go, with you
Yo, yo, uh

If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states, where tommorow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2-ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
