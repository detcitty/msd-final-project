Hey, girl, we're gonna take it nice and slow
Hey, girl, we're gonna take it nice and slow
Oh, girl, let it flow
I'm so glad we took the time
To look into each other's mind
We didn't grow too far too fast
And now we know each other well
The things that only time can tell
We've got a love that's gonna last
'Cause we were friends
Before we were lovers
And isn't that the way it should be, uh-huh
Baby, don't change a single thing
Let's take it nice and slow, steady as we go
From now on it's gonna be smooth, smooth sailing
Nice and slow, let it flow
