Rescue me, take me in your arms
Rescue me, I want your tender charm
Cause I'm lonely and I'm blue
I need you and your love too
Come on and rescue me

Come on, baby, and rescue me
Come on, baby, and rescue me
Cause I need you by my side
Can't you see that I'm lonely

Rescue me
Come on and take my heart
