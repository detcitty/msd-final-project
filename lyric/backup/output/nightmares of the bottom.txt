Sleepin' at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly til you swat 'em
But who am I to talk? I ain't shittin' roses
We in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now I'm looking in my rear view, I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear ended
Pause! Like a red light, I'm dead right!
Highway to Heaven, God do you see my headlights?
They say "you don't know what you're doing till you stop doing it"
Well call me clueless cause I do this
Attention all shooters, I'm a shooting star
Life is a course and I'm a shoot for Par
I'm searching for today instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back man I'll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money CMR, blood like a scar
Weezy F baby and the F ain't for "Flaw"

It's like I have it all
