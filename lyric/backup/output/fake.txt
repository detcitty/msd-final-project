Your name was Patty
but now it's Kay

Girl
you seem to change it every day.
Your hair was long
but now it's short

You say: I got it cut
but I don't see no hair upon the floor.
Whenever I go out with you I find out something new.

You're a fake
baby
you can't conceal it

Know how I know
'cause I can feel it.

You're a fake
baby
no rhyme or reason
