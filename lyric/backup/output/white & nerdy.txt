They see me mowin'
My front lawn
I know they're all thinking
I'm so white ‘n' nerdy

Think I'm just too white ‘n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white ‘n' nerdy
Can't you see I'm white ‘n' nerdy?
Look at me I'm white ‘n' nerdy!

I wanna roll with
The gangsters
But so far they all think
I'm too white ‘n' nerdy

Think I'm just too white ‘n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white ‘n' nerdy
I'm just too white ‘n' nerdy
We really white ‘n' nerdy

First in my class here at M.I.T.
Got skills, I'm a champion at DND
MC Escher, that's my favorite MC
Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea

My rims never spin to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library

My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
I got people begging for my top 8 spaces
Yo, I know Pi out to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills but I still wear braces
