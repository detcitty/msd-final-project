I've got a secret in my heart
I've been holdin' for some time
But if I let the fire start
Would it be outta line

I guess there's nothin' left to say
I just wanna make you mine
Don't let a good thing get away
Come on and make up your mind
Ya - give me a sign baby

Can't wait all night
Can't wait all day
When you gonna send a little lovin' my way

Now the feelin's right
