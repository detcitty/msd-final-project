I thought I told ya Imma a star
You see that ice
You see the cars
Flashy lights everywhere we are oh oh
Livin' life, there's no tomorrow
I thought I told you I'm a star
You see the ice?
You see the cars
Flashy lights everywhere we are oh oh
Livin' life, there's no tomorrow

I got money I don't need a range
I'm a pimp I don't need a cane
Big deals charlie you can keep the change
Now that I got the torch Imma gonna keep the flame
Imma keep my aim gotta make the big shots
In my latest suit Louvie V flip flops
Got a bad bitch her hair 'n' nails tip top
Jeremih got the game on the slipknot
Just before the stacks I got rubber bands
Consumers only want you to supply demand
So here I am check my DNA
Gettin money is the only thing on my resume
