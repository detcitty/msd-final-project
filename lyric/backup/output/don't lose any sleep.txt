You tell me to be strong
You tell me to be strong
Goodbye ain't no reason to cry
It ain't no big deal
You say I'll get along
Sure I'll get along
You're so nonchalant
That it's unreal
Well I thought this love would be all I needed
I thought this love was something to believe in
Now you, you say sorry babe
It didn't work out that way
But don't let that ruin your day
Don't lose any sleep now babe
It's just my heart you're breaking
Just my world your taking away
