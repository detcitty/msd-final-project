(Lazy Susan, lazy Susan)
I can't stand to wait
A minute longer
There must be some way
To let you know

Our love is ready
My heart is beating fast
I'm growin' weaker
And I don't know how long
I can last

I've been standing here
Since early morning
(Lazy Susan, lazy Susan)
(Wake up)
Tossin' pebbles at your window pane
(Lazy Susan, lazy Susan)
I'm tryin' to wake ya
'Cause I'm so all alone
