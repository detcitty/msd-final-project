One day I was on the ground
When I needed a hand
And it couldn't be found
I was so far down
That I couldn't get up
You know and me
One day I was one of life's losers
Even my friends my accusers
And in my head
Lost before I begun

I had a dream
But it turned to dust
What I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
