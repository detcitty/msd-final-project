Boy, all I see, is you and me
And all I do, is think of you

Yo, I remember when we met the whole scene was set
Backstage rockin' black shades
Told you not to be afraid
We touched and when your smile turned to a blush
[Incomprehensible]
I had to get to know your name

Then I got your number
17 and under, maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know you, 'cause there's things I wanna show you
Forget them other brothers they know lines that they told you

Now your acting all shy, hmm I wonder why
Everytime I looked at you, you turned and drop your eye
We faced, began to lace you up with lines
Fragrance by Ann Klein had me losing my mind

With your zodiac sign, my perfect match, in fact
I'm compatible with anything from Mio to Ash
Now it's all about us we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Boy all I see, is you and me
And all I do is, think of you
