Freeze, I'm Ma Baker, put your hands in the air
Gimme all your money
This is the story of Ma Baker, the meanest cat
From old Chicago town

She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat
She really moved them down
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all

She was the meanest cat
Oh she was realy tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
'Cause they were mean and strong

Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
She taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
To handle their guns
Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
She never could cry
Ma Ma Ma Ma
Ma Baker
But she knew how to die
