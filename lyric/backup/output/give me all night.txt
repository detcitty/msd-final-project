I have no need of half of anything
No half time, no half a man's attention
Give me all the earth and sky
And at the same time add a new dimension

Half the truth is of no use
Give it all, give it all to me
I can stand it
I am strong that way

Give me all night
Give me the full moon
And if I can't take the whole of you
Give it to me anyway

Give me all night
Till the last star fades
And if you can't take my heart and soul
