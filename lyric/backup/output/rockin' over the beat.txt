Oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah
Oh oh yeah

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
As I'm checkin' up on the rhythm and make
The whole sound sweet
Not like candy you taste that say it can be
YMCO music is good to the truth it's agree

Over and on and on and on and on and on and
Over us all and all to all for all and all to

Each for me and I for y'all,
United we stand, divided we fall
One for all and all for one,
United we stand, we'll get the job done
Each for me and I for y'all,
United we stand, divided we fall
One for all and all for one,
United we stand, we'll get the job done

Oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh yeah

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
