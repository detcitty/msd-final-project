The body's a temple, that's what we're taught
I've treated this one like an old honky-tonk
Greasy cheeseburgers and cheap cigarettes
One day they'll get me if they ain't got me yet

'Cause I'm living, in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living, in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow
