Every night it's the same
I hear you callin' my name
You're lyin' next to me
I give into your charms
You disappear in my arms
I realize it's just a dream, but

Chorus:
Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love

And now I
Shake the sleep from my head
And try to crawl out of bed
Today is just another day
