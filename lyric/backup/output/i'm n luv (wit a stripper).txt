God, lil' mama
U know u thick as hell, know what I'm sayin'?
Matter fact, after the club u know what I'm talkin' bout?
Me and my ****** gon' be together, know what I'm sayin'?

I ain't gon' worry ‘bout them really though
I'm just lookin' at u
U know
U got them big hips, God

Got the body of a goddess
Got eyes butter pecan brown, I see u girl
Droppin' low
She comin' down from the ceiling
To tha flo'

Yea she know what she doin'
Yea yea yea
She doin' that right thang
Yea yea yea
I need to get her over to my crib and do that night thang
'Cause I'm n luv wit a dancer

She poppin' she rollin' she rollin'
She climbin' that pole and
I'm n luv with a dancer

She trippin' she playin' she playin'
I'm not goin' nowhere girl I'm stayin'
‘Cause I'm n luv with a dancer

She poppin' she rollin' she rollin'
She climbin' that pole and
I'm n luv with a dancer

She trippin' she playin' she playin'
I'm not goin' nowhere girl I'm stayin'
‘Cause I'm n luv with a dancer

See I luv all the s*******
Because they show me luv
They know I'd never pay it's free whenever I hit the club
