Really thought that I could live without you
Really thought that I could make it on my own
Sent you away, yeah I said, "I didn't need you"
I let you go, I let you go, I let you go

Now I'm so lost without you, now you're not here and now I know
Lonely is the night when I'm not with you
Lonely is the night ain't no light shining through
Till you're in my arms till you're here by my side
