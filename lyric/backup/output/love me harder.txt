Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain

And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in the moment, you'll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta got to love me harder
Gotta love me harder
(Ho-o-oh, ho-o-oh, ho-o-oh, ho-o-oh)
Love me, love me, love me
(Ho-o-oh, ho-o-oh, ho-o-oh, ho-o-oh)
Harder, harder, harder
