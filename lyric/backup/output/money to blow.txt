I am on a 24 hour champagne diet
Spillin while i'm sippin
Encourage you to try it
I'm probably just saying that cause i dont have to buy it
The club owner supply it
Boy i'm on that fly shit
I am what everybody in my past don't want me to be
Guess what i made it
I'm the muthaf-cking man
I just want you to see come take a look
Get a load of this n-gga
Quit frontin on me
Don't come around and try come gas me up
I like runnin on E
I, I, I
Im on my Disney shit goofy flow
On records i'm captain and my new car is Rufio
Damn
Where my roof just go
Im somebody that you should know
