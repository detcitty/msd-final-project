Honey, I know that you didn't know
That Loving me could be like this
But you're not alone
My mind was blown
I could not resist
And now I find myself
Taken over by the feeling
And I know within my heart
It's too late to say goodbye now
There's a place in me
That belongs to you, baby
So relax and be mine

Now that loves taken over me
What will I do now
Now that loves taken over you
Baby, I'll show you
How it feels to live in ecstasy
Ecstasy, ecstasy
