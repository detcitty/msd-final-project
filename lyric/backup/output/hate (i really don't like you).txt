Love, love, love, love, love, love
Woo!

You were everything I wanted
You were everything a girl could be
Then you left me brokenhearted
Now you don't mean a thing to me
All I wanted was your
Love, love, love, love, love, love

Hate is a strong word
but I really, really, really don't like you
Now that it's over
I don't even know what I liked about you
Brought you around
And you just brought me down
