Oooh,
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you,
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh

I found my happiest days,
When you came to see your grandma in may
I bumped into you by the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now

Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
(Bye, bye)

Don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
