Well I've never been much for admitting things
That's why it's all so hard to say
That I'm head over heels
In love with your kind of insanity

And if it please your highness
On a sunny day sometime
Can I take your picture in the park
With silk and satin on?

Star baby, flashy little shiny little two-timin' mama
Singin' star baby, shiny little flashy little lovin' machine
