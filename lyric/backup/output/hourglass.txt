I feel like I'm pounding on a big door
No one can hear me knocking
I feel like I'm falling flat to the floor
No one can catch me from falling

The hourglass has no more grains of sand
My watch has stopped, no more turning hands
The crew have abandoned the ship
The lights are on but no one is in

Take it to the bridge, throw it overboard
See if it can swim, back up to the shore
No one's in the house, everyone is out
All the lights are on and the blinds are down

Take it to the bridge, throw it overboard
See if it can swim, back up to the shore
No one's in the house, everyone is out
