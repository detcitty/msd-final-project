Well I don't know why I came here tonight.
I've got the feeling that something ain't right.
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs.

Clowns to the left of me!
Jokers to the right!
Here I am stuck in the middle with you.

'Cause I'm stuck in the middle with you
And I'm wondering what it is I should do.
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face.
Losing control and running all over the place.
