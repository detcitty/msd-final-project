O'day Alan
Miscellaneous
Undercover Angel
Crying on my pillow, lonely in my bed,
Then I heard a voice beside me and she softly said,
"Thunder is your night light, magic is your dream."
And then as I held her, she said, "See what I mean?"

I said, "What?" She said, "Ooh-ooh-ooh, whee."
I said, "All right!" She said, "Love me, love me, love me!"
