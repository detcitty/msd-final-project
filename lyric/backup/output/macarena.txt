I'm not trying to seduce you
When I dance they call me Macarena
and the boys they say que soy buena
they all want me
they can't have me
so they all come and dance beside me
Move with me
Chant with me
and if your good I'll take you home with me
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegria cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena
Hey Macarena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegria cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena
Hey Macarena
Now don't you worry about my boyfriend
The boy who's name is Vitorino
