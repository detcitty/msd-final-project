I'm over here lookin' at you
You're over there watchin' me too
Both paintin' pictures of
Of how we'll kiss and hug

So, what we gonna do
So, what ya gonna do? What ya gonna do?
Tell me why we're standing here?
The moment's fresh and so sincere
You've gotta my mind blown
And baby, I'm ready to go

But if it's worth your while
Say something, say something
If it's worth your while
Say something good to me

Hey hey hey, hey hey
If it's worth your while
Do somethin' good to me

Let's make it hot as you can stand it
Something like volcanic
You know it seems organic
Just like the stars and planets, yeah, we are
