You say that I'm messing with your head
All 'cause I was making out with your friend
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong
I can't stop 'cause I'm having too much fun

You're on your knees
Begging please,
Stay with me
But honestly
I just need to be a little crazy

All my life I've been good, but now
Ah, I'm thinking "what the hell"
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good, but now
