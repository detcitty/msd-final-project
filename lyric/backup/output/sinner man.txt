Don't be touching me
Don't be holding me
Don't you understand

You're too much for me
There's a fire in me
You're a sinner man

With your devil lies
And your evil eyes
Oh, you know you can

Take the best of me
And the rest of me
Damn you, sinner man

You get this started and
There's never any way to stop
I don't know how to cool it down
Yes, you make it hot

I said no, I said no
I said no, no, no
But it never does me any good

When you look at me
You start a fire
Touch me and my flames
Get higher

Don't be touching me
Don't be holding me
Don't you understand
