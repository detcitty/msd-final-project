Hi, I'm Tune, the man on the moon
I live on the beach, get the sand out ya shoes
And all of that change since I met you
So we can leave that old shit in the restroom
ok now I'm into you like it never know

I fall for you baby
I need a parachute
so wet I need a wer suit
you way to fly

I can be a jet fuel
Now tell me what you like
I like what you tell me
and if u understand me

you can overwhelm me
it's too late, it's too late
every finish line is the beginning of a new race
Young Money!

You got me and I could not defend it
I tried but I had to surrender
