Standing on the chair like I don't really care
Got bitches by the pair, I'm baller of the year
And haters everywhere but I don't really care
No I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't really care
No I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't really care
Got bitches by the pair, I'm baller of the year
And haters everywhere but I don't really care

Waka flockaaa!
I keep them bad bitches yelling it
Thugged out rich as hell plus I'm throwing dick
Drunk as shit, everywhere I go I'm yellin bricksquad monopoly loud as shit
Throwing money in the air fuck it I don't care
50 for the ear rings that's 100 for a pair
Versace on my ass 2 bands for my underwear
Foreign cars foreign broads baller of the year
Sparkles on my champagne independence day
I ain't really want yo number yo friend look better anyway
