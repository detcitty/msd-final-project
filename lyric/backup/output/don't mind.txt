Hola, Hola Ma

You said once you take me with you, I'll never go back
Now I got a lesson that I want to teach
Ima show you that where you from don't matter to me
She said "Hola, Cómo estás?"
She said "Konnichiwa"
She said "Pardon my French"
I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase"
And I said "N'ap boule"
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all
She said "Hola, ¿Como estás"
She said "Konnichiwa"
She said "Pardon my French"
I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase"

And I said "N'ap boule"

No matter where I go you know I love'em all
