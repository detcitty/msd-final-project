Tell me
If you still care
Tell me
If you still care

Let me know
Have you started to lose
Your love for me
And if so
Will you still continue
To be on my side

Tell me
If you still care about me (Tell me, girl)
Tell me
If you still care about me

I was so
Insecure with you
Did you still want me
So I let go
Of the feeling that you
Were still all mine
