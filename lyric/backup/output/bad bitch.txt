Got a good thing goin' with a bad bitch
You know who to call when you need it
Wish I had another you, I'm greedy
Sometimes like that nigga get greedy
Got damn I fell in love with a bad bitch
You know that every time you leave me
Even though I know how men be talkin'
I just know that nigga wanna be me
Came in here and fell in love with a bad bitch
Back then she ain't have shit
Now she grown up, she got ass, tits
Wanna know where she got that ass at
She hit my heart, a toot, toot on it
She got a dump truck, I put a boot on it
Don't mind spendin' this loot on it
Treat her like my whip, I put some shoes
on her
Got a dump truck, put a boot on her
I don't mind trickin', spendin' loot on her
Walk up in the club, and toot, toot on her
She's a bad bitch, put shoes on her
God damn, fell in love with a bad bitch
Said, "French, take me to Paris"
Dominican mami from Cali
I said, "Gon' bend it over, let me grab it"
I said, "Gon' bend it over, make it nasty"
Walked up in the club, rollin', Stevie
Wonder glasses
