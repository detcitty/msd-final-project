Phillip, I know you said you're leaving
But can't we discuss this at all
Look, baby, there ain't nothing to dicuss
I mean, you know, we been
Through this a thousand times
Everything's been said

You be leaving because
Of your son, right (that's right)
And because of your son
That's the reason you had your wife
Laying up here in my bed last week, right
The neighbors told me when I
Went to Philadelphia, she was
Here the whole weekend

Just tell me something
You been married to her
Been shacking with me
Who you feel you're cheating on

Well, I don't feel like
I'm cheating on nobody
You know, I'm just
Going on home, that's all

Wait a minute, the doorbell's ringing
Lemme get the bell

Well, do say, right on time
Mrs. Jody again, what do you want
(My husband) well
You're not getting him
(Oh, I'll take him with me)
I know what you're gonna take
You're gonna take a good A-kicking
