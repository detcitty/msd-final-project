Open the door, baby turn on the light
We're gonna have a party tonight
For a rocker
For a rocker

I know it's late and you're already down
You ain't ready for people around
I'm gonna tell you something I found out
Whatever you think your life is about
Whatever life may hold in store
Things will happen that you won't be ready for

I've got a shirt so unbelievably bright
I'm gonna dig it out and wear it tonight
