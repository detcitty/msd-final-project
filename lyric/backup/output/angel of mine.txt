When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of mine

I look at you looking at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
Gonna love you boy you are so fine
Angel of mine

How you changed my world you'll never know
I'm different now, you helped me grow

You came into my life
Sent from above
When I lost all hope
You showed me love
