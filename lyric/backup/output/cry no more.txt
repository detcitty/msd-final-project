Cry no more, no more, no more
Shoo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Hmm, you fell so deep in love
'Twas like the fairy tale that somehow came true
But then it fell apart
Became a nightmare, what happened to the love

Now that it's over
You've been crying all night long, yeah
Oh, yeah, baby
Thinkin' of your sweet memory
Wondering what you done wrong, ey... baby

(Heartaches you) Heartaches you've had
You gave your very best
You don't have to cry no more (No more)
I'm what you're looking for (Mmm, hmm)
