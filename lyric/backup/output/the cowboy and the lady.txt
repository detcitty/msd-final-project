This song was first released on the some days are diamonds album. it is the only album it has been released on.

in the airport lounge she sat in a marlena dietrich hat
the grandest lady i had ever seen
outside the heavy rains had grounded all the planes
so i asked her if she'd like some company

in my rhinestone studded suit, my cowboy hat and boots
i must have been a sight for her to see
