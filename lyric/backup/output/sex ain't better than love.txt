I been out chea in these streets and I done learned
Every girl I gave my lovin to
Was only a substitute
I been out chea in these streets and I done learned
Even though she's in my arms
This ain't where my heart belongs

Sex in the air, no lovin here
Soon as I get through, I'm outta there
And it feels so bad, but it felt so good
Wishin I could care, girl I never could
But then I fell into good love
Didn't let me touch the ground
Now I see it clear that your heart is there
And all these other women they just can't compare
Girl I know
