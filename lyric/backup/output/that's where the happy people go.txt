I used to spend most of my time
Just being alone, yes, I did
Nothing to do, no place to go
Just stayed at home

So I put my blues upon the shelf
And I made up my mind
To live a little myself
So I went on down to a disco

Disco, that's where
The happy people go
(Happy people go)
And they're just dancing along
To a perfect song at the disco
