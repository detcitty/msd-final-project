Breathe

You get me so
Get me so excited

I'm hot, come on, so get it, get it
And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
So you can

Act bad
Don't hurt me
Look sexy
Talk dirty

And I'll open my spot for you
Anytime you want me to
Get me so excited

For some girls it might be the money that really turns you on
But for me it's an attitude that keeps me dialin' your phone
And no words are suitable to describe your swagger babe
And my body is in overdrive dying to have you inside of me

Do you like it when I do it
I go head to toe
And whenever you pursue it
You'll never hear the word no
So forget about them other girls baby
Cause now you're rolling with a woman baby
