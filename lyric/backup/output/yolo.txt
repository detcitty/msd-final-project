YOLO
YOLO, you only live once.
The battle cry of a generation.
This life is a precious gift.
So don't get too crazy,
It's not worth the risk.
You know that we are still young.
So don't be dumb.
Don't trust anyone,
'Cause you only live once.
Ugh, you only live once,
That's the motto.
So take a chill pill,
Ease off the throttle.
Never go to loud clubs
'Cause it's bad for your ears.
Your friends will all be sorry
When they can't hear.
And stay the hell away from drugs
'Cause they're not legal.
Then bury all your money in the backyard
Like a beagle.
'Cause you should never trust a bank
They've been known to fail.
And never travel by car, a bus,
Boat or by rail.
And don't travel by plane.
And don't travel at all.
