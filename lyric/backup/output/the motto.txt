I'm the f***in' man, you don't get it do ya?
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
Go uptown, New York City b****
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, f***in' women ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't s*** changed
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel?
Twenty five sittin' on twenty-five mil uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay, okay
Getting paid well holla wen ever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune "light one, pa** it like a relay"
YMCMB you n****s more YMCA
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo
