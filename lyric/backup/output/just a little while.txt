Baby, I like it when it feels this good
You always seem to make me smile
And can't nobody do what you do
When you love me just a little while

I, I know you got somewhere to go
And I got somewhere to be right now
I'll make them wait all day long
If you wanna get a little wild

I don't want to be a distraction to you, no no no
So maybe I'll just lay around
Play by myself
While touching on my favorite fruit

Can't stop thinking 'bout the things we do
And how it feels makin' love to you
I'm ready to get it baby if you got it to dish out
Just love me for a little while

I wanna make it like a dream for you
