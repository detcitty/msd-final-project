Well, I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way
She felt it every day
And I couldn't help her

I just watched her make
The same mistakes again
What's wrong, what's wrong now?
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs
She wants to go home

But nobody's home
That's where she lies
Broken inside
With no place to go
