I do what I do, I do what I do
To have you (have you)
I do it all to have you
I do what I do to have you (have you)
I do it all to have you (I do I do I do)
I do what I do to have you (have you)
I do it all to have you (I do I do I do)

Did you look the way you wanted to look?
Did you feel the way you wanted to feel?
Are you happy now, that we fantasized?

I do what I do
I do what I do to have you (have you)
