I'm that flight that you get on, international
First class seat on my lap, girl, riding comfortable
Cause I know what the girl them need, New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport, you make it hard to leave

Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me

You know the words to my songs
