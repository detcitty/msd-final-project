When I met you woman
I couldn't help but notice a face so beautiful
Now imagine, the faces you'd make if we ever made love

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Pulled up in the drop top Benz
Hit the horn two times and you walked outside (mmmhmm)
Dress keep hugging them thighs
And the only thing inside my mind is (mmmhmmm)
I want you
Yes I do, and if there's anything you suggest I do
Then tell me

Now we all in the crib on my sofa
Girl I'm so glad you came over
I wanna tell you 'come closer'
But I don't know if you feel, like I feel
Tell me girl
