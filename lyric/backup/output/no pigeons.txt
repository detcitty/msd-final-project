Her feet hurt so you know she want a ride

(Uh oh) Game is somethin' we got alot a

2 - (Uh oh) Cause I don't want no Pigeons
Them be them girls who gets no dubs from me
Playin' the bar dumb broke wit her best friend's coat
Tryin' to holler at me

I don't want no Pigeons
Them be them girls who gets no dubs from me
Playin' the bar dumb broke wit her best friend's coat
