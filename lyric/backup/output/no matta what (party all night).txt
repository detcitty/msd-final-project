Tonight we're gonna hang out
Me and my girls gonna hit a party
Gonna wile out
Manicure, pedicure, so we look tight
And there's just enough money for the night out
So now it's time we go hop up in the 6-4
Drop top down headed for the disco
Maybe we might catch some guys eyes
If we don't, we don't care, cuz we still
Gonna have a good time

It's friday night, got visions in my head
But Nothin' on mind, so let the music play
So let me hear you say

Aaa Ohh Aaa Ohh
We gonna have some fun
Aaa Ohh Aaa Ohh
Party all night
Aaa Ohh Aaa Ohh
That's all we think about
Aaa Ohh Aaa Ohh
No matta what's going down
AO AO
