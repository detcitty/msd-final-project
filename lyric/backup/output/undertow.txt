I don, t wanna talk now
I don, t wanna hear you scream no more
Want somebody to save me
Everything I do feels like its wrong
All we do is fall down
even though we try to stay afloat
I swear its gonna kill me
even though you think it wont
So why rock a boat and make waves
And everything, s coming okay
So why am I confused if you love me
Thought this would be smooth sailing

Cause I don, t wanna let you go
and we, re caught in the undertow
Cause I ain, t losing my control
And we, re caught in the undertow
