Ow, hey

Tell me what you're
Gonna do about that
Tell me what you're gonna do
I got to know about that

Is your love for real
Do you know how I feel
Tell me what you're
Gonna do about that

I got ants in my pants
And I need to dance
Come on

I got ants in my pants
And I need to dance
Some big fine mama
Come and give me a chance

Hey, hey, hey
I got ants in my pants
And I need to dance
Some big fine looker
Gonna make me prance
