Usher baby, yeah
Did it again
And this time I'mma make you scream
(Usher) yeah man

I see you over there so hypnotic
Thinkin' 'bout what I'd do to that body
I'd get you like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Got no drink in my hand, but I'm wasted
Getting drunk on the thought of you naked
I get you like ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby
And I tried to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back
