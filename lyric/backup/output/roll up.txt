I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Shawty, I roll up
I roll up, I roll up

It's your anniversary isn't it?
And your man ain't acting right
So you packing your Damier luggage up
Calling my cell phone, trying to catch a flight

You know one thing straight
I'll be there girl whenever you call me
When you at home, that's your man
Soon as you land you say it's all me

'Cause shit ain't all G with him, no more
You ain't entertained
Since I meet you a couple months ago
You ain't been the same

Not saying I'm the richest man alive
But I'm in the game
As long as you keep it 100
I'ma spend this change

Whenever you need me, whenever want me
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
