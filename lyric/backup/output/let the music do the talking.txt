ba ba ba ba ba ba yeah

Want to take a chance and dance before
I got to leave alone.
One short song, and she'll be gone
I wish her off was on.
Gotta try another way to get her
to come aroung to me.
Wanna take a chance and dance before
I gotta leave alone.

Let the music do the talking
(I can't wait)
Let the music do the talking
(save the day)
Let the music do the talking
(let you know)
Let the music do the talking
(sell my soul)
Let the music, honey, do the talking.
. . .
One more thing I've gotta say
but I'll explain it a different way.
