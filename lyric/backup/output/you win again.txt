I couldn't figure why
You couldn't give me what everybody needs
I shouldn't let you kick me when I'm down
My baby

I find out everybody knows that
You've been using me
I'm surprised you
Let me stay around you

One day I'm gonna lift the cover
And look inside your heart
We gotta level before we go
And tear this love apart
