Baby you don't pay me no mind
You act like you don't love me no more
Maybe you need space or some time
Your attitude is uppredictable and I don't want to make you unhappy
If your not happy then your free to go on cuz I don't want you stayin around if I make you so
Miserable

If you don't want me then don't talk to me (if you don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself (go ahead and free yourself)
If you don't want me then don't talk to me (if you don't want me then don't talk to me)
Go ahead to someone else (go ahead to someone else)
If you don't want me then don't talk to me (if you don't want me then don't talk to me)
