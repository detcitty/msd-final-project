Through the night while I was fast asleep
I could feel you tuggin' me 

Then I slowly opened my eyes
You were layin' by my side
Oh what a night

Could I be dreamin'?
Are you really with me
Are you right here by my side?
Could I be dreamin'?

I've waited for this moment for so long
And now you're mine
No, it's not a dream
