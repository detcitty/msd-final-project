You can buy you a brand new truck
Chrome it all out, jack it way up
You can build you a house up high on a hill
With a pool and a pond and a view to kill
You can make all the money in sight
But you ain't livin? a good life

? Til you put a girl in it, you ain't got nothin?
What's it all worth without a little lovin?
Put a girl in it, some huggin? and some kissin?
