Going up, she said, uh, huh
Just as we had started
To climb together, hoo, hoo

Looking up, I said
Hey, look, umm
Maybe I could see you tonight
And she said, never

Thought I was out of luck
But ten seconds later
Somehow we got stuck
In that elevator, woo

Heaven on the 7th floor
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Heaven on the 7th floor
(I wanna tell you)
