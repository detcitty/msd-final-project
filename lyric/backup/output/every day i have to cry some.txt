There was a little girl
I had planned to marry
This was my love
I didn`t want to share it

I thought that love would
Make my life bright and sunny
She said she couldn`t love me
Cause I didn`t have no money

So, every day, I have to cry some
Every day, I have to cry some
Drive the water from my eyes some
Every day, I have to cry
