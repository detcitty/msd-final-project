Life is a paradise

Woah, whoa yeah

Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight
Lucky love belongs in teenage heaven
I know, I know
'Cause I've been there with you tonight

I believe life could be paradise once again (again)
And the love we thought we lost is sleeping within
