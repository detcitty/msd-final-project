Here we are folks, the dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Tell me, have u got the look?

U walked in, I woke up
I've never seen a pretty girl look so tough
Baby, u got that look

Color u peach and black
Color me taken aback
Crucial, I think I want ya

U've got the look, u've got the hook
Sho'nuff do be cookin', in my book
Ur face is jammin', ur body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get 2 rammin'
