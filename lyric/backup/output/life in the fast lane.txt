He was a hard-headed man he was brutally handsome
and she was terminally pretty
she held him up and he held for ransom
in the heart of the cold, cold city

they said he was ruthless said he was crude
they had one thing in common: they were good in bed
she'd say, "faster, faster. "the lights are turning red."
