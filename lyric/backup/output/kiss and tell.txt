Everytime somebody says to me,
it's a secret, well i have to laugh
'cause that is something i just can't keep
it's a secret,

oh i've tried it once or twice
but it didn't work too well
so you'd better think it over
'cause i'm gonna tell

la-la-la-la-la-la-oh-oh
i'll kiss and tell
and everybodys' gonna know
la-la-la-la-la-la-oh-oh
i'll kiss and tell
gotta let my feelings show

'cause they tell me it's gotta be a secret thing
