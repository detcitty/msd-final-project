Bad Boys 2, the soundtrack
Let's go

Hey girl, what your name is? Where you from?
Turn around who you came with?
Is that your ass or your momma have reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here

I'm still a sucker for corn rolls, you know I never changed that
(Nah uh)
Your body is banging mamma but where your brains at?
(Come on)
I'm still the same cat when I was young, I was running with bad boys
But now I'm older, hope they saw I'm running with bad boys
(That's right)

Here come another man
Unlike no other man
Candy coated whoa
Switching in every lane

Ya'll help me
Why don't cha?
Please help me
A thug is we then it's only two G

I like the cocky bow legged ones
Like white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians
Shake it for Nelly son

Manolos, Ma-no-no's
I can't tell
Everybody and their hootchies
When you do it do it well
