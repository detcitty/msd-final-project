You can break away or you can stay
You choose your life, you're free to fly
Go on and fly
Go on and fly

She had it in her own time
To get away and try to find
Somewhere to go, to run
She saw the world through open eyes
And never let a soul inside
Don't come too close, so close
Baby thinks she's smart, but what about her heart?
