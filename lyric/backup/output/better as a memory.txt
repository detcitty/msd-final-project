I move on like a sinner's prayer
Lettin' go like a levee brakes
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
Get reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleed

My only friends are pirates
It's just who I am
Well, I'm better as a memory
