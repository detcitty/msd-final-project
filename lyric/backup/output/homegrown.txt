I got a piece of land out in the country side,
lay back and smell the sun warm up the Georgia pine.
Been so good to me, takin' it easy.
Why would I ever leave? Cause I know,
I got some good friends that live down the street,
Got a good lookin' woman with her arms â€˜round me,
live in a small town where it feels like home,
I've got everything I need, and nothin' that I don't.
