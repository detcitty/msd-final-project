(feat. Michael Jackson)

Centipede
Centipede

Your love
Is like a ragin' fire, oh
You're a snake that's on the loose
The strike is your desire

But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire, huh
And when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire

I feel, oh, yeah
A longin' for your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To give him all your love, ho
