What are we suppose to do
After all that we've been through
Where everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone
There is nothing else to proof

Now you still deny the simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love is gone
There is nothing else to proof

Now you still deny the simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love is gone
Love is gone...
Now that the love is gone
