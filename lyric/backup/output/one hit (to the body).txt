You fell out of the clear blue sky
To the darkness below
The smell of your flesh excites me
My blood starts to flow
So help me God

You burst in in a blaze of light
You unzippered the dark
One kiss took my breath away
One look lights up the stars
And it's it's one hit to the body
It comes straight from the heart
One hit to the body
Sure went straight to the mark
So help me God

It's one shot when you love me
