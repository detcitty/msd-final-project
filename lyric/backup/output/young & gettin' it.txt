Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
And shawty wanna roll, I’m like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I’m just living my life
I’m just young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

Yeah, young nigga I get money and fuck hoes on my spare time
