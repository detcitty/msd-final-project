Enrique, Usher
This is for the dirty girls
All around the world
Dirty dirty dancer
Woo!

Another day
Another night
And she’s acting like she don’t sleep
She’s a five when she drinks
But she’s a ten when she’s on top of me

Listen!

She don’t want love
She just wanna touch
She’s a greedy girl to never get enough
She don’t want love
She just wanna touch
She’s got all the moves
To make you give it up

She’s a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer never ever lonely
She’s a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer you’ll never be her only
She’s a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer never ever lonely
She’s a dirty dirty dancer
Dirty dirty dancer you’ll never be her only

Yeah yeah yeah
