You know you fooled me
Put good things on my mind
Got me feeling free

Fooled me
You put good things on my mind
Gave your love to me

I figured it was like the other
Didnâ€™t expect to go any further
Just knew it wouldnâ€™t last
I guess I was living in my past

Then you fooled me
Put good things on my mind
Got me feeling free

Fooled me
You put good things on my mind
Gave your love to me

At first you seemed out of reach
I was getting nowhere fast
And it occurred to me
Hye lady, you might be out of my class
