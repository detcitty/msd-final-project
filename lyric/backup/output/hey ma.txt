Yeah, come on

Hey Ma, what's up, let's slide, alright, alright
And we gon' get it on tonight
You smoke, I smoke, I drink, me too, well good
'Cuz we gon' get high tonight

Got drops, got coupes, got trucks, got jeeps, alright
'Cuz we gon' take a ride tonight
So Ma, what's up, let's slide, alright, alright
And we gon' get it on tonight

Yo, now I was downtown clubbin', ladies night
Seen shorty, she was crazy right and I approached baby like
Ma what's your age and type?
She looked at me and said you's a baby right

I told her, I'm 18 and live a crazy life plus I'll tell you what the 80's like And I know what the ladies like need a man
That's polite, listens and takes advice, I could be all three
Plus I can lay the pipe come wit me, come stay the night
