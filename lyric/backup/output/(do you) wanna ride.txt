Do you wanna ride

[Intro]
Whassup baby?
You wanna get freaky?
Oh, wanna get freaky
That's right

I'll pick you up at about 5: 30
Take you to my house, we can get dirty
See I ain't got no shame in my game
Get you on the bed, make you scream my name

Girl don't you hold back
Cuz my lovin' is all there
See baby, I can do it like this
Side to side, up and down
Round and round, pound for pound
