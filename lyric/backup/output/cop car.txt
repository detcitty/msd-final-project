We drove right past
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off

We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
That's when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought

Man, ain't this some shhhh

Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing

Baby, yeah
I know it sounds crazy

But there was somethin bout the way
The blue lights were shinin
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you
Going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that
Running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so
