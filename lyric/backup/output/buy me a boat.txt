I ain't rich, but I damn sure wanna be
workin' like a dog all day ain't workin for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that'd kick the bucket

an' I was sittin' on a pile like Warren Buffet
I know everybody says money can't buy happiness
but it can buy me a boat
and it can buy me a truck to pull it
It can buy me a yeti 110

iced down with some silver bullets

Yeah I know what they say
money can't buy everything
