It's like this:
I'm that guy, you're so fly,
Gotta get a piece of that sweet potato pie
I'm that guy, you're so fly,
Gotta get a piece of that sweet potato pie

First Verse:

Now the way of today with the homies is straight,
Gettin' fucked up off the dank, CHRONIC,
Bud, What, ever you wanna call it,
It's peace to you fuckin' alcoholics, for,
Makin' the proper remedy,
Cuz when I hit it, bitches envy me,
You say you want wine? Yeah I guess that's fine,
But thai is the sky when you talkin' about mass,
Now my thai got a friend named Gin,
Got me all straight now my dick won't bend,
