a winter palace
from the arabian nights
white waves on an ocean
gems from a golden age

life in your new world
turning round and round
making some sense
where there's no sense at all

no promises
but if you should fall

stars die in the silence
of arabian nights
wind washes the seasons
in these days of a golden age
