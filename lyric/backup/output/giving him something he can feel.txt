Many say that I'm too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from
But you will see, it's just a matter of time
My love will surely make you mine

Well, I'm livin' in a world of ghetto life
Everyone seem so uptight
But nothin's wrong, it's alright, my man
I like the way we carry on
His love will send me on and on with my man
