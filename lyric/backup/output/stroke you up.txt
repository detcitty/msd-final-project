Relax baby, I'm gonna make you feel real good
Tonight is your night, come here
Let's get this shirt off
Now tell me what you like
'Cause I make it everything you want
Now come closer, uh uh closer
Don't be scared, touch me, right there
Oh yeah, uhh, you go boy

You asked for me
So whatcha wanna see me for
I wanna show you something
Oh yeah and what's that
Turn the lights down half way
Huh, hey yo that's cool

Do you mind if I stroke you up
(I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down
(I don't mind)
All through the night
(I don't mind)
Until your body's tired
(I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you up
(I don't mind)
Do you mind if I stroke you down
(I don't mind)
All through the night
(I don't mind)
Makin' you feel so right
(I don't mind)

C'mon in and close the door
I've got what you're looking for
Dim the lights, unplug the phone
And turn the radio on
I've got what you need
Just put your trust in me
And I won't let you down
So give me your love right now

Give it up
