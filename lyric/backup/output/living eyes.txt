Would you believe me if I told you your tomorrow is my yesterday
But be alive
I know that we will
The world keeps on moving but I'm holdin' still
In the beginning I was far away and praying for my destiny
That would arrive
The moment you're born
For we will be here when the miracle comes

Living eyes, when under the sun don't cry
