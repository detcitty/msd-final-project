You-you got me... 
You-you got me... 
You-you got me... 
You-you got me... 

You-you got me... 
You-you got me... 
On my knees.

One sunday morning, 
I was all alone, 
When he called me up and said, 
Meet me in the park tomorrow.

I didn't know what to say, 
Never happened to me before.
And I don't even
Know his name, 
But one thing is for sure, 

Now listen, 
I started singin' somethin'
I never sung before.
La la la, la la la
Na na na, na na.
I started singin' somethin'
I never sung before.
La la la, la la la
Na na na, na na.

My body says yes, 
But my mind says no.
You got me... 

My body says yes, 
But my mind says no.
You got me, 
On my knees.

One monday morning, 
I was lyin' in my bed.
Time was runnin' out and I wondered, 
What am I supposed to do now?
