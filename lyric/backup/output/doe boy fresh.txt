Yeah, Hypnotize Minds, Three 6 Mafia
Academy Award winners, what?
Chamillionaire, we stronger then ever, for real
The last 2 off, goin', it's goin' down

I stay doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?
Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?

Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?
Doe boy, doe, doe, doe boy fresh
Yeah, now what it is, boy?

Another day, another dollar, another night to make a hoe holler
I pop her cherry, then I pop my collar
Pop brand new tags off a brand new clothes
Brush my hair back and kick the hoe out the door

Flip a quarter, see which ride I'm pullin' out the garage
While it's transmitters in the bump of my barge
Pull a pack out as if my body ever sinned
10 o'clock at night but my day just begin

07 Murcielago with the wings out
I usually never drive it but I heard the hoes out
Fresher than a mint leaf, smellin' like a coca leaf
Center of attention, hoe smilin' 'coz they posted
