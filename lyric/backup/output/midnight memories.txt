1, 2, 3

Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
A big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk shh, but we don't listen

Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh-whoa

Midnight memories
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Baby, you and me, stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
