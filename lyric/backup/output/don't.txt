Don't you hate hearin? that clock on the wall chimin', sayin' its time an'
Don't you just wish we could stay right here together all day long?
You know it wouldn? t be a crime if we crawled back in the bed
Got as close as we could get
Tried to figure out where this thing is goin?

Baby, baby, don? t, don? t you say you? re leavin?
Why don? t you stay a little bit longer?
Got it goin? on and I just can? t believe it
