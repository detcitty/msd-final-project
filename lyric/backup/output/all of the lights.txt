All of the lights,
(lights, lights)
All of the lights

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

Fast cars, shooting stars
(All of the lights, all of the lights)
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
(All of the lights)
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

(All of the lights)
Cop lights, flash lights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights
