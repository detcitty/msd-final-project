Come inside, take off your coat
I'll make you feel at home
Now let's pour a glass of wine
'Cause now we're all alone

I've been waiting all night
So just let me hold you close to me
'Cause I've been dyin' for you girl
To make love to me

Girl, you make me feel real good
We can do it 'til we both wake up
Girl, you know I'm hooked on you
And this is what I'll do

(I wanna sex you up)
All night
