Yes, it was a beautiful day
It's gonna be a beautiful night
Break out the champagne, everybody get a glass
Let's start it off sexy
What do you say?
And all the ladies say (Uh-huh)

And all the ladies say (Uh-huh)
Think I like that

And all the ladies say (Uh-huh)

If you living that life the way you living

You can't live it any other way
I need you to put a bottle in the air right now
Welcome to the champagne life
Where trouble is a bubble in a champagne glass
Dreams and reality are one and the same
Don't act like you don't know the name
And we gone do it like this (Oh)
Got an addiction for life and this living
