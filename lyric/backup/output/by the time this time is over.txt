Silence takes over
Saying all we need to say
There's endless possibilities
In the moves we can make
Your kiss is giving every indication
If this heart of mine is right

By the times this night is over
The stars are gonna shine
On two lovers in love
And when the morning comes
It's gonna find us together
In a love that's just begun

By the time this night is over
Two hearts are gonna fly
To the heavens above
And we'll get closer
