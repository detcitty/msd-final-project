It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart, I feel it too
And no matter what I do, I feel the pain
With or without you

Baby I don't understand
Just why we can't be lovers
Things are getting out of hand
Tryin' too much but baby we can win

Let it go
If you want me, girl, let me know
I am down on my knees
