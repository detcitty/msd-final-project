From a town in Louisiana on the wrong side of the tracks,
came a rowdy Ragin Cajun by the name of Rupernac,
He was harder than a hickory long and thinner than a rail,
He was faster than a Copperhead and he werent afraid of hell,
He turned 18 in the Parish courthouse facin 10 to life,
about some altercation in a beer joint with a knife,
He said judge I mean your honor I hope you'll understand,
but if it happened here today I think I'd do it all again,
