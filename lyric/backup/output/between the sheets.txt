Hey girl ain't no mystery
At least as far as I can see
I want to keep you here
Laying next to me
Sharing our love between the sheets

Oh baby I feel your love surrounding me
Oh baby making love between the sheets

Oh girl let me hold you tight
And you know I'll make you feel alright
Oh baby girl just cling to me and let your mind be free
While making love between the sheets

Oh girl I love you all night long
And I know you felt it coming on
