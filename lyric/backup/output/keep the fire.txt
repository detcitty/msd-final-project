(Keep the fire bright)
There's a river in
The evening ember glow
And you're wishing you could see
How far it flows
Rolling on to an endless sea
You'd be well on your way
If you could only set sail

But dreams can drift away
And sails can fill with doubt
Where's your vision
If the embers flicker out?
Don't let it slip from view

The horizon's awaiting
Your river is fading

So keep the fire burning tonight
See just what comes into sight
