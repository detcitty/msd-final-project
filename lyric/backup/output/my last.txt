Hands up in the air
I just want the, I just want the baddest bitch in the world
Right here on my lap
And I'ma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'ma hit this night up like it's my last
I'ma I'ma, hmm, hmm, like it's my last
(Boi)
Swear I'ma, swear I'ma do it like
Like I never had it at
all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all
Like I, like I, like I never had it at
all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all
Okay, now where that alcohol? You ain't even got to ask
'Cause I'ma drink it all like, like it's my last
She a 7 in the face but a 10 in the ass
She even look better by the end of my glass
See I just walked in fresher than the shirts off in this muthfucka
I'ma need the baddest broad to twirk off in this muthafucka
I'ma go hard until it hurts off in this muthafucka
I'ma boss, so you gotta work off in this muthafucka
The work, and I can get you anything you want
I could, I could, I could put you on
See you look like Beyoncé so do it like beyond
Do it like Beyoncé and put it on Sean
Grind hard but a got a lot to show for it
