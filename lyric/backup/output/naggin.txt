What it is most us women we just good at what we do
but what yall needa remember is dont do what we do
you do what we tell you to do
c'mon

(Chorus Pt. I:)
Every now and then you get mad.
You treat me bad and it makes me sad.
Always in the Street Chasin' A$$.
That's why a Bitch be naggin'.

(Chorus Pt. 2 (Repeat 2))
Whomp (x5)
When you get here I'll be gone.
I'll always known I shoulda left ya a$$ alone.
That's why a bitch be

This is for them Niggas who be swearin' they aint catchin' no feelings.
Girls don't get ya self caught up in the mess.
Cuz half of them poppin'- the rest of them flex.
Yall. better pay attention.
Flaw gone put yall up on a lil' pimpin'.
Listen. When they flip the script.
You charge it to the hip & you take it to they whip.
Yea!
Ima tell you what I can't stand,
Is when I end up with a half a$$ man.
Gotta be like momma hold his hand.
I treat you like shit,
Cuz that's all you under stand.
All you care about is hoes & and them clothes & them shows.
Commin' home 3 and 4 every night.
Ain't got nan nother time,
Talkin' to me outta line,
When ya boys run you always wanna shine.
Yea.

(Chorus Pt. I:)
