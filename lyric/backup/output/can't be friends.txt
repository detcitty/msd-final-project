Look what this girl done did to me,
She done cut me off from a good, good love.

She told me that those days were gone (gone, gone, gone)
Now I'm sitting here going half crazy

'Cause I know she still thinks about me too,
And there ain't no way in hell, that I can be just friends with you (you, you, you)

And I wish we never did it
