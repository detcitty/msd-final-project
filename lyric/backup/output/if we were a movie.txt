Uh oh, there you go again
Talkin' cinetmatic
Yeah you! You're charming
You got everybody starstruck
I know, how you always seem to go
For the obivous, instead of me
But get a ticket and you'll see

If we were a movie
You'd be the right guy
And I'd be the best friend
That you'd fall in love with
In the end, we'd be laughin'
Watchin' the sunset
Fade to black, show the names
Play the happy song

(Yeah)

Yeah, yeah
