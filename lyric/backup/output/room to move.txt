I know it seems like I'm a million miles away
Sometimes you feel like you don't even know me
But in this world the pressure's building everyday
I need time to work things out, oh baby

It's not that I, don't love you, oh no
It's just that I, I've got to have
Room to move, that's all I need
That's all I ask for, room to breathe

Room to move, that's all I need
That's all I ask for
Give it to me, room to move
Everybody needs, room to move

Everybody needs some freedom to survive
