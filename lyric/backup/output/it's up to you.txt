I know we never meant to fall
The moment that my eyes met yours
Our hearts went tumbling
Before we knew what happened

And now that I am looking back
Ya know I get the feeling that
We started givin' up
Just to keep from givin' in

I still find hope in what little words we say
And I'm holding on in a big big way

So if you ever change your mind
