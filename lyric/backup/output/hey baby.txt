Hey baby, tell me why you hangin 'round
Ain't got time for kissin I'm too busy messin in this town
All you pretty women, you're so far an' in between
I don't need no fancy types I need the ones that's clean

Hey baby, jump into the back of my Ford
I'm gonna give you a ride baby, you never could afford
Hey baby
Hey baby
So
Follow me down the miles baby I'll show you the real love game.
