Black dress with the tights underneath
I've got the breath of the last cigarette on my teeth
And she's an actress(actress)but she ain't got no need
She's got money from her parents in a trust fund back east

Tongues always pressed to your cheeks, while my tongue
is on the inside of some other girl's teeth
And tell your boyfriend
If he says hes got beef that I'm a vegetarian
And I ain't fucking scared of him

She wants to touch me, woo hoo
She wants to love me, woo hoo
She'll never leave me, woo hoo woo hoo hoo
Don't trust a hoe
Never trust a hoe
Won't trust a hoe, cuz a hoe won't trust me

She wants to touch me, woo hoo
She wants to love me, woo hoo
She'll never leave me, woo hoo woo hoo hoo
