Honey, why you always smile
When you see me hurt so bad?
Tell me what I did to you, babe
That would make you act like that?

Well, I've been your fool before, honey
Yeah, and I probably will again
'Cuz you ain't afraid to let me have it
No, you ain't afraid to stick it in

Well, you know so many
Ways to be wicked
Ooh, but you don't know one little thing
About love
