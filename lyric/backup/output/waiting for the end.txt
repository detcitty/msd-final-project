Yeah, yo
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm and
Though the words sound steady, something's empty within'em
We say yeah with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
â€˜Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

Waiting for the end to come, wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control
Flying at the speed of light thoughts were spinning in my head
