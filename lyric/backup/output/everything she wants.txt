Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha
Oh, yeah oh, yeah
(to work to work...)

Somebody told me
Boy, everything she wants
Is everything she sees
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, baby
And now we're six months older
And everything you want
And everything you see
Is out of reach not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me
Oh

Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah ha, ah ha, doo doo doo la, la, la, la, la
Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah ha, ah ha, doo doo doo
La, la, la, la, la

Somebody tell me
Oh... (won't you tell me)
Why I work so hard for you
(give you money)
(work to give you money)
Oh

Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give and take
Well, you've shown me you can take
