I see you driving around town with the girl I Love
And I'm like
Fuck you!
Ooo oooh ooooh
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
And I'm like
Fuck you! And fuck her too.

I said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Ha now ain't that some shit?
(ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a...
Fuck you!
Ooo oooh oooooh

Yeah I'm sorry I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can get you there
I guess he's na Xbox
And I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

I pity the fool
That falls in Love with you
(Oh shit she's a gold digger)
Well
(Just thought you should know nigga)
Oooh oooh ooooooh
I've got some news for you
Go run and tell your little boyfriend
