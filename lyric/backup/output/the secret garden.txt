Tell me your secret
I don't just want to know about any secret of yours
Because tonight I want you to learn
All about the secrets in your garden

I wanna read your mind
Know you deepest feelings
I wanna make it right for you
Baby, show me
Let me share the mystery, oh

(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Listen to your heart tonight
(Come on, come on, come on)
Make it alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on, come out tonight)

I know a melody that we could sing together
I've got the secret key to you, baby
Let's make music, harmonizin' ecstasy
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Come on, sing it to me

Here in the garden where temptation feels so right
Passion can make you fall for what you feel
In the garden we can make it come alive
(We can make it come alive)
Every night
(Every single night)
Oh, woman your secret garden
