Ready,
Set,
Let's,
Roll,
Let's,
Roll

Damn, pretty girl you went done it again
You've gone and turned your sexy all the way up to 10
I've never seen a side ride seat looking so hot
Baby, you rock, hit the spot like a fireball shot
You've got me all high, head spinning around and around
I'm down if you're down to burn down this town

Ready set let's roll,
Ready set let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step
Shimmy up inside,
Just slide girl by my side girl
Yeah, we can run this town
I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down fog 'em up
Cruise around get stuck pedal to the metal
'Till the sun comes up
