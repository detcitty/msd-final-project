One look and I knew it was her, Even from across the street
Took forever for the light to change in that New York heat
I didn't want to lose her
So I reached out from behind
I wasn't ready for her thunder
Or the fire in her eyes

If looks could kill
I wouldn't have a breath left in me
Was she so scared of all those memories
Or did I take her by surprise
