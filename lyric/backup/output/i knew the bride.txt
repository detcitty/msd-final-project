Well the bride looked a picture
In the gown that her mama wore
When she was married herself
Nearly 27 years before
They had to change the style a little
But it looked just fine
Stayed up all night
But they got it finished just in time

Now on the arm of her daddy
She's walkin' down the aisle
I see her catch my eye
And give me a secret smile
Maybe it's too old fashioned
But we once were close friends
Oh but the way that she looks today
She never could've then

Well I can see her now
In her tight blue jeans
