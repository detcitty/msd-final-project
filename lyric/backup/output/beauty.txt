Sorry, didn't notice you there
Then again you didn't notice me
So we'll remain passers by
Until the next time we speak

I hope that I can make you mine
Before another man steals your heart
And once your beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
And beauty is her name

I'm hoping I can make you mine
Before another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart

It didn't take much time to think about
