So listen up

Let it go
La, la, la

If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go
(La, la, la)
If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go
(La, la, la)

If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go
(La, la, la)
If your girl wanna play, let her go

Hey baby girl, what you doin' tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store
Hey baby, givin' it your all when you're dancin' on me
I wanna see if you give me some more

Hey baby, you can be my girl, I can be your man
And we can pump this jam however you want
Hey baby, pump it from the side, bend it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back to the front

Hey baby
Ooh baby, baby, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
