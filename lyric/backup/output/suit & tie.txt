I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-looking
Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And owww burned myself, I just had to touch it
But it's so fire and it's all mine
Hey baby, and we don't mind all the watching, ha
Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozie when she does it

She's so fire tonight

And as long as I got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight

Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things

Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Hey
Stop, let me get a good look at it
