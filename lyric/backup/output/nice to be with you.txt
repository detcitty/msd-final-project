Oh, it's so nice to be with you
I love all the things ya say and do
And it's so nice to hear you say
You're gonna please me in every way
Honey, I got the notion
You're causin' commotion in my soul

Baby, you and me have got somethin' that's real
I know it's gonna last a lifetime
Aww, ya better believe it, girl
