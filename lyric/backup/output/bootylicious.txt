Kelly, Can you handle this?
Michelle, Can you handle this?
Beyonc√©, Can you handle this?

I don't think they can handle this!
Barely move, we've arrived

Lookin' sexy, lookin' fly

Baddest chick, chick inside

DJ, Gemini
Spotted me, attentive thang

There you are, come on baby
Don't you wanna dance with me

Can you handle, handle me?
You gotta do much better
If you gonna
Dance with me tonight
You gotta work your jelly
If you gonna
Dance with me tonight
Read my lips carefully
If you like what you see
Move, groove, prove
You can handle me
By the looks I got you
Sup and scared of me
Buckle your seatbelt
It's time for takeoff
I don't think you
Ready for this jelly
