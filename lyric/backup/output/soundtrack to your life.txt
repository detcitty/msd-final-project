If you can hear me
know that I'm right here
I heard your heartbeat
It took away the fear
'Cause my life is sliding
I tried to ride the wave
It came down crashing, it's time to start again
Backwards to go forward
Left at every corner
Been there and back again
And when the music ends

Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback
