If I said you have a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me
If I swore you were an angel,
Would you treat me like the devil tonight
If I were dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me
If I said you have a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me

Now we could talk all night about the weather
Could tell you 'bout my friends out on the coast
