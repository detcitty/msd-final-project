Don't talk to me
Don't talk to me, I'm serious
Ohh, you don't even know
Oh baby get it over
Now it's starting to show

Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind it's me and you baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down
Cause you changed me baby
Cause you changed me baby
Cause you changed me baby
Cause you changed me baby

Say I never settled down
I'm with you girl, look at me now
Cause you changed me baby
I be player for life
You switched that up in one night, oh baby
Ain't no sense in frontin' when you know I got a thing for you
Ain't no other girls in mind it's me and you baby, I love you
Used to be the kind of nigga never wanna settle down
