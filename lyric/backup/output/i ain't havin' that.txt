Starang: they don't like us
Rock: word up
Starang: they don't like us
Rock: they ain't gotta like us f**k them son

(starang)
Starang, forever like wu-tang, my crew brings drama
Hangin your ass upside-down by ya shoe strings
Smoke tell em how we doin this
Stop the whole shit just to big up my newness
(now by all means) I do a show in new orleans
And get wit bout it bout it mystikal (starang we been missin you)
Last year atl we almost got physical
I can't talk now read about it in the interview
(while y'all up in d&d) I caught two and three stitches
I was still gettin bitches in the tunnel takin pictures
In the mazda listenin to kris 'i got next'
I wanted "hot sex" so I ran and got the lex(aiyyo)

(rock)
Aiyyo shit goes down
Time to throw down show up this a showdown
So down low now I'm low down
Hold down the fort now wit a fo' pound
Blow down ya whole town first go round
Yo smile'll quickly be switched bitch and you'll frown
When I dig in ya pockets and take all the dope out
Lay ya gold out now and don't pronounce one word
Shut the f**k up probably cryin hold down
Tired of punk asses takin shit for a joke
Now watch you'll pounce gat pointed at yo door (pow)
Act like you know now
We could be so foul shake your hand run up in ya bitch no doubt

Chorus:

I ain't havin that - 4x

Shit yo game be asses I got two passes to the baja
Ah ha then turn into night we f**k
Yo cars superthug privelage
I ain't got to brag because I did it
Run before the rap when I was scrappin
