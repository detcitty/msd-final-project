Baby, what do you say, we just get lost
Leave this one horse town like two rebels without a cause
I've got people in Boston, ain't your daddy still in Des Moines?
We can pack up tomorrow, tonight, let's flip a coin

Heads Carolina, Tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
