You say a little love isn't enough for you
Sometimes I feel lucky just to get a little coming through

I weigh the differences everyday
Sometimes I feel like running away
A little love here makes me want to stay
A little love there will keep me from running away
A little love here, A little love there
Give a little, Get a little, Just a little love
A little love here, A little love there
