Love doesn't come with a contract
You give me this, I give you that
It's scary business, your heart and soul is on the line
Baby, why else would I be standing 'round here so tongue-tied
If I knew what I was doing, I'd be doing it right now

I would be the best damn poet, silver words out of my mouth

My words might not be magic but they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby, I'm in, I'm in, baby, I'm in, I'm in
Baby, come on in, the water's fine
I'll be right here, you take your time
