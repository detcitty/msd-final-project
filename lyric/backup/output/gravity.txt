In the twenty-first century, you can dance
Get your feet off the ground, get the dummy
And if you believe then you can fly
If a man can read, then he can reply
Hit it, gravity
Yeah, wait a minute, look here

Gravity, the big G
G R A V I T Y, gravity
Say it, gotten a hold on me

For the third verse, the sun
I've been trying to get the funky job done
Pull myself up and work that funk
Don't listen to the wrong honky tonk
