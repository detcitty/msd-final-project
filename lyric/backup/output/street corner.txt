On any street
Any street corner
On any street
Any street corner

They try to pick me up
And take me for a ride
I tell em no
The girl's satisfied

They say I've got the stuff
That really turns you on
I tell em no
This little girl is grown

They say fifi
And I say no, no, not me
I'm not the kind of girl
You are gonna see

On any street
Any street corner
On any street
