Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love and it's sure 'nuff a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around

When you were mine
Oh, I was feeling good
'Cause you lovlied up
This whole neighborhood

But now that you're gone
You know the sun don't shine
From the city hall to the county line
That's why I said
