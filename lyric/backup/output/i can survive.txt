Well, my teacher told me, "Boy, you're no good
Because you don't do what you should
You better shape up, or you're gonna fail"
But I said, "I'm leavin' 'cause this is a jail"

And I know what you're thinkin'
But don't pity me, oh no
I'll be better off out on my own

I can survive
I know that I can survive just fine
I said, I can survive
I said, I can survive on my own
