Like flames

Something you've heard, somewhere you've seen
Too real to ignore you've chosen not to believe
From the black of their pain to the white of their fear
In the dust they die while eden lies near

The freedom bought changed hands, was sold
This heat of love has turned ice-cold

We just can't escape it
