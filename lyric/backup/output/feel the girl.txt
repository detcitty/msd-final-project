Ms. Jade's the name comin' to ruin the game
Bringin' the thunder and rain, bus or a train or a plane
Me and my girls shrivel all over the world
Makin' you stumble and hurl, braids, ponytails and the curls
I got them folk pumpin' and movin' around
Jumpin' and gettin' it down, sweatin' and workin' it now
No question, gonna throw on them clothes tonight
So set them bows tonight, engines gon' hum on the bikes

No matter if he black, Puerto Rican or white
Stiletto heels tonight, free chicken wings and some rice
I got your dude lickin' my toes and stuff
What, what, what, what, what, light the chronic up
I know y'all gonna love when I do it
I do it professional like Duro and Clue, doin' it all for the loot
Y'all better get y'all asses up out the seats
Sweat runnin' down your cheeks, virgins turn into freaks

Frick feel the girl
 (Ms. Jade)
Frick feel the girl

She'll light the chronic up
 (Ms. Jade)

Frick feel the girl

Ya bet was lost, time to set it off
