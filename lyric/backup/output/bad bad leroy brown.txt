Well, the south side of Chicago
Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there, you better just beware
Of a man named a Leroy Brown

Now Leroy was in trouble
He stood about six feet four
All the downtown ladies call him 'Treetop lover'
All the studs they call him 'Sir'

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
