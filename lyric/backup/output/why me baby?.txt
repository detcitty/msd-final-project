(Why, why me, baby) Girl, I need to know why
(Why me, baby) What did I do, girl, what did I do
(Why, why me, baby)
You broke my heart

Check this out, honey
It seems like 99 years have gone by
Since the last time I talked to you, you know
I never realized that somethin' so innocent and so sweet
Could make a man feel so much pain
Times you'd jump out of my car and I'd chase you till I was out of breath
Go to your job and pick you up
But you never showed up that day
Where were you, baby
Who was you seein', it's a hurtin' feelin', sugar
How could you, why would you abuse my love, sweetheart
Cursin' me out in front of my friends
And I could never do anything to you
'Cause there was no way I could hurt somethin' I treasured so much
Thought I was right on time, but it seems like I was too late
You hurt me, baby
But hey, I'm man enough to admit it
