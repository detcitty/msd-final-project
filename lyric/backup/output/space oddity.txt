Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom (Ten, nine, eight, seven, six)

Commencing countdown, engines on (Five, four, three, two)
Check ignition and may God's love be with you (Two, one, liftoff)

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
