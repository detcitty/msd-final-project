Started out talking right here
Putting it down like a muthafuckin mack
Selling candy all up in my ear
She wanna be down like the D's on the lac
Slow dancing in the club
Diamonds look like rainbows
She grindin on my dick
She looking for the pot of gold
We hop up in the AMG indeed we in the western
She putting moves on me, I coulda swore shawty's a wrestler
Talking all that shit soon as I hit
Now I got her talkin like this

In a falsetto
She like ooh ooh baby
Aah aah aah ooh
In a falsetto
She like ooh ooh baby
Aah aah aah aah
In a falsetto
She like ooh ooh baby
Aah aah aah ooh
In a falsetto
She like ooh ooh baby
Aah aah aah aah

She telling all her homies I'm the real deal
