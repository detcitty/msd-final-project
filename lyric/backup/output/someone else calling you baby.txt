I saw a truck backin' out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messin' with the radio, you had your sun glasses on.
I pulled over cause I couldn't believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, just singing our songs
Everybody round our towns been whisperin'
A tear in your eye says I should have been listenin'

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This bein in the dark
