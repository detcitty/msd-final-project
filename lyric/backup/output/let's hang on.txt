There ain't no good in our goodbyes
True love takes a lot of tryin'
Oh, I'm cryin'

Let's hang on to what we've got
Don't let go girl we got a lot, we've got a lot
Got a lot of love between us
Hang on, hang on, hang on
To what we've got
To what we've got
To what we've got

You say you're gonna go and call it quits
Gonna chuck it all and break our love to bits
Break it up
I wish you'd never said it
Break it up
Oh, no we'll both regret it
