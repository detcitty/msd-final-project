Whoa oh oh oh ohhh
Whoa oh
(Here's to teenage memories)

Whoa oh oh oh ohhh
Whoa oh
(Here's to teenage)

Can I call, wake you up on a Sunday?
Late night, I think we need a getaway
Headlights, hold tight, turn the radio loud (turn the radio loud)
Let me know where to go and I'll get you there
Tell the truth and I'll show you how to dare
Flashlights, held tight, we can own this town

Never say goodbye
