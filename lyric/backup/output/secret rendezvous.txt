Happiness is when i, i think of you,
and we'll be gettin' together for a rendez-vous,
i'll be on time, you bring the wine,
and when we lock the door, you'll be all mine...
alone in my room, thoughts of you in my head as i wait...
the time is soon, you'll arrive, together then,
we'll escape into the night on wings of love,
and do the things that we onced dreamed of...
