Yeah, uh-huh {Bad Boy, 3LW, let's go}
Yeah, uh-huh

Rode up in the club like what
I got the VIP on lock down
Then I saw you starin' at me
The way we started to the back

You make me think that you're the one
Lickin' your lips at me for fun
While the DJ's makin' 'em sweat
Won't you come step to me

If you wanna get down, baby, I do
Holler at me, baby, uh-huh
If you're rollin' deep tonight
Then I do wanna know you

But if you wanna get down, baby, it's cool
Holler at me, baby, uh-huh
If your love is ridiculous
Then I do wanna get close to you
