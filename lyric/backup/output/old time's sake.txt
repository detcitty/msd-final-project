Good evening. This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of 4 million and a half feet
That's 8 million miles in the sky
Please undo your seat belt for take off
You are now free to smoke about the cabin
I'm Dre from back in the day from
N.W.A from black and the grey from
Chokin' a Mayson is a book butt I'm smacking her face from
Stackin' up bodies to racking AKs up from
Racking up hits to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happening in rap entertainment
Me and Shady far as competition faggot there ain't none
Speak of the devil
It's the attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blades vrun vrun they run away from
Who want to play dungeon no one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon the great one
Wait it ain't funny man, It's urgent I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paintgun
And a emergency squirtgun to spray A1
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (you are now smoking with the best, the best)
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
