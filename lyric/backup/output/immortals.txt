They say we are what we are
But we don't have to be
I'm bad behavior but I do it in the best way
I'll be the watcher (watcher) of the eternal flame

I'll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams
Oooooooh
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass glass (glass) (glass)

Oooooooh
I'll try to picture me without you but I can't
'Cause we could be Immortals, Immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now
