"OK roll the drums"

I want a girl
I wanna girl who always has the time
To set my world & count the stars above
I want a girl
I wanna girl who still believes in love
Someone who's sensitive enough
I want a girl
Oh I wanna girl that I can really trust
Someone who's patient & who'll love me when it's rough
I want a girl
I wanna girl as smart as she is fine
Someone that I can say is mine

This girl I'm describing really does exist
Baby have you noticed

I want a girl like you
To be with me tonight
I wanna kiss your lips & hold you close
If thats alright
I want a girl like you
To keep me feeling new
I wanna make the words you say the most
"I love you"
And your love is all I'll ever need

I want a girl
