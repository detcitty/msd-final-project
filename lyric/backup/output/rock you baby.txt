Met you in a cafe
At a table meant for two
You were sittin' by your lonesome
And I sat down with you
You tried hard not to show it
But I couldn't help but see
That you wore a broken heart out on your sleeve
And your lonliness
could not disguise
The beauty and the charm
Thought if I ever get you,
Shattered lady in my arms

(Chorus)
