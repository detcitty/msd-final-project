(- Prince Teddy)
What is time?
Time is when a man is trying to make time with your woman,
But you're doing time behind bars and your time is standing still
Yo Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?

(1 - Frost)
Time, sifts through the hourglass, through night and day
And I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
And if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit (yeah)
I've seen the manifestations of the street
So I can manifest what I've seen on a drum beat
Like just last night (yo what happened)
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
One of them was quick to pull a knife
He stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
In prison at the age of 21 (yeah)
Living on death row cause he couldn't let go
Caught in the web of violence (damn)
Roll deep when they creep, and move in silence of the lambs (yo)
A tattooed tear dropped as the iron gates slam

Ain't no sunshine - Frost
Ain't no sunshine - Bill Withers
Ain't no sunshine - Frost
