Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions or other people's quotes."

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love and understanding, and positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat
And away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree
But lord knows everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
