She hangs around the boulevard
She's a local girl with local scars
She got home late
She got home late
She drank so hard the bottle ached
And she tried
And she tried
And she tried
And she tried
But nothing's clear in a bar full of flies
So she takes
And she takes
She takes
And she takes
She understands when she gives it away
She says

Man, I gotta get outta this town
Man, I gotta get outta this pain
Man, I gotta get outta this town

Outta this town and outta L.A.

She's got a gun
She's got a gun
