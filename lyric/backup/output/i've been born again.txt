I've been born again, I'm a brand new man
Kind of brand new, I've been born again
Saturday night in the city, parties on every block
It's a temptation for a man who loves to party
But my party days had to stop

So brothers, you can keep your street life
Changin' women like you change your clothes
'Cause every woman I need, she's wrapped up in one
My love just grows and grows

Well, a whole lot of women is an ego trip
I'd rather spend my time kissin' baby's sweet lips
