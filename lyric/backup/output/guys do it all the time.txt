(bobby whiteside/kim tribble)

Got in this morning at 4 a.m.
You're as mad as you can be
Well I was drinking and talking and you know how that goes
Time just slipped away from me
By the time I knew what time it was
It was too late to call home
Stop carrying on acting like a child
I wasn't doing anything wrong

Guys do it all the time
And you expect us to understand
