Everytime I see you, baby
I think you're all aflame
Everywhere I see you darlin'
Girl you are so vain

When you're talkin', talkin' sexy
Sexy all the time
I just want to kiss your red lips
Girl you blow my mind

Because I'm love struck, love struck
Said over you, oh
Everybody knows I am love struck, love struck
Said over you, oh oh baby

Every time I think I need you
You're busy on the line
Everybody says they want you
Makes me so uptight

On my knees I try to tell you
