It's my third cup of coffee
Fifth time I've said I'm sorry
The sun slowly peaking through the glass
Says we been up all night

We both know where this is going
It's been a long time coming
Is it really over?
Is this really goodbye?

Maybe I should say something
Maybe you'd change your mind
Maybe, maybe
Buy a little more time

But I got nothin'
