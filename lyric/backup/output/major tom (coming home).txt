Standing there alone, the ship is waiting
All systems are go,
are you sure?

Control is not convinced
But the computer has the evidence
No need to abort
the countdown starts,
watching in a trance
the crew is certain

Nothing left to chance, all is working
Trying to relax, up in the capsule
"Send me up a drink", jokes Major Tom
