Home is where my heart is still beating
I don't know when i'll see her again
I hate to see her cry when I'm leaving
But now I'm a thousand miles away again

She feels like Carolina (feels like Carolina)
Looks like California (looks like California)
Shining like those New York lights on Broadway
When she looks back I'm behind her
I'll always be there for her
She makes me feel like home's not so far away
She feels like Carolina
