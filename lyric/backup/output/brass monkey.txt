That funky Monkey
Brass Monkey junkie

Brass Monkey

Got this dance that's more than real
Drink Brass Monkey here's how you feel
Put your left leg down, your right leg up
Tilt your head back let's finish the cup

M.C.A. with the bottle, D. rocks the can
Adrock gets nice with Charlie Chan
We're offered Moet, we don't mind Chivas
Wherever we go with bring the Monkey with us

Ad-Rock drinks three, Mike D. is D.
Double R. foots the bill most definitely
I drink Brass Monkey and I rock well
I got a castle in Brooklyn that's where I dwell
