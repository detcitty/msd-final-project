Midnight and I'm a-waiting
On the twelve-oh-five
Hoping it'll take me
Just a little farther down the line

Moonlight
You're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breaking
If it's only for a very short time

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

Laying out another lie
