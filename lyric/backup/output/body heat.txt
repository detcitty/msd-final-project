I know that I could not survive
All alone in isolation
I got to get to my body heat
From the many people I know

I got to have a steady flow
Of voices and pretty faces
I stay in crowd places
'Cause I need the body heat

Gimme, gimme your body heat
Save me from the blizzard
Gimme, gimme your body heat
Save me from the cold
