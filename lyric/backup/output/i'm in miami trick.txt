When I step on the scene
Y'all know me
'Cause I walk with a limp
Like a old school pimp, oh real, oh G
I'm rocking vans
I'm in the sand
I've a got a red bull and vodka up in my hand
Hey, you're looking kind of cute 
In that polka dot bikini, girl
Hey, that's what I want to do (what)
Take off that polka dot bikini,  girl

Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in Miami trick
Drink all day
Play all night
Let's get it poppin'
I'm in Miami Trick

Everybody on smash (smash)
Hands in the air (air)
I'm feelin on her ass (ass)
Like a nigga don't care (like a nigga don't care)
I've gotta a plan
What's your cell
