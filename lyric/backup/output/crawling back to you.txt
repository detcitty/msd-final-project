Lessons learned and bridges burned to the ground
And it's too late now to put out the fire
Tables turned
And I'm the one who's burning now
Well I'm doing all right till I close my eyes
And then I see your face and it's no surprise

Just like that, I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would, yeah
Swallow my pride, I'm crawling back to you
Yeah, I'm out of my head, can't wait any longer
I'm down on my knees, I thought I was stronger
