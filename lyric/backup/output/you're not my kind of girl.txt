Oh girl I know that you're attracted to me
And I should feel the same about you
There's just something wrong, I don't know what it is
That keeps us from becoming a two

It's not your looks, you're very pretty
It's not your style, the way you dress is oh so fresh
It's not the way that you carry yourself

Oh, girl I'm sorry, you're not my kind of girl
'Cause you're the kind of girl
That a man's dreams are made of

Oh girl I'm sorry, you're not my kind of girl
