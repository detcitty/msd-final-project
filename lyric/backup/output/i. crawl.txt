Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone

Who am I?
Rec League, I ain't payin' to ball
Y'all B-string like a broke guitar
And I still put it down like the family dog
Yeah. I murder some, I murder one
Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
