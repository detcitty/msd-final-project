Just shoot for the stars if it feels right
Then aim for my heart if you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid, my ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this

Take me by the tongue, and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk, and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes, and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
