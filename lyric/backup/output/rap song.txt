Nappy Boy, ooh, wee
Ooh wee
Everybody say yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Hey, eh, eh, eh, eh

We been messin' 'round for a long
(Long time)
A while now
(While now, uh)

And you already know what's on my mind
(Mind)
It's goin' down now
(It's goin' down now)

And I don't need no background music, girl
I turn it loud now
I got the gangsta feelin'
And I'mma do somethin' to you
To you, to you
Oh

We can take it over The Bay
Where my Mistah F.A.B. at?
(F.A.B. at, uh?)
Or just put on that N.W.A.
Comin' straight outta Compton on that pussy, baby

And we can all night long
(Ha, ha)
I'm 'bout to have yo head gone
And I ain't doin' nothin' wrong
But we can make love to a rap song

Me and you, yo mama and yo cousin
Baby, we can make love to a rap song
A milli, a milli, a milli, a muthafucka, I'm ill
Baby, we can make love to a rap song

Go, shawty
(Uh)
It's ya birthday
(Uh)
We gon' party like it's ya birthday

Where that new Jeezy CD?
Put on that Yo Gotti
I'm diggin' in ya coochie
While we listenin' to Gucci on a rap song

And you been on my mind all day
(All day)
