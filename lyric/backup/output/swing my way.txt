Oh, yeah, oh

[1:]
Shorty swing my way
You sure look good to me
Now would you please
Swing my way
Shorty swing my way

I stepped off in a club on a Friday night
Lookin' for a man that would do me right
First move that I made was on the dancefloor
But got down one time, then I went down for mo'
Physical action was happenin' at
Saw this young playa dip through the crowd
Looked over to my left and told my girl, hey
If I see him again I'mma have to say
And I'mma have to say

[Repeat 1]
Swing it over here shorty
[Repeat 1]

I got off the floor tryin' to find this man
Lookin' all around doing all I can, damn
He sure look (fine)
By the end of the night he's gonna be (mine)
