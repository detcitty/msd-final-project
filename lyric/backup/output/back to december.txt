I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while

You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
