I'm still here.
You want me to buy you Victoria's Secrets?
I can do that.
You want sex twice a day... Everyday?
Yo, I can do that.
Be careful what you say,
'Cause I'm right around the corner...
Check it out

Caramel eyes, chocolate thighs
Your honey brown
Complexion makes my nature rise
But you don't understand
You got me feinding for your candyland (yes you do)
Your voice is warm on a cold night
my cell phone bill is running out of control
So, as I talk to you, I,
hop in my whip and bring this. to you
And you're gonna find I'll.

Sex you from head to toe
I'll kiss you where your man just refuses to go
And if you don't know, baby, now you know
Girl, I can do that. I can do that
Lady come ride with me
