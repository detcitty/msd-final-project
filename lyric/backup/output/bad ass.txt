I'm feeling like a man of the hour, tear down the house
Throwing this money like it's no running out
Okay, but I wanna know, can you get any higher?
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass

I'm feeling like the man of the hour, host of the evening
But girl, this your show, now bring it back, rerun
I got pockets of hundreds, they say that change is irrelevant
Looking up in the sky I say I love watching you elevate
Get high as you ever been (go), we getting hella bent (go)
Ball so hard, I deserve me a letterman
Now then let me see that cake, cake, cake, like Entenmann's
Ass up, gon' take it down like a sedative
That's a negative, ain't nobody wetter than
Better get familiar like a motherfuckin' relative
Know you see the fireworks, you looking where my section is
All this money falling in the air like it's confetti, bitch

I'm feeling like a man of the hour, tear down the house
Throwing this money like it's no running out
Okay, but I wanna know, can you get any higher?
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
