When I was a boy, just about-a eighth-a grade
Mama used to say, don't-a stay out late
With the bad-a boys always shoot-a pool
Gonna flunk-a school

Boy, it make-a me sick all the things I gotta do
Can't-a getta no kicks, always gotta follow rules
Boy, it make-a me sick, just-a make a lousy bucks
I gotta feel like a fool
(And mama used to say)
