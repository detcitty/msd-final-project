Normally I would wanna go fast (ooh baby)
Now I know that you women don't like that way (ooh baby)
I'm so sorry (girl I'm so sad)
And now I've learned that
How to 'ppreciate you

Like it slow
Like it slow (slow)
Like it slow
Like it slow
Said humpin' fast, that ain't gon' go
Like it slow
Don't you know they like it slow
Like it slow
That humpin' fast, that ain't gon' go
Like it slow
Don't you know they like it slow
Yeah baby

I can feel your touch
Every time you move back with yo' push
And it feels so wet
Then I get my slow motion right back
(Ooooh, I wanna love your body slow)
Every time I count a punch
And the rules go, always slow, toe to toe
If you don't know they don't like dat rat a tat
