New York to the heart but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam

Hoe, damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat

Splat like Deja Vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Don P, Mo' with pistol
Just 'cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should mis doubt

Keep 'em near da fifties and hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich but bitch, I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope

Friends call me Gunz, sons call me Trife
'Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee, Peter knows how to eat her and beat her

Niggaz in the Bronx call me Lex
'Cause I push a Lex and I rock a Rolex
And I lounge on Lex' and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin' to flex
Like Dex, nigga, God rest your soul
But when you're playin' cards for Gunz, it ain't time to fold, hoe
