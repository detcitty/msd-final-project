Spoken)
Hold on this song has a little introduction to it
It's ain? t supposed to be sad though you might feel it that way
It's a song about desperation,
Every now and then we do get desperate

This is a song about L-O-V-E,
and if you abuse it you're gonn' lose it

you're gonn' to be sitting there on your little. machine
tryin to look and keep it clean and

segwayin right into the Tomorrow show
but that don't got the go so you turn it off ya turn on the radio,

"Hey Man, I can't lickety split"
You start to open up a little book
and there's somethin there you got to overlook
and you say "BABY, you know there's somethin on my mind!
"You say "Baby there's somethin on my mind -
I know that you're home and I know you aint all alone! "

So you start walking over to her house
and you get over to her house
and you walk over to her door and
you start poundin on her door and you say
"Open up the door bitch!?
This is wooba gooba with the green teeth, let me in!"

Well, she opens up the door
and then you just kinda walk up to her and say
