When you look at me, i know you see
a 15 year old, gettin his dough
back and fourth to the studios
hoppin ROUND limosines, rockin the latest jeans
jordans, fresh, t-shirts, new
and even though these things are true
its hard work and sometimes i just wanna go home and...
tell my girl to braid my hair...

(chorus)
C'mon and braid my hair
back in my hood, feelin good
no worries or no cares
