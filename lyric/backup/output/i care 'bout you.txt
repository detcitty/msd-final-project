Sometimes I feel so alone
I call your heart
But there's no one at home
Taking a toll on my pride, pride
I'm reaching out
But there's no one inside
You know it doesn't feel right, when I look in your eyes
I know love is blind, but the heart doesn't lie
I'll ask one more time, maybe this time you'll try
So tell me girl what's deep in your heart
