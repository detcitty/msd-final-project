What's really happenin'? This shit again for the 99
Silkk The Shocker, Mystikal and Craig B
It still ain't my fuckin' fault, ya heard me?

(Uh, oh)
Oh, it ain't my fault, it ain't my fault
(Did I do that? Did I do that?)
It ain't my fault
(Did I do that? Did I do that?)

That's right my meat and potatoes come from my lyrical label
I throw my rhymes for No Limit like Jeff George throw for the Raiders
Don't cut the head off a hater, don't cash the check that they paid ya
Jump in a Deville or Mercedes, Lexus or Navigator

Five hundred niggas talkin' 'bout what they gon' do
How they gon' ruin my day, not none of them niggas
Be talkin' like that when they come round my way
Hold your mouth as tight as you can, whatever, you don't loosen your lip
I make your tightest hardest rapper brush his teeth with my dick

I'm strict, I'm rich, I'm young, I'm black, I'm set
I got it, I hold it, I run it, I do it to death
I'm hot, I'm dirty, I'm oiled, I'm strapped, I'm done
Don't blame it on me if the police find a pistol and blunt

(Uh, oh)
Oh, it ain't my fault, it ain't my fault
(Did I do that? Did I do that?)
It ain't my fault
(Did I do that? Did I do that?)
