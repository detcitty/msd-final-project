Well the glow from the bars and a
Thousand stars
Light the cold Ohio night
And the Turnpike's slick, the
Snow's as thick as thieves
Since your call came through there
Ain't nothing new
But the radio and the headlights
And the news at the top of the hour
That no one really believes, 
Do they

(CHORUS:)
Lover... what you want to go and do
That for
Lover... why'd you want to tear it
Apart
