Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

First time I saw you, baby
I knew right away I wanted you for my lady
I had to rush right over to you [Rush to you]
And ask you if you felt the same way too

Now we've known each other many a night
And I want you to know my intentions are right
For making you my lady
The one and only lady in my life [In my life]

I wanna be two places at the same time
