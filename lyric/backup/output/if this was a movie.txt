Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking about everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Standing in the rain outside until I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
