Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why do you have to go
Away from home
Me love

Uh uh uh uh oh ooh
Why do you have to go
Away from home
Me love

See the first time me looking at your eyes
Me be tell you wants a guy like me
We use to have good times on the evening
Me and you chilling on da beach

We use to kiss and caress an chess me
Girl it feels so sweet
Then one day you move
Now I'm feelin kinda blue
Cause we had to see you leave

I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean
Somebody come and take me away
