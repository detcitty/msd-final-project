Just one more moment, that's all that's needed
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing
Time to be honest,
this time I'm pleading,

please don't dwell on it
cause I didn't mean it.
I can't believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground,
but it doesn't matter cause I made it up,

forgive me now.
Everyday I spent away my soul's inside out,
Gotta be someway that I can make it up to you now,

somehow.

By now you know that
I'd come for you,
no one but you.
