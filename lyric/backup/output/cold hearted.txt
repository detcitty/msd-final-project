He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh ohhh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no

You're the one givin' up the love
Anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off
and runnin' with the crowd

You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you
when he's out

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh ohhh
He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
