Hearts of fire
Streets of stone
Modern warriors
Saddle iron horses of chrome

Taste the wild, lick the wind
Like something they never saw before
Their jaws dropping to the floor
Steel made of soul and sin

And rebels born without a care
And the day he listens
Only to fly where eagles dare
And the night she whispers

Ride the wind
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun
