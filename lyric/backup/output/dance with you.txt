Dance with you
Dance with you
Dance with you
Dance with you

Dancing with you
Is all I want to do

Can't get you off my mind
Want to be with you all the time


(Dance with you)
Come on and dance with me baby
(Dance with you)
Make romance with me baby
(Dance with you)
I'm gonna I'm gonna
(Dance with you)
'Cause I wanna I wanna

Dancing the night away
Keep going to the break of day
Oh what I love can't you see [------not sure about this line... sorry]
Please come and go with me
