Uh huh, Yeaheee yeah, Get over,
Get over, (listen)
Yeah I was right there - like the "little wife"
I was everything that you need - always in line
I was livin' you-lovin' you-filling your desires
(that's right)
But that was then-this is now-look me in the eyes

Oh oh oh oh - if love could choose sides
Oh oh oh oh - it's taking mine, so

Get over yourself-goodbye(goodbye)
It must be hard to be you -yeah
Living in your life
I was always the one to cry
Now everything-everything-everything is all right
Get over yourself-know why(know why)
Cause without you see i do anything i like
Sometimes i stay out all night
And everything -everything-everything is all right

This just can't be it I kept telling myself
And every magazine said was me was on the shelf
