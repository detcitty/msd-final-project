Every time I fall I get back up again
Cinch my saddle up and find me another wind
Let it take me where it wants to go
Another one horse town, another damned old rodeo

I know this life is crazy
But I'll be home soon baby

I'll ride in on a sunny day,
Sing you a song, steal your heart away
Like a cowboy
Hang my hat like I'm here for a while
Kick off my boots and drive you wild
