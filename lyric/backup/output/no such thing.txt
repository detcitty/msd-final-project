Welcome to the real world
She said to me condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white

Well, I never lived the dream of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
