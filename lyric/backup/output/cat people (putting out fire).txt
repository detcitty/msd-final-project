See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long
Feel my love enraged
It's just the fear of loosing you
Don't you know my name
You've been so long

And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been thru
You've been so long
Well it's been so long

And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
