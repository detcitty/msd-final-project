(Fabolous talking before first verse)
Brooklyn, uh uh uh uh
Huh Huh uh huh do it huh Yea
Uh Uh do it huh huh what ya'll want huh

Rollin, gold two seater
Stash in the dash
Hole through heaters
Blockahhhhh put holes through beaters
Ghetto Fab stroll through Cheetahs
Ballin, Brooklyn don
Addicted to Cris' hooked on Dom
15 G's hookers on
Ma, I wanna see how you look in thongs
Hustlin, guys that send Po's
Cause I chop rocks the size of mentos
Blame me, trials aquit those
Look at the hurt your eyes will squit close
Pimpin' here's a new way to flirt
Listen to the two way alert
It goes (2 way beeps in song's beat)
Lets go VIP boo raise your skirt

(Chorus 1)
Holla back Young'n (Woooo Woooo!)
