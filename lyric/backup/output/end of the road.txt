Girl you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playing
With my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see

We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?

Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say good-bye?

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead
Spinning around and around

Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let you go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
