Oh baby please turn yourself around
Oh baby so I can love you good
Oh baby I'll make you feel so good
Oh sugar just like you want me to

Oh baby you sure love to ball
Oh baby you sure love to ball

Oh honey I hope you never freeze
I love you I love you so much
Oh baby baby don't ever go away
Stay with me baby, I'll love you night and day

Oh baby you sure love to ball
Oh honey you sure love to ball
