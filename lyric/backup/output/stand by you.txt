Hands
Put your empty hands in mine
And scars
Show me all the scars you hide
And hey, if your wings are broken
Please take mine so yours can open too
Cause I'm gonna stand by you

Oh, tears make kaleidoscopes in your eyes
And hurt, I know you're hurting, but so am I
And love, if your wings are broken
Borrow mine so yours can open too

Cause I'm gonna stand by you

Even if we're breaking down,
we can find a way to break through
Even if we can't find heaven,
I'll walk through hell with you

Love, you're not alone, cause
I'm gonna stand by you
