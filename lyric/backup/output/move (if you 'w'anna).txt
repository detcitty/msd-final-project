I don't understand how I can have so many ha-ters
Knowin I'm their father like my name is Darth Va-der
I can get you hemmed up while I'm bein tay-lored
Then I slide off to the side like a fa-der
HOMEY I'M THE PRESIDENT, GOVERNOR AND MA-YOR!
I CONTROL EVERYTHING, LIKE A DIC-TATOR!
GET YOU BIZ MARKED UP, TURN YOU INTO VA-PORS!
IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM GET YOU SWALLOWED LIKE A CHA-SER!
Model on my arm no homey I don't have to pay-her
