I'm feeling like Tonto
Riding a pinto
Trying to chase the Lone Ranger down
I'm a little unraveled
But I'm still in the saddle
Crying your name out to the clouds
Hey ya, hey ya

Why don't you meet me
Back at the teepee
We'll lay down by the campfire
There, in the dark night
We'll smoke a peacepipe
Forget about who's wrong or right
Hey ya, hey ya, hey
