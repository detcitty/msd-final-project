Ah, ah, you're beautiful
Ah, ah, you're beautiful

Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that
And a smile so bright
Oh, you're killing me

You know it ain't fair

Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that
