Melachi the Nutcracker:
Born in the ghetto it's hard to survive
Some have achieved and many brothers tried
But I realized which life to choose
I want to make money so I gotta pay dues
But there's no rules and you only have one chance
If ya fuck up kid you face the circumstance
At night I use to scream and shout
Livin' in the ghetto trying to get the hell out
So I would try as I watch my friends die
But all I could do was sit back and cry
These are feelings I'm expressing through my rhymes
I been through hard times so many problems on my mind
I wasn't living rich and I also wasn't poor
I try to appreciate but I deserve more
Yeah superman supa star
Give me super fat doe like Pablo Escobar
"Super duper star"
