One way love
Thought we had something

Girl, I can't get you out of my mind
Just one look, I knew you were one of a kind
Your love is hot, so give me all you got
I need your love, too much is not enough

One way love, thought we had something
Girl, you played me for a fool
Should have held back all my loving
Didn't know there were no rules
One way love, now I'm still crying
Tears are pouring like the rain
But I know I'll keep on trying
