Make it last, make it last forever, don't let our love end
Lets make it last, lets make it last forever and ever
Don't let our love end

Let me hear you tell me you love me
Let me hear you say you'll never leave me
Oh, girl, that would make me feel so right

Let me hear you tell me you want me
Let me hear you say you'll never leave me, baby
