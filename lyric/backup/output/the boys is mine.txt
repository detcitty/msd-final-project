Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?

Uh huh, sure you know, you look kinda familiar.

Yeah, you do too but, umm, I just wanted to know do you know somebody named
you, you know his name.

Oh, yeah definatly, I know his name.

I just wanted to let you know he's mine.

Huh... No no, he's mine!

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane

You see I know that you may be
Just be jealous of me
Cuz you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

You see I tried to hesitate
I didn't wanna say what they told me
He said without me he couldn't make
