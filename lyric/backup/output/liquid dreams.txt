Posters of love surrounding me, I'm lost in a world of fantasy
Every night she comes to me and gives me all the love I need

Now this hot girl
(Hot)
She's not your average girl
She's a morpharotic dream from a magazine
And she's so fine, designed to blow your mind

She's a dominatrix supermodel beauty queen, ooh

I dream about a girl who's a mix of Destiny's Child
Just a little touch Madonna's wild style
With Janet Jackson's smile, throw in a body like Jennifer's
You've got the star of my liquid dream
(My liquid dream)
Angelina Jolie's lips to kiss in the dark
Underneath Cindy C's beauty mark
When it comes to the test well Tyra's the best
