WHIRLY GIRL
OXO

Let me tell you 'bout the girl I know
She's been to Paris France
And she can dance
Like a spinning top
She's got no stop
She picks you up and then
She lets you drop
Listen

Ooo

Let me tell you 'bout the girl I know
'Cause she's really hip
And she can go go go
Like a straight shooter she's got her downs
Won't hesitate to put you on the ground
She's been with the Rolling Stones
On their tours
And in their homes
