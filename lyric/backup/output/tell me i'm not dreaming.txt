Tell me I'm not dreaming
Tell me I'm not dreaming
Midnight
Images of you
You slipped
Slipped into my room
Oh, could be magic
Could be fantasy
Could it be that we're in love
Tell me I'm not dreaming
Oh your voice
Whispers in the dark
You know, you're talk
Talking to my heart
Are you with me?
Am I here with you?
Are we in paradise?
Tell me I'm not dreaming
Or are you
Too good to be true
