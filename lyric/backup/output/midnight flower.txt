Midnight flower
You got the power
Let me buy the things you do, darlin'
For just one hour

You may never
Fall in love with me
But it don't matter
As long as you and I, darling
Can get together

I don't care
What people say you are
'Cause in my eyes, girl
You are a superstar

The way you move
Is like sweet music flowin'
And inside of me
There is a need that's growin'

No price is too high
