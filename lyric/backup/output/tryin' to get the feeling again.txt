Doctor my woman is comin' back home late today
Could you maybe give me somethin'?
'Cause the feeling is gone and I must get it back right away
Before she sees that I've been up down tryin' to get the feeling again

All around tryin' to get the feeling again
The one that made me shiver
Made my knees start to quiver every time she walked in
And I've looked high (high) low (low) everywhere I possibly can
But there's no (no) tryin' to get the feeling again
