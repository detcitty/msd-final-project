Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto
Himitsu wo Shiri tai
You're wondering who I am
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
Machine or mannequin

(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
With parts made in Japan
(Secret, secret, I've got a secret)
I am the modren man
I've got a secret, I've been hiding under my skin
My heart is human, my blood is boiling

My brain I.B.M., so if you see me

Acting strangely, don't be surprised
I'm just a man who needed someone
