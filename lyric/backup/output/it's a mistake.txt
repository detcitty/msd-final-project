Jump down the shelters to get away
The boys are cocking up their guns
Tell us general, is it party time?
If it is, can we all come?

Don't think that we don't know
Don't think that we're not trying
Don't think we move too slow
It's no use after crying

Saying it's a mistake
It's a mistake
It's a mistake
