Eh eh eh

Baby, you're looking fire hot
I have you open all night like an iHop
I take you home baby let you keep me company
You gimme some of you, I give you some of me
You look good, baby must taste heavenly

I'm pretty sure that you got your own recipe

So pick it up, pick it up, yeah I like you
I just can't get enough I got to drive through
Cause it's me, you, you, me, me, you, all night
Have it your, way, foreplay
Before I feed your appetite

Let me get my ticket baby, let me get in line
I can tell the way you like it, baby, supersize

Hold on, you got yours, let me give mine
I aint leave until they turn over the closed sign
Check it
Take my order cause your body like a carry out
Let me walk into your body until you hear me out
Turn me on, my baby dont you cut me out
Turn me on, my baby dont you cut me out
Take my order cause your body like a carry out
Let me walk into your body until it's light's out
