I'm wanting you too much
Don't take advantage of
My tender heart and everything about me
In giving you my trust
I'm giving you my love
So do take care, please be gentle with my heart

'Cause everything I do is 'bout you, baby
Baby, I don't wanna be apart, ooh
I've been loving you from the start
Here's my heart, here's my heart
Everything I do is all about you, baby

Whatever you do, whatever you think
I look in your eyes
You don't know how my heart aches
