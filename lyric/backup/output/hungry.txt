I hear the ticking on the clock
Counting everyday I've been alone
How long before you're coming back?
If I don't see your face, I'll turn to stone

Can't keep holding on this way
Can't go on another day
Can't you hear me when I say...

Chorus:
Girl I'm hungry, for your love
Girl I'm hungry, baby let me in
Hungry, for your love
Hungry, I can't get enough
