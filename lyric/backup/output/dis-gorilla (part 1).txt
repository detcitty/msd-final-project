Rick Dees: Went to a party the other night
All the ladies were treating me right
Moving my feet to the disco beat
How in the world could I keep my seat
All of a sudden I began to change
I was on the dance floor acting strange
Flapping my arms I began to cluck
Look at me.I'm the disco duck

Duck: Ah get down mama, I've got to have me a woman, ha ha ha ha ha
CHORUS: Disco, disco duck
