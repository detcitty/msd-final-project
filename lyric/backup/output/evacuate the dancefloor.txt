Turn up the music
Let's get out on the floor
I like to move it
Come and give me some more
Watch me getting physical, out of control
There's people watching me
I never miss a beat

Steal the night
Kill the lights
Feel it under your skin
Time is right
Keep it tight
Cos it's pulling you in
Wrap it up
Can't stop cos it feels like a overdose
(Feels like an overdose)

Oh, oh, evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ let the music take me underground

(Everybody in the club!)
Oh, oh, evacuate the dancefloor
Oh, oh, I'm infected by the sound
(Everybody in the club!)
Oh, oh, stop, this beat is killing me
Hey Dr. DJ come burn this place right down to the ground
