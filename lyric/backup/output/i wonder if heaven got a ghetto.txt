I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, 'cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass, mama whupped my ass

Was it my fault, papa didn't plan it out
Broke out left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Down the block, got a glock and I clock grip

Makin G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella,
Just to live large like Rockefeller

First you didn't give a fuck but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
God damn it's a motherfuckin' riot
Black people only hate police so don't try it

If you're not from the town then don't pass through
'Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right but it's long overdue
We can't have peace till the niggaz get a piece too

I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
