You're so good
I hadda come back for more
I hadda have it one more time
You're so good, you're so fine
That I hadda have it

Ever since I met you
I been dying for to pet you
And I'm coming out to get you
Cause I never had it
Better than you, babe
I'm telling you true, babe

Girl, you got me ga-ga
Thinking bout your little ya-ya
