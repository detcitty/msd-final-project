I love when you pulling up in your jeep
Bumping all your beats
J's on with your shades on
Just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets
But when it comes to my heart

That don't mean a thing no oh
Baby hop in my ride
Ooh it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down
With your doors closed
With my hand up on your thigh
Drive slow ooh
Take your time

Every little thing you do
Got me feeling some time of way
When you give me that thunder
You make my summer rain

Oh-oh-oh oh oh
Oh-oh-oh oh oh

Everyday everyday
And it won't stop
Boom Boom Boom
And it won't stop
Boom Boom Boom

With every single part of me
My love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat
On repeat
And it won't stop
Boom, Boom, Boom
