Well, here you come again and you're looking so fine
You don't notice me but it's alright
I'm just a guy who wishes that I could be your man someday

Yeah, a picture paints a thousand words, it's true
But it's still not enough for how I feel about you
I wanna put you in a melody, I gotta set you to a groove

I wanna put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud
Roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl

If I could press play, repeat, how happy I'd be
