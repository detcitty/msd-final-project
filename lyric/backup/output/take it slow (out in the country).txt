Tired of bein' pushed, bumped and turned around
Listenin' to the people fightin' next floor down
Tryin' to find fresh air to breath, just can't be done, no
I gotta get away and get some country sun
Look to the sky, the stars are outta sight
Hidden by the cloud of the city's might
Hear the sirens blowin' all over town
Well now, I gotta get away and get some country sound
