Yuck Daddy! Yuck!

Yuck Daddy! Yuck!

Uh, cut the top off, call it Amber Rose
Just bought a big body
time to paint the toes
Known to act a donkey on the camel-toe
Then take the camel-toe
and turn it into casserole
2 Chainz talkin' on the FLX phone
Poof! Just like that the whole check gone
Former Posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look
like my neck gone
My girl came through and brought an extra body
Now that's an after party
for the after party
Two-gun game
all-black Ferrari
His and her Armani
put it in a tonic
And yeah, the bread good if the head good
Before Benihana's it was canned goods
Before canned goods
it was Similac
I'm from where they send shots
Then we send 'em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Wrap your parents up
Now you got a black mommy
Yeah I did it
True to my religion
Two guns on me
Both with extensions
If you on the pole
Play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
Corduroy Trues
With the skull cap
