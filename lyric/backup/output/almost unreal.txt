Aaaaah
Babe
Come in from the cold
And put that coat to rest
Step inside
Take a deep breath
And do what you do best
Yeah
Kick off them shoes
And leave those city streets
I do believe
Love came our way
And fate did arrange
For us to meet

I love when you do
That hocus-pocus to me
The way that you touch
