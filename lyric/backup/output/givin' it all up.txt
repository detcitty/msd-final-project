Oh yeah... mmm
I've had lots of kisses Honey but not like yours
I had sweet lovin' but not like yours
I'm tired of this running, all over town
I finally found good love, to keep around
I'm givin' it all up for your Babe
I'm givin' it all up for you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
I'm givin' it all up for you
I've done lots of crazy things before
But i don't want no crazy love no more
For the people that i met, I seem to forget
As long as I got you Honey, as long as i got you
