Woke up this morning
And I couldn't get out of bed
Felt like this heavy band
Were playing in my head
They were screaming through the ceiling
Screaming through the walls
Stealing all my photographs
And laughing at them all
I phoned the man at work
And this is what I said
I woke up this morning
And I couldn't get out of bed
