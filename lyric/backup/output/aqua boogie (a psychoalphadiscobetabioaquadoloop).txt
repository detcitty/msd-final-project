Ha ah, ha ah, ha ah
I am Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk
I can't swim, I never could swim
I never will swim

Oh, put me down
Let go my leg
I told ya, will you shut up
I told ya I can't swim, ha ho no

Put me down, I hate water, ho
(Hah, ah hah, ah hah, ahh)
Will you shut up

(Aqua boogie, baby)
Never learned to swim
(Underwater boogie baby)
Can't catch the rhythm of the stroke
(Aqua boogie, baby)

Why should I hold my breath
(Underwater boogie, baby)
Feelin' that I might choke
(Ha ah, ha ah, ha ah)
(Aqua boogie, baby)

Things ya blow through
Because of things ya swim through
(Underwater boogie, baby)
Why hold your nose to spite your face
(Ha ah, ha ah, ha ah)
(Aqua boogie, baby)

With the rhythm that makes you dance
To what we have to live through
(Underwater boogie, baby)
You can dance underwater and not get wet, oh
