(chorus)
Things just ain't the same
He could never be you
You should know the pain I feel
Understand what I'm going through

Saw you the other day
and I almost lost my mind
I remember the things we did
I can't believe, such a waste of time

Sometimes I wanna cry
Sometims I wanna die
Please help me understand
Why can't my heart just lie

(Chorus)
Things just ain't the same
He could never be you
