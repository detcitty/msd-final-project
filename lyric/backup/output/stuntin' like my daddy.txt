[Hook - Lil Wayne]
Vroom on'a yamaha, chromed out 11 hunn'ed
What I'm doin, gettin money, what we doin, gettin money
What dey doin, hatin on us, but dey never cross
Cash Money still da company, en bitch I'm da boss
En I be stuntin' like my daddy, stuntin' like my daddy
Stuntin' like my daddy, I be stuntin' like my daddy
I'm da, yung stunna, stuntin' like my daddy
Stuntin' like my daddy, I be stuntin' like my daddy
[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Yea bitch I'm paid, das all I gotta say
Cant see'ya lil niggas - da money's in da way
En, I'm sittin high, a gansta ride blades
If you aint gonna ride fly den you may as well hate, shit
I gotta eat. yea even though I ate.
En'no it aint my birthday but I got my name on da cake. shit
Believe dat en if ya mans wanna play
Imma fuck 'round en put da boy brains on da gate. hey
Pick 'em up, pop'em-let-em-lay
Where I'm from u see'a fuckin dead body er'yday
Das, uptown, throw a stack at 'em
Niggas talk about me, I'm th'owin' shots back at 'em (pop)
Ya bitch on my pipe, she-like a crack addict
If she saw me cookin' eggs, she thought I was back at it.
I grab da keys, hoe I gotta go
I got my motorcycle jacket en my motorcycle loafs
