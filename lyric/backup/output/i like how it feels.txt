it's my time It's my life
I can do what I like
For the price of a smile, I gotta ticket to ride.
So I keep living, 'cause it feels right

And it's so nice, and I'd do it all again
This time, it's forever
It gets better, and I I, I like how it feels

I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels

So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes and no, never stop
