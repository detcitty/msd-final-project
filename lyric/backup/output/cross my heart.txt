Cross my heart
Hypnotized, with just one look at you, I'm paralyzed
I can't explain why just one touch of you drives me insane
You've got me head over heels
You better believe it
Baby, and I know how it feels

Cross my heart
Hope to die
May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart
I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone more than I'm loving you
Cross my heart, it's true

Heavenly, something happens when you're next to me
