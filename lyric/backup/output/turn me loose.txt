I was born to run
I was born to dream
The craziest boy you ever seen
I gotta do it my way
Or no way at all

And I was here to please
I'm even on my knees
Making love to whoever I please
I gotta do it my way
Or no way at all

And then you came around
Tried to tie me down
I was such a clown
You had to have it your way
Or no way at all

Well I've had all I can take
I can't take it no more
I'm gonna pack my bags and fly
My way
Or no way at all
