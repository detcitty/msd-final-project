C'mon man

And with the local DDC news, LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback

but tonite...

Don't call it a comeback I been here for years
I'm Rockin' my peers Puttin' suckers in fear
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowerin'
Over the competition, I'm towerin'
Records shock When I drop
these lyrics That'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare
You betta move Don't ever compare

me to the rest They'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's payin' the price

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out

Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Don't you call this no regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Mohammad Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this
Beat like a skull Dontcha know I gotta beef wit'
Why don't you rip with
