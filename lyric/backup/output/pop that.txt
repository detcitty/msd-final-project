Drop that pussy bitch
What ya twerkin with

I'm some young papi, champagne
They know the face, and they know the name
(Drop that pussy bitch)
What you twerkin' with?

Work, work, work, work, bounce
What you twerkin' with

Work, work, work, work, work, work
What you twerkin' with
Throw it, buss it open
Show me what you twerkin with
Ass so fat, need a lap dance
I'm in that white ghost chasin' Pac man
Hundred out the lot, I be leaning that's a rock
Hundred large bring a mop
Cars tinted like Barack
Got a brinks truck in my pocket (pocket)
30 chains on my collar (collar)
2 drops, no mileage
Top off like Wallace
And I'm hella smoke, bitch know that
Filthy rich before rap
Your new deal, I throw that
3 Benz I'm on that
We pop a molly, she buss it up
She seen it, got it, that pussy soaking

I love my big booty bitches
My life a Godfather picture
