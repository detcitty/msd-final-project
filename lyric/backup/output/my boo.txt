Boy you should know that
I got you on my mind
Your secret admirer
I've been watching you

At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, baby
If your game is on, give me a call Boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you

At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, baby
If your game is on, give me a call Boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you

Every day I pray my heart can win
Every night I pray I can call you my man, yeah yeah yeah
I need you, I want you
To have you, hold you, squeeze you
So I'm going out every weekend
Just to see my Boo again
