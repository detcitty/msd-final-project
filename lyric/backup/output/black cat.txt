All the lonely nights, I spend alone
Never around to love me, you're always gone
'Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules
Oh, the man has come looking for you
You're a rebel now, don't give a damn
Always carrying on with the gang
I'm trying to tell you, boy, it's a mistake
You won't realize 'til it's too late
Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
