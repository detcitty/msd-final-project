Put up, what up, bo bo bo
Suckers want to flow
But they got no show
So I'm a grab the mic
Flip a script and leave you stunned
Buckshot's the one
That gets the job done

Mic check, I get
Paid to wreck your set
Get ready to jet
Cause I'm a threat to your fret
No holds barred
And complete move fakers
Best to be the backup
Watch your girl, I might take her

If she's a crab
I'm a diss her and slide
If she try to riff
I got my Smith on my side
Word to God
Here I come, so make way
Rugged and rough
Killing your set every day

Microphone check
One, two, here we go
And I'm a let you know
Who got the flow
Spitting my verbs like
An automatic weapon
Suckers keep stepping
Cause I'm a let you know

[CHORUS]
Who got the props
Who got the props
5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot

[Repeat CHORUS 3x]

One Mississippi, two Mississippi
Sucker tried to diss me
Ao I played him like
A hippie from the 60's
