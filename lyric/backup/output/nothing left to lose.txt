something's in the air tonight
the sky's alive with a burning light
you can mark my words something's about to break

and I found myself in a bitter fight
while I've held your hand through the darkest night
don't know where you're coming from but you're coming soon

to a kid from Oregon by way of California
all of this is more than I've ever known or seen

come on and we'll sing, like we were free
push the pedal down watch the world around fly by us
