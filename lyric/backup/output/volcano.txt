Now I don't know
I don't know
I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows

let me say now
Now I don't know
I don't know
I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows

Ground she's moving under me
Tidal waves out on the sea
Sulphur smoke up in the sky
Pretty soon we learn to fly

let me hear ya now
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know where I'm a-gonna go when the volcano blows
