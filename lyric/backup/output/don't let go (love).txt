What's it gonna be 'cuz I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
You have the right to lose control
Don't let go

I often tell myself that we could be more than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon it would all end
I live in misery when you're not around
And I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows

There'll be some love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin' love
Love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin'...

What's it gonna be 'cuz I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
