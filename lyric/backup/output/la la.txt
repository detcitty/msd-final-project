You can dress me up in diamonds
You can dress me up in dirt
You can throw me like a line-man
I like it better when it hurts

Oh, I have waited here for you
I have waited

You make me wanna lala in the kitchen, on the floor
I'll be a french maid when I meet you at the door
I'm like an alley cat, drink the milk up, I want more
You make me wanna, you make me wanna scream

You can meet me on an aero-plane
Or in the back of the bus
You can throw me like a boomerang
I'll come back and beat you up
