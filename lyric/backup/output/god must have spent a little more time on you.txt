Can this be true? Tell me can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete, I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?

I never thought that love could feel like this
Then you changed my world with just one kiss
And how can it be, that been right here with me
There's an Angel, it's a miracle

Your love is like a river peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret, that I never could keep
