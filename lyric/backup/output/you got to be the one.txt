[CHORUS]
You got to be the one
You got to be the one
You got to be the one
You got to be the one

I got the stars, the moon and sun
All rolled up in one
I'm not one who talks a lot
Always brags about what he's got

Woman, you make me feel like a king
And I say, it's a wonderful thing
You got me hung up in
This love thing, yeah

[Repeat CHORUS]

And though I've been in love before
Never thought I wanted any more
You place at my command
