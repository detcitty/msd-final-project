It's rainin' again, what time is it?
Man, I can't believe he done stood me up again
I don't deserve this, what kind of fool does he think I am?
Time after time and today, but what for?
Huh, you know what? I think it's time I've looked for Mr. Do Right
Worked all day long, I need a man whose back is real strong
Someone to fulfill my intellect and sexual desires
Now, please don't get me wrong, I don't even come on strong
It's been awhile since I've been satisfied
And these feelings I can no longer hide
