He's got the best of me.
It's such a price to pay.
He's got the best of me.

See, I have been thinking it over.
It's all just a little too much.
You see I have got a four-leaf clover.
It's gotta bring a little luck.
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, uh huh

So I let go of all of the big deals.
I let go of the bitter dream.
You see the girl in the pretty white picture.
Well it's never what it really seems.
