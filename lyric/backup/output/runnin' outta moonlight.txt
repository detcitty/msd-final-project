Don't you worry bout gettin' fixed up
When you wake up your pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust
That's my head lights, that's my truck
Come on baby don't you keep me waiting
I gotta go I got a reservation,
Tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when your in my arms

Whoa
Girl Every now and then you get a night like this
Whoa
This is one that we don't wanna miss, no

Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now were knocking on midnight
