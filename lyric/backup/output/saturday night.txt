S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y night!
S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y night!
S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y night!
S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y night!

Gonna keep on dancin' to the rock and roll
On Saturday night, Saturday night
Dancin' to the rhythm in our heart and soul
On Saturday night, Saturday night

I-I-I-I just can't wait
I-I-I-I gotta date

At the good ol' rock and roll
Folk show, I've gotta go!
Saturday night, Saturday night
