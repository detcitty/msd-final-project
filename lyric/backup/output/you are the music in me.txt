Kelsi: Na na na na
Na na na na na, yeah
You are the music in me

You know the words "once upon a time"
Make you listen, there's a reason

Kelsi & Gabriella: When you dream there's a chance you'll find
A little laugher, or happy ever after

Gabriella & Troy: You're a harmony to the melody
That's echoing inside my head
Gabriella: A single voice
Troy: Single voice
Gabriella: Above the noise
Both: And like a common thread
Troy: Hmm, you're pulling me

Gabriella: When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong
Troy: Oh, you are the music in me
Yeah, it's living in all of us
Gabriella: And it's brought us here because
Both: Because you are the music in me
