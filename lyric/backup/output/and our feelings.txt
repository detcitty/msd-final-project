We fell in love and who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
Now they wonder why we didn't last

We fell in love, it seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder love came to an end

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know, who don't know
