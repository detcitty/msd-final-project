My stage fright holds back me all night
Stage fright

My stage fright holds back me all night
Stage fright, it's down right mind boggling
My stage fright

Ten thousand eyes stare down upon me
Five thousand handsome viewers
Make me feel a tingle in my spine
The light are bright and so adorning
They hypnotize and make me realize
That things'll work out just fine
