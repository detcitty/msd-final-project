Oh Lord, you know that I'm not one to bother you with little thi-ings
And you and I have never been too-oo close
But we've always been on speakin' terms
I've watched you with doin' things
And tried to understand you more than most

No I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought you knew in my own way I worshipped you
While even your own children doubt and fail to understand
