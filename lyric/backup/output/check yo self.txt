You betta check yo self
For you wreck yo self
'Cause I'm bad for your health

I come real stealth
Droppin' bombs on ya moms
Fuck car alarms
Do without one mother nigga wit yo alpine

Sold it for six-o, always let tricks know
And friends know, we got that indoe
Yo, I'm not a sucka sittin' in a house of pain
And no I'm not the butler, i'll cut ya head-butt ya
You say you can't touch this

And I wouldn't touch ya, punk motherfucker
Here to let you know boy, oh boy
I make dough, but don't call me dough-boy
This ain't no fuckin' motion picture

A guy or bitch-a, my nigga get wit ya
And hit ya, makin' they yack to the neck
So you better run a check
So come on and chick-ity-check yo self
Before you wreck yo self
Chick-ity-check yo self

Before you wreck yo self
