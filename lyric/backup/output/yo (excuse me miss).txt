Whoa whoa
Do do do do do
Yeah
Yeah

Yo
Tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick, that a young'n ever seen before
I said "Yo."
Tell her girls I want to meet her (meet her)

On second thought that ain't the way to go
I got to give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I got to stop her
Or should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time

She's out the door, I got to go for mine
I think I'll say: "Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention, you're making me want to say yo
