Crazy
I go, I go, I go

Everything I do, I do it with a passion
If I gotta be a bitch, I'ma be a bad one
I'm AI with the designs, du-ragging
Bounce back game good, why we talkin' practice?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Pull up score when I want to
Best thing next to Heaven
They be tryna count me out though
I'm just countin', countin' blessings
A real woman 'bout her paper
Niggas don't know where I came from
Why I really really came up
