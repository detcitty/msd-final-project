Dis is, the point when I need everybody get to the dance floor
It's like that y'all
(That y'all)
That y'all
(That y'all)
Da da da da, I like that y'all
(That y'all)
That y'all
(That y'all)
That y'all
(That y'all)
Like da da da da, I like that y'all
(That y'all)
I came to have a party open up the bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale boy I know you watchin' me
So what's it gonna be?
Purple taking me higher I'm lifted and I like it
Boy, you got me inspired, baby come and get it
If you're really feelin' me
'Cuz it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin' it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just makin' the most of life
Everybody is livin it up
All the fellas keep lookin' at us
('Cuz)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all
(That y'all)
That y'all
(That y'all)
It's like da da da da, I like that y'all
(That y'all)
It's like that y'all
(That y'all)
That y'all
(That y'all)
