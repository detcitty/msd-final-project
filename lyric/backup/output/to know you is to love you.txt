To know you, is to love you,
but to know me, is not that way you see
'Cause you make me, so happy,
that my love for you grows intensely
When I'm down and feelin' sad,
you always comfort me
When I'm down and feelin' sad,
you always comfort me
Baby, to know you is to love you,
you smile when I see your face
