you don't have to love me (you don't have to love me)
You don't have to want me (anymore)
You don't have to need me (you don't have to need me)
Cuz i've got love on my side
And it's gonna be all right

Baby, I had a feeling that you were cheatin' on me
But blinded by love I couldn't see
I guess everybody plays the fool sometimes
But it's cool, yeah, it's cool
