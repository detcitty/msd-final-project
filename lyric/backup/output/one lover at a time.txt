Can't believe this mess I'm in
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Got my heart spread too thin
Lately the strain has been showing

I need a new direction
Don't wanna share my affection

One lover, one lover at a time
That's enough for me
One lover, one lover at a time
You're all I need

One lover
One lover
One lover
Hoo, hoo, hoo

My phone is ringing off the wall
Get confused which lover is calling
I can't take this anymore
