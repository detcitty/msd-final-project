Who's the worlds greatest?
Who's the worlds greatest?
The worlds greatest

I am a mountain
I am a tall tree, oh
I am a swift wind
Sweepin' the country
I am a river
Down in the valley, oh
I am a vision
And I can see clearly

If anybody ask you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my backs against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

I am a giant
I am an eagle, oh
I am a lion
Down in the jungle
I am a marchin' band
