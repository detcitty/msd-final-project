[Chorus:]
(Let me) let me, come inside
(I'll keep you) I'll keep you satisfied, tonight
If you want me, if you need me
(Let me) turn down all the lights
(I'll make you) I'll make you feel alright, tonight
Come inside, come inside

[Verse 1:]
I'm thinking about you
The last time we made love,
And I fantasize,
So many things that I dream of
I wanna do with you baby
And tonight won't be the same
I wanna come inside I like to hear you call my name
