It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness (Mmm)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Yeah)
Block that account, it's a catfish (Dubplate special)
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness (OVO, BBK)
Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish


You don't know me, you better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni (*shing*)
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie
On cloud 9, a man's extra cosy (greaze)
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
