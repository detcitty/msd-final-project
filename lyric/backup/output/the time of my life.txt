I've been waiting for my dreams
To turn into something
I could believe in
And looking for that
Magic rainbow
On the horizon
I couldn't see it
Until I let go
Gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm coming alive
Body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn

And I'll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time
This is the time to be
More than a name
