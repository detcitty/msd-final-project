False pretender, stop pretending
All gals single have dem singing, watch this

See, ain't no use pretending
You don't feel the way I do
With this message that your body's sending
Well, I can tell you want it too

Well, do you wanna hide the way you feel inside
It's too late to turn back now
Every little touch, it means so much
So, girl just let me show you how

Your body can't lie to me
'Cuz I know just what you're needing
Your body can't lie to me
'Cuz you're in need of some sexual healing

Me have, me have, me have
Di remedy fi mi heart
Me have di remedy fi di brain
Me have agony fi di body
Fi make yuh choo-choo like a train

Remedy fi di heart
Me have di remedy fi di
Me have agony fi di body
Fi make yuh choo-choo like a train

Extreme a love
Dat yuh cannot complain
I'm di boiler man
