I got a call. A telephone call today.
Somebody's offering a job a thousand miles away,
And I want to take it, it's the opportunity of a life time,
But I need a second opinion, an opinion other than mine.

So I, I'm turning to you,
Because you always seem to know what to do.
When times like these arrive, I call,
