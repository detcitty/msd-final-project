You keep telling me, yeah
But I ain't seen it
And you keep telling me no
But I hope you don't mean it

You're giving me buts and maybes
Don't you know that
You're driving me crazy
Why can't you tell it like it is

[CHORUS]
You gotta let your yeah be yeah
And your no be no
You gotta let your yeah be yeah
And your no be no

Because I'm on my guard
I'm watching you from head to toe
