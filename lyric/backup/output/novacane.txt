I think I started something
I got what I wanted
did didn't I can't feel nothing
Superhuman, even when i'm fucking
Viagra popping, every single record
Auto-tuning, zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected
Computed emotion, uh huh

I blame it on a model broad with the hollywood smile
Oww, stripper booty and rack like wow
Brain like berkeley
Met her at Coachella, I went to see Jigga
She went to see z-trip
Perfect, I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever

She said she wanna be dentist really badly
She's in school paying, for tuition doing porn in the valley
At least she working

But girl i can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste
But can you taste, a little taste

Novacane
