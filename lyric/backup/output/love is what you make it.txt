Love is
Love is what you make it
You can't make or break it
So don't you run
Run and hide
I said love is
Love is what you make it
And if you make it with me
We'll make it all right
Hey hey hey

Lover
Don't you run for cover
Don't run to your mother
No reason to
Every time

I said love is
Love is what you make it
And if you make it with me
We'll make it all right
