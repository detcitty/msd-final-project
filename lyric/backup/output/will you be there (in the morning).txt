I'm lying beside you, just thinking about us
Too tired to go to sleep, I'm too much in love
I know I'm crazy but I can't close my eyes
I'm scared you won't be there in the morning when I rise

Will you be there?
Now who do you dream about are you alone in your sleep?
To who will you reach out?
Oh, let it be me

Now baby, you're my obsession, my addiction, my drug
Don't want to be without you when I wake up, oh no
