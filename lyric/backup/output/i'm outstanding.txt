I was born three-six-seventy-two on a Wednesday
Hail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte
That means I'm gifted from the get-go
Mom's you never let go
Mad thanks for raising me right, bro'
You gave me confidence to stop the nonsense
Didn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince
Times are hard, times are rough
Didn't have Toys R Us toys, but I had enough love
Plus the guidance from above
To go to the park, sweatin' push and shove
Maybe then for a dunk like you told me
Then there were a few times when Dad had to scold me
Prayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling
Didn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing
Remember when you asked me this one day
Who I wanna' be like, I said Dr. J
Then you said, "Good, now you gotta' go
"Take the damn ball and slam it through the hole."
