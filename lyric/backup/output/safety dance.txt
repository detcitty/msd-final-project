We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine.

I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they'll never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
We can dance (Come see! )

We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine.


I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they'll never find
