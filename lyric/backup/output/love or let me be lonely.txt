Oh, love or let me be lonely
Part time love I could find any day
So don't defy Mother Nature's ways
Make it the love, the love
That's here to stay

I could live without love
If I wanted to in this lonely room
But I don't want to
So I leave it up to you
To wash away my gloom

I could live without love
If I wanted to in this lonely room
But I don't want to
So I leave it up to you
To wash away my gloom, oh, yeah

(Love, love) or let me be lonely
(Love) you better love or let me be
