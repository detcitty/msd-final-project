I wanna try something, all night
I wanna try something, all night

Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something new, all night
I wanna try something

By the way you looking tonight
Only one thing comes to my mind
When the lights come on at 2
I'll still be moving with you
Boy you're looking at nobody
Just my body

Don't know your name, but I guess I really don't care
I probably should wait, but I wanna let you go there
I wanna try something new, all night
