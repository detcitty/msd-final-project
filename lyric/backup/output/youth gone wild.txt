Woah yeah...

Since I was born, they couldn't hold me down
Another misfit kid, another burned-out town
I never played by the rules and I never really cared
My nasty reputation takes me everywhere.

Well I look and see it's not only me
So many others, have stood where I stand
We are the young (hey!) so raise your hands!

They call us problem child
We spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile
(We are the youth gone wild!)
