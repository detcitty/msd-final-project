Sometimes I think what turned her on,
Was my old broke down boots.
She wanted her a real cowboy,
It was a phase she was goin' through.
Not one week after she moved in,
I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue.
Brought home a bottle of pink chablis,
Poured out my best home brew.
I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls,
As she packed her things to leave.
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me.
She changed direction, headed out west.
Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess.
