Lighting stog after stog, and choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
