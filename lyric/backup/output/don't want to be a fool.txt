Love, what have you done
oh wow
I was sure up til now that she was a friend
i stayed til the end
(Don't be a fool again)
i once believed that love was fair
but I don't anymore
she said i'm a bore
my heart hit the floor
(don't be a fool again)

Each time around I tell myself
it's the game of love
ignore the signs and risk it all
in the name of love
well i've decided i can't let nobody hurt me again
so I'll say it til the end
i just don't want to be a fool
