Mother told me always to follow the golden rule
And she said it's really a sin to be mean and cruel
So remember if you're untrue
Angels up in heaven are looking at you

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart
so be very careful not to make us part
You won't get to heaven if you break my heart
Oh no!
