I never saw the end in sight, fools are kinda blind
Thought everything was going all right, but I was running out of time
'Cause you have one foot out the door, I swear I didn't see
But if you'r really going away, heres some final words from me.

Chorus:
Baby write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down!

Take my words and read them everyday
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
