Wake up in the mornin?, get to livin? my life
Makin? sure that I? m all that I can be
Went to church on Sunday, there was a moment that came
I swear it was like the Lord spoke right to me

So now I'm slowin? it down and I'm lookin? around
And I'm lovin' this town and I'm doin? alright
Aint' worried 'bout nothin? except for the man I wanna be
I'm thinkin? maybe it's time to be livin' a rhyme
