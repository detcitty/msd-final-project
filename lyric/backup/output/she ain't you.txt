She ain't, ain't
She ain't, ain't, no
She ain't, ain't
She ain't, ain't, no
She ain't, ain't
She ain't, ain't, no

She ain't, ain't
She ain't, ain't, no

You make it hard for me to see somebody else

I'm calling her your name yes messed up
Cause I'm thinking about you
So' for babe, I never wanted us to break up
No not this way
But you don't understand it girl
When she touches me
I'm wishing that they were your hands

And when I'm with her it's only about the sex
With you I had a bad romance

And if I could just trade her in I would
Cause nobody can pass you up no
