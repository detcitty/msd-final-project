I can still recall when we said that out love was forever
All those plans we made for tomorrow looked so bright
And I understand all the reasons you gave me for leavin'
But that doesn't help when I'm sleepin' alone each night

So if you ever have a change of heart
Just remember it's not too late to start
If you still believe in what love can do
