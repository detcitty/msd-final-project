Ahh...
In this life I've seen everything I can see woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
I've seen pigs all sittin' watching picture slides
But I never seen nothing like you

Do ya do ya want my life (woman)
Do ya do ya want my love (I'm saying)
Do ya do ya want my face (I need it)
Do ya do ya want my mind
