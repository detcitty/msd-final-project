Over by the window
There's a pack of cigarettes
Not my brand, you understand
Sometimes the girl forgets

She forgets to hide them
I know who left those smokes behind
She'll say, "Oh he's just a friend"
And I'll say, "Oh, I'm not blind to

Him, him, him
What's she gonna do about him
She's gonna have to do without him
Or do without me, me, me
