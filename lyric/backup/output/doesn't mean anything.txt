Used to dream bout being a millionaire, without a care
But if I'm seeing my dreams and you aren't there
Cause it's over, that just won't be fair, darling
Rather be a poor woman living on the street, no food to eat
Cause I don't want nobody if I have it cry
Cause it's over when you say goodbye

All at once, I had it all
