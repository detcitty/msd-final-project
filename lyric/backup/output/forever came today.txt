Ever, forever, ever and ever and ever
Ever, forever, ever and ever and ever

There you are, standing there
Reaching out for me
Something warm in your eyes
Touched my heart
And all the love I never knew, I found in you

Suddenly, my world, my life was standing still
And you touched my hand
I knew that we had laid a plan
For everlasting love, I've been forever dreaming of

At last, at last, my forever came today
When you walked into my life
Made my lonely life a paradise
It came today, forever came today

Ooh, look in my eyes and see how much I want ya
Feel my touch, you know how much I need ya
I may be young, but I'm old enough to know
Look at me, I will never let it go

Let this moment thrill me a lifetime
Make it last, make it last
Make it last forever
