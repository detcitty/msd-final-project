I'm crazy for you Mr. DJ
I just wanna get to know your name

I can remember
the very first time that I saw you
We were at a club music bangin
I gotta know your game and all about you that's all

Every night, every day, every time I hear you play
Can't get you off my mind
Every night, every day, I just wanna see your face
Get you off my mind

I'm crazy for you Mr. DJ
