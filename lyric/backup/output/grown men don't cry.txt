I pulled into the shopping center
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions runnin' down her face
All mornin' I'd been thinkin' my life's so hard
And they wore everything they own, livin' in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
