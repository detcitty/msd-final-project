In the empire of the senses
You're the queen of all you survey
All the cities, all the nation
Everything that falls your way, I say
There is a deeper world than this that you don't understand
There is a deeper world than this, tugging at your hand
Every ripple on the ocean
Every leaf on every tree
Every sand dune in the desert
Every power we never see
There is a deeper wave than this, swelling in the world
There is a deeper wave than this, listen to me girl
