So, she says it's time she goes
But wanted to be sure I know
She hopes we can be friends

I think, yeah, I guess we can say I
But didn't think to ask her why
She blocked her eyes and drew the curtains
With knots I've got yet to untie

What if I were Romeo in black jeans
What if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth
