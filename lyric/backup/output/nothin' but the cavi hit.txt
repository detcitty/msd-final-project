Blaze up
Oh yeah
World wide, west side
Yo
Mack Ten with Tha Dogg Pound
Yeah, and the hits don't stop Sucka
Nothin' but the cavi
Hey, Daz - Sup
Check this out, dog
Now when I come to ya'll hood, ya'll watch my back
And when ya come to Inglewood I'm a front you a sack
So we can grind and get away with the cash like a caper
Cause it ain't about the set-trip, it's all about the paper
Made the poverty cease, on the rise like yeast
A parvay lex piece, and I keep my khaki's creased
Mack Ten is the lick, and ya know what my set be
Connect gang from the west, nigga, where the best be
It ain't no questions asked
You down to blast for me?
Down to ride for me?
Down to die for me?
I come through for these sucka-ass niggas who rep
Come creepin' up on shorty slowly, show him death
Pull out the Mack ninety automatic for static
Blast a coupla niggas, leave em all panicked
We swerve and hit the curb, smoke some herb
We came up too much, and too tough, and too grub
We in the war zone
Where the war's on
Where ya gun, nigga?
Show em where you're from, nigga
Ridin'-ass young nigga
