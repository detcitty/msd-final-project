Nothing you could say could
Tear me away from my guy
Nothing you could do cause
I'm stuck like glue to my guy

I'm sticking to my guy
Like a stamp to a letter
Like birds of a feather
We just stick together

And I'll tell you from the start
I can't be torn apart from my guy

Nothing you can do could
Make me untrue to my guy
