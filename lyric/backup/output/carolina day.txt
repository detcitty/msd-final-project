*Carolina Day gonna rise up sometime 
Give me good align said a reason and rhyme 
Jump and sing all the time 
Work at a' easing my mind 

Oh, it's a Carolina day 
On a plane out of Logan, up pops a slogan 
Talkin' only of easy times 
Working at a bottle of ripple wine 
Breathing that clean fine southern air 
And we all start to laugh 
And the people start to stare thinking
