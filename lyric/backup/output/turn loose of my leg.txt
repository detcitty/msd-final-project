These girls today they sure act funny
Take you out and spend their money
But they always seem to expect a favor or two
A girl picked me up about a week ago
Drug me out to some drive-in show
Oh, I can't begin to say what she put me through
She parked me on the very last row
Reached down and grabbed my knee
My whole life flashed before my eyes
I said this can't be happining to me.

Chorus
