(chorus)

It aint none of your friends business
It aint none of your friends business
What we will be doin tonight
We can just hang out all night or grab a bite
It aint none of your friends business
It aint none of your friends business
Whether you get sexed tonight
Long as we protect ourselves and do it right
It aint none of your friends business
It aint none of your friends business
We can just go to the park
And lay there till after dark
At the park
It aint none of your friends business
It aint none of your friends business
