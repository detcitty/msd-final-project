He used to be a shy boy
Until I made him my boy
I never missed a heartbeat
Just sitting in the back seat

I'm gonna give him all my love
Each and every night
One thing I know he's dreaming of
I wanna squeeze and hold him tight

But don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop aaahh)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop aaahh)
Don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop aaahh)
And don't it make you feel good
(Shoop shoop aaahh)
