If I lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall
If I walked around at all, it was in bits and pieces of a jagged heart
You kissed me and every piece went back in place
Every pain got erased, you held me up to the sun light, now it feels like

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
And I never got lost, spent years in the dark
You're here, now my heart's unbroken

When I see your smile
Fill my soul again and I'm unbroken

If I doubted the power of love, baby, now I understand
