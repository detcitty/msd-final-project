Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby

Honey, welcome back home
I know she told you, honey I know she told you that she loved you
Much more than I did but all I know is that she left you
And you swear that you just don't know why
But you know, honey I'll always, I'll always be around if you ever want me

Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
