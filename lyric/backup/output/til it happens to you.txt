You tell me: "It gets better, it gets better in time"
You say I'll pull myself together, pull it together
"You'll be fine"

Tell me, what the hell do you know?
What do you know?
Tell me, how the hell could you know?
How could you know?

Til it happens to you, you don't know how it feels
How it feels
Til it happens to you, you won't know
It won't be real
