Yeah, I'm right here dog
Where my dogs at?
We right here dog
Where my dogs at?
I'm right here dog

What must I go through to show you shit is real?
And I ain't really never gave a fuck how niggaz feel
Rob then I steal, not 'cause I want to, 'cause I have to
Well don't make me show you with the Magnum
If you don't know by now then you slippin'
I'm on some bullshit thats got me jackin', niggaz flippin'
I got my man and them stay pretty like I'ma stay shitty
Crimey, it's all for the money, is you wit me?

Hit the bitches, went out I could make the crime
And when it's on we transform like optimus prime
I'll form the head, roll out, let's make it happen
If we ain't gonna get it wit them, we'll take the cap down
Bust it off, gust it off on the softest niggaz
Money with the biggest mouth, yo let's off this nigga
A novice nigga, never made a sound
Breath too fuckin' hard like you gettin' bust down

Ya niggaz wanna be killers?
Get at me dog
Ya niggaz wanna feel us?
Get at me dog
Ya niggaz want the bread?
Get at me dog
