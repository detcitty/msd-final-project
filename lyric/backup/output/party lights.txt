I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Make me feel all right

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Really out of sight

I see reflections going in the air
Telling me the way to move
I feel the spirit and it's everywhere
Telling me it's time to groove

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Make me feel all right
Mm, yeah

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Really out of sight

I must get out
I'm going crazy here
The time has come for me to say

Goodbye to all the
Things I used to fear
So long to lonely yesterday

I see the party lights
Shining in the night
Make me feel all right

Oh, I see the party lights
