That's how I do it baby
Don't stop, body jerkers remix
Verse One: Raekwon the Chef
Yo... Son, yo check it
Stay ladylike, get yours, fly perm, silk drawers
Les Paulie, ice your finger like Rollie
Collect em, weapon, plus we side-bettin, never wettin
Me and you, glowin like flourescent
Now, Asiatic, laces burned with a rabbit
Stab it, maintain mine, she gotta have it
Knowin you catchin me in lies
Snatchin me out of fives boo, yo you the shake, I'm the fries
Chill, daughter, you're Navy Seal real recorder
Peace, Law and Order, God-body hit it underwater
Relax, HBO yo, color Kangol
You're sweet mango, no champagne tango
Keep my Sky Pager blazin, so amazin
Rubbin my waves and your rock is the size of a raisin
Gettin it, youse a Queen Sarafina, Gina
Hittin it, doin ninety witcha man's Nina
Chorus: Gina Thompson
The things you do (every lit-tle thing)
Makes me keep running to you (ohwwhhhhhh)
The things you do (every lit-tle thing)
