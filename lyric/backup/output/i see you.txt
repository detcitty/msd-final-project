Roll in the bar, me and my crew
Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookin' me up, yeah
Buyin' me drinks with a thousand girls
There's just one thing

I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't give me a chance, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin' up there with the band
Takin' me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
