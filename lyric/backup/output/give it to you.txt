You say it's been too long (that's right)
Since you, had some
You say I turn you on (on)
Light the fire, that's burning inside
You think that I'm the one
(You see in your dreams)
I know what you mean, yeah

(you know what I'm sayin')

It's creepin' around in your head
Me holdin' you down in my bed
You don't have to say a word
I'm convinced, you want this

Baby, you know I can give it to you
