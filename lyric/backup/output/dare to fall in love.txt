One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

It's the question of the hour
How can I be sure
Of what I don't know
She comes to me with
A poison in her flower
She steals the miracle of life
Right out of my hand

And she takes the
Part of a woman
Most hard to comprehend
And she multiplies by ten
