Look'a here... (Umm-hmm...)
This how we gon' do this...
up the turntables,
Wolfe, get on the keyboard...
And we gon' run it, ya heard...

Cash Money.
Cash Money.
Cash Money.
Cash Money.

Now let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins,
Hit the mall with my girlfriends, dish out ends.
Cause you know it ain't trickin' if you got it,
Cop baby girl what she desire, it's chump change mama.
Marijuana Scholar... Knowin' what I got up in my styrofoam cup?
That purple stuff. It was givin' to me at birth to stunt.
So that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the fur in the guts.

(Ay, Ay, Ay.)
Hold on, mami! Them whips on dubs.
Cadillac truck, twenty-eights, no rubs.
Slide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eye lens,
Car show in New York, Ya'll know who wins!
It's the birdman, daddy, with the Gucci and Prada,
Slant-back, cut truck. No rims? Can't holla.
It's that Louie/Fendi on Ostrich streets,
It's the tailer-made daddy, Mami, do you love me?

Baby, I'ma a stunna. (Oh! Oh! Oh!)
I ain't gon' change it. (I told ya'll...)
