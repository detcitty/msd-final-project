I'ma show you how to get your shine on
(Shine on)
Turn it up the DJ playing my song
(My song)
Everybody keep on calling my phone
(My phone)
Which one of y'all am I gone take home
(Take home)

I'ma show 'em how to get the club crunk
(Club crunk)
Give 'em something thats goin' rattle that trunk
(That trunk)
Tip ya cups up until ya get drunk
(Get drunk)
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up

Give me that million dollar beat
And let me show you what to do with it
(Who that is?)
That's the illest rapper choppin' and screwin' it
Couldn't snatch the game
That's what they told me, so I'm provin' it

Put the truth in Texas with Scott Storch and you got you a hit
Hittin' never miss rep yo click and throw 'em high
Because Chamillionaire's the answer to the game like Allen I
Middle fingaz to the sky, if they don't like that reply
'Cause any DJ that deny is a mother fu err wee lie
So give the ladies what that want

Got 'em racin' to the front of the stage
To feel the bass and tell the DJ turn it up
(Turn it up)
Yeah, Sound of Revenge saying Universal to go get my plaque
Rappin's dead so I'ma bring it back
Like DJ's do when they hear my track

Check out my track record, they'll say I'ma track wrecka
Hotter than a black pepper now that I am back nigga
(He's back)
You can't get mad if you feel that you and cap fit ya
Drop the biggest stat's ever so don't let that back hit ya
