All right
Couldn't stop moving when it first took hold
Was a warm spring night at the old town hall
There was a group called 'The Jokers', they were layin' it down
Don't you know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound?
Rock and roll, hoochie koo
(Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse
(Light my fuse)
Rock and roll, hoochie koo
(Rock and roll, hoochie koo)
Drop on out, spread the news
