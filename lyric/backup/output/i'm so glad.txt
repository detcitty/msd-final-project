I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me
I'm so glad I found you, boy
I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me
I'm so glad I found you, boy

I can't wait to hold you tight
On all those sunny days
Lying on the beach at night
Makin' love in so many ways

I'm so glad I found someone like you to love me
