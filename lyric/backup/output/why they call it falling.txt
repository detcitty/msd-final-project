It's like jumpin', it's like leapin'
It's like walking on the ceiling
It's like floating, it's like flying through the air
It's like soaring, it's like gliding
It's a rocket ship you're riding
It's a feeling that can take you anywhere

Chorus - So why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
Why they call it falling
