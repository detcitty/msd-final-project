Ay yo, the flyest muthafucka up in the room
Yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hating on him

'Cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house
On the couch watching cartoons

You know how much you love it
When you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget
When you always be the subject of discussion

But it's nothing when you stop
And just say, fuck it
'Cause you walking out in public
And hear 'em talking rubbish

I just wanna ride
Ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch
Somewhere get my nuts kissed

That's the way it goes
When you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick
That used to brush me off in high school

Take over the world
When I'm on my Donald Trump shit
