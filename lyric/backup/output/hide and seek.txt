Don't need a lover
Who's a mystery
I want somebody
Who can talk to me
Don't need someone just
Putting on a show
You started something
Baby don't let go

Don't make me wait
Too long for your reply (Don't make me wait too long)
You ought to know that
You don't have to hide
Tell me you're ready boy
Look in my eyes

Chorus:
Baby put your love on me
Just open up, don't play Hide and Seek
