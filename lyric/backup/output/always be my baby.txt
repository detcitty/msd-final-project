We were as one, babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'm letting you fly

'Cause I know in my heart babe

Our love will never die
No
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
(Ohhh)

Time can't erase a feeling this strong
(No no no no)

No way you're never gonna shake me
