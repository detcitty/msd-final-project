Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue ridge mountain, Shenandoah river
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Blowing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia,
Mountain mama
Take me home,
Country roads

If I should stay
All my memories, they gather round her
I would only be in your way
A miner's lady, stranger to blue water
So I'll go, but I know
