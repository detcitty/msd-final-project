[Intro]
Oh yeah muthafucka
that's that shit
oh, com on, yea
ladies make it hot, thugs make it hot, make it pop.
[1st Chorus]
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang (Bravehearts)
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
oo-chie wally wally

[2nd Chorus]
He really really really work my body
He really really really turned me on
He really really really got to gut me
He really really made me scream and shout

[3rd Chorus]
He really taught me how to work my body
He really taught me how to go down south
He really really tried to hurt me hurt me
I really love to suck it gangsta style

[Verse One]
Yo we got chicks in the living room gettin it on
and they ain't leaving till six in the morning
O is for oochie
Oh you ain't know how many O's in the bank roll
sorta like the game show
Who wants to be a millionaire
but my name ain't Regis
Nas, the one they call when they want their thing beat up.
Honeys for bodies,
two bravehearts, guns in the parties
waves, braves, bald trade marks to army
Is that horse it must be, I heard he husky,
yea there goes jungle
eyes red looking for trouble
