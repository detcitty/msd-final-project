In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart-shaped locket
Starin' at a family, flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight

Mom and daddy just won't stop it
Fightin' at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls, catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire

Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talkin' through the tears
And she's sayin', and she's prayin'

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurting no one
Just a bang, bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
