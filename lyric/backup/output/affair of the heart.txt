Heart in my mouth
Pulse in my head
Mercury rising into the red
The smell of your skin can
Light up all the fires in me

Hungry to touch
I'm eager to please
Out of control
And I hand you the keys
Every night I am burning
To make love to you

But don't try to tell me
you think it's all physical
It goes much deeper than that

You ought to know
It's an affair of the heart
