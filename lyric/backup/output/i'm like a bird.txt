You're beautiful, and that's for sure
You'll never, ever fade
You're lovely, but it's not for sure
That I won't ever change
And though my love is rare...
Though my love is true...

I'm like a bird, I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (soul is)
I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

Your faith in me brings me to tears
Even after all these years
And it pains me so much to tell
