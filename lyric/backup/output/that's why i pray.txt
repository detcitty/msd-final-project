Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Man on the TV's gone insane
Everybody's just laughing
People across the world holding on
The earth caved in, the ocean came down crashing

My neighbor lost his house
'Cause he can't find a job
Don't you dare pledge allegiance
Don't you dare speak of God
Speak of God, oh, oh, oh, oh

Now I'm begging for forgiveness
