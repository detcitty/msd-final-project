Come to my window
Crawl inside
Wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon

I would dial the numbers
Just to listen to your breath
And I would stand inside my hell
And hold the hand of death
You don't know how far I'd go
To ease this precious ache
And you don't know how much I'd give
Or how much I can take

Just to reach you
Just to reach you
Oh... to reach you
Oh...

Come to my window
