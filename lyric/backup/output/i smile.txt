I dedicate this song to recession,
depression and unemployment.
This song's for you.

Today's a new day, and there is no sunshine.
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
and it feels like a cold night.
Today's a new day, where are my blue skies,
where is the love and the joy that you promised me
you tell me it's alright.

I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain,
fell from heaven like a shower.
(When I think how much better I'm gonna be when this is over)

I smile, even though I'm hurt see I smile,
I know God is working so I smile,
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile, smile.
it's so hard to look up when you look down.
I sure would hate to see you give up now
You look so much better when you smile, so smile.
Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine.
