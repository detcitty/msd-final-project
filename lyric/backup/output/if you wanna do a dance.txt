(If you wanna do a dance all night, all night)
(If you wanna do a dance all night, all night)

(If you wanna do a dance all night, all night)
(If you wanna do a dance all night, all night)

Oh yeah, 
Why don't ya sing a song?
Baby, it feels good to me.
I wonder, 
Does it feel good to you, now?

Hey, hey! 
Everybody, everywhere, 
Listen to us now.
Feel the music,
