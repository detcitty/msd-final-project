Baby, tell me
Are you serious
Hey, boy, you got me
So delirious

Why don't you
Stop playing games
Ooh, boy, do you think
You'll ever change

Baby, I don't know what I
Should do, no, about you
You sure make me feel
Like loving you, huh
You sure do, come on, baby

(Are you serious)

So tell me, your heart
Belongs to someone else
Baby, I just can't
Be killing myself

No, no, you got me
Going round and round
Honey, I can't seem
To settle down
