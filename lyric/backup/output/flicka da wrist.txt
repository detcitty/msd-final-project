Look at the flicka da wrist

Catchin' plays, catchin' play
I woke up feelin' like I was on the moon
I woke up feelin' like I need a hundred goons
Look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist

I woke up feelin' like I was on the moon
I woke up feelin' like I need a hundred goons
Some niggas in my sleep tried to capture me
Some bitches in my section tryna fuck for free
