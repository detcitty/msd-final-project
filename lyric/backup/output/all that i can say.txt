Hmmm
Loving you is wonderful
Something like a miracle
Rest assured I feel the same way you do
Meeting you isn't hard
With you I can let down my guard
Stay secure that's all I'm asking from you
(Stay secure)

I wish I had words to tell (I wish)
This feeling that I know so well
But I don't, I don't

All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)

All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
