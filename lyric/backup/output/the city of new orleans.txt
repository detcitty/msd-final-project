Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
15 cars and 15 restless riders
3 conductors, 25 sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses, farms, and fields
Passing trains that have no name
And freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Good morning, America, how are you?
