You never give yourself completely
It's just that you've been hurt before
You're so afraid to let me love you
You never leave an open door

Don't judge me by some other lover
Who broke your heart and walked away
Come let's be fair with one another
My world is yours, I swear it
Say the word and we can share it

Don't hide your love
 (Don't hide your love)
Not if you care for me
