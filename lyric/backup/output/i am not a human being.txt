I am not a human being

Pussy for lunch, pop all the balloons and spit in the punch
Yeah, kush in the blunts
I ride through your block see a foot in the trunk
I don't know why they keep playing, they better re-plan
I'm giving 'em the blues, Bobby Blue Bland
Together we stand and fall on y'all
Balling with my Bloods, call it b-ball
These days ain't shit, Young Money is
I got Mars bars, 3 Musketeers
Come through, coupe same color as veneers
And you know I'm riding with the toast, cheers!
Now I'm back on my grizz
And y'all's a bunch a squares like a mothafuckin' grid
Shit, fuck with me and get hit
I finger-fuck the Nina, make the bitch have kids
Just do it? My nigga, I just did
Name a mothafucka deeper than me, bitch dead
You dig? This here is big biz

And I scream fuck it's whoever it is
