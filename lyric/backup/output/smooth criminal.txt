As he came into the window
Was the sound of a Crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie are you OK?

Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
(Annie, are you OK?)

(Will you tell us that you're OK?)

(There's a sign in the window)
(That he struck you a Crescendo, Annie)
(He came into your apartment)
(He left the bloodstains on the carpet)
(Then you ran into the bedroom)
(You were struck down)
(It was your doom.)

Annie, are you OK?
