I heard about her from a friend of mine
He said she lives across the county line
The sweetest pick that ever grew on the vine
And now that's where I'm spending all my time

Her daddy Robert and her mama Ruth
They had a daughter name of Bobbie Sue
And now she's eighteen and she knows the truth
Nobody's gonna tell her what to do

Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Bobbie Sue
