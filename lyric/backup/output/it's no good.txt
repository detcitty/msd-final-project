I'm gonna take my time
I have all the time in the world
To make you mine
It is written in the stars above

The gods decree
You'll be right here by my side
Right next to me
You can run but you cannot hide

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Don't say you love me
It's understood

Don't say you're happy
Out there without me
