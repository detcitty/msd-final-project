Sitting on the doorstep of the house I can't afford
I can feel you there
Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard
To love you even though you nearly lost my heart
How can I explain the meaning of our love?
It fits so tight, closer than a glove

Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
