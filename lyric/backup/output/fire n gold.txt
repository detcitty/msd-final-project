Like an astronaut that's scared of heights
With a heart that's beating at the speed of light
You've been waiting for this feeling all your life

Sometimes it's just hard to realize
When you're stuck in a moment
And your spark has been stolen
This is our time to own it
So own it

Baby we were born with
Fire n gold in our eyes, eyes
With fire n gold in our eyes, eyes
