Maxine was five foot nine, had a man she didn't mind
Walked up to me nice and slow, what she wanted I did not know
Gave me her pager number and said call her anytime
Then she whispered in my ear, she said

"My body wants you so for what I miss at home
Nobody has to know, keep it on the down low
My body wants you so for what I miss at home
Nobody has to know, keep it on the down low
Keep it on the down low, ohh hoo, keep it on the down low"
