Yeah, it's Gucci, what's up, baby?
Yellow everything this time, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Yellow rims, yellow big-booty, yellow bones

Yellow rounds, yellow MP's
Yellow watch, yellow charm ring chain
Yellow livin' room set, lemonade Gucci shoes for my girl
It's Gucci, it's Gucci

My Phantom sittin' on sixes, no 20's in my denim
Your cutlass motor knockin' because it is a lemon
I like them Georgia peaches but you look more like a lemon
These sour apple bitter bitches, I'm not fuckin' with 'em

I'm truly stupid paid that's just how I feel today
I'm movin' slow 'cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade
I'm standing in the shade and I'm sellin' lemonade
$600 a pint the going rate off in the A (Lemon!)

Lemonade diamond bracelet put it in your face
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday
I'm pimpin' where I'm winnin', that's just how I'm chillin'
I'm smokin' grits and sellin' chickens, Corvette painted lemon

It's Gucci
