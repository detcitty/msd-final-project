The moon is full, my arms are empty
All night long I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July

Your bags are packed, not a word is spoken
guess we said everything with good-bye
Time moves so slow, promises get broken
On this cold day in July

Sun's comin' up, comin' up, down on Main Street
