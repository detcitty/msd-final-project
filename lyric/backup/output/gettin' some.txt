You know u niggas want a bitch like me
Apple bottoms with the wife beater, rockin' Nikes
All the niggas in the hood wanna call her wifey
If u got a pretty dolla then I prob'ly might be

U niggas poppin' collars while yo bitches pop p's
I'm gon' do it for my riders that get down and pop e
Think u can pop me, man u need to stop please
Catch me flyin' thru yo hood in a drop top v

I'm in the pop top three
And ma pops got G's
Say the watch got chilly
And the rocks got freeze
