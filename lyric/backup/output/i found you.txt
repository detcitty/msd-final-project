She wants me to come over
I can tell her eyes don't lie
She's calling me in the dark
She moves us around the room 
where the lights turn like the sky
Confidence like a rock star

I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
I'm moving to the beat of her heart
I was so lost until tonight, tonight

I found you, in the darkest hour
I found you, in a pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your love pulled me back again
Found you in a river of pure emotions
I found you, my only truth
I found you, with the music playing
