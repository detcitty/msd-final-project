That's why baby baby baby
that's why I've got to see you again
that's why baby baby baby
that's why I've got to see you again
Sometimes I get lost in my confusion
it's something that I need to talk about
old romance it's just a no-delusion
don't you know we could've worked this out
I see your face and not just 'cause I'm lonely
I can't erase the touch of your hand
it's you I need and you that I will only
I'm trying baby just as hard as I can
That's why baby baby baby
that's why I've got to see you again
