This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
Yes it's the final thing
When the nights is cold and lonely

Was it the money that made me a savage?
Poppin' them percs and I made it a habit
Totin' them pictures and serving them addicts
That was exciting to me
I'm so excited to be
Started with nothin' we had to inspire to be
Niggas ain't flyer than me
I'm getting to it
Feel like the man, I got the plan
I call the shooters, they hop out the van
Play with the squad, get popped like a Xan
Pop like a Perc, I'm goin' ham
I'm goin' crazy on niggas, too wavy for niggas
Do magic like alakazam
I'm in the kitchen compressin' a birdie
