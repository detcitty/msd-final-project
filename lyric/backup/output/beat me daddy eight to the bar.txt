With His Lost Planet Airmen

Well, there's a little
Honky tonky village in Texas
Where's a guy who plays
The best piano by far

He can play piano
Any way you like it
But the way he plays it best
Is eight to the bar

When he jams, it's a ball
He's the daddy of them all

The people gather round
When he gets on the stand
And when he plays
He gets a hand

The rhythm he plays
Puts the cats in a trance
