Na na
(I miss Mayberry)
Nanananana
Nananananana
Na na
Nanananana
Nananananana

Sometimes it feels like this world's spinning faster
Than it did in the old days
So naturally, we have more natural disasters
From the strain of a fast pace
Sunday was a day of rest
Now, it's one more day for progress
And we can't slow down
(And we can't slow down)
'Cause more is less
('Cause more is less)
It's all an endless process

I miss Mayberry
Sittin' on the porch drinkin' ice cold cherry coke
Where everything is black and white
(Nana nana nananananana)
