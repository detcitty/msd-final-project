Suitcase packed with all his things
Car pulls up, the doorbell rings
He don't wanna go
He thought he'd found his home

But with circumstances he can't change
Waves goodbye as they pull away
From the life he's known
For the last seven months or so

She said:

(CHORUS)
We found a man who looks like you
Who cried and said he never knew
About the boy in pictures that we showed him

A rambler in his younger days
He knew he made a few mistakes
But he swore he would have been there
