Sitting home

Sitting home waiting for you
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do
I try my best to be good to you
But you're never around when I'm in the mood

I'm getting tired of being tired of your ways
You haven't come home or even called today
And you don't know the pain when I'm feeling alone
I'm calling out your name when you're not even home

And I need you with me, babe, can't see you leaving me, babe
'Cause I don't know no other road I would go
And I hope your feelings change, come bring your loving back to me
So I can give you all you need and much more
I'm sitting
