There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above

Ooh, I lose control
Can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming

Tell me is it really love

How will I know?
(Don't trust your feelings)

How will I know?
How will I know?

(Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me
