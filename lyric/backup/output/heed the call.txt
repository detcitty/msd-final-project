Have you been listening
(Listen to the music)
Have you been sleeping
(The sermon's in the music)

(The man standing next to you)
(He must surely be your brother)

(So brother please)
Heed the call

(The piper he's still piping)
The magic in the music
(The drummer he's still drumming)
The message in the music
