Two broken hearts
Neither one knows what to say
Both falling from love
But not quite all the way

Look at us now
Reaching back for yesterday
Wanting to know
If the other wants to stay

After all, I'm the one
Who said we're through
Now I can't live
Without you anymore

And out there, lost
Is a dream that can come true
Is it worth the reaching for
Do you need me anymore, darling

Hold me til the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness
From your eyes

Hold me til the morning sun
Let me stay, we've just begun
I want to stay with you
