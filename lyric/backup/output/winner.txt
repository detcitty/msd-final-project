I'm wakin, up in the morning
Hustling to the stage and fuckin performin'
Bustlin' through the hate and bustin' the door in
Lately nothing misses I must've been scorin'
Speaking of the Misses I'm watchin' 'em pour in
Just like a drink that I'm enjoying
I don't mean bottles - you're welcome to join in
Just look at me soarin' - Feeling like Jordan
Oh-oh
Hold up I ain't finished yet
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I don't get cut, I make 'em cut the check
Can't hear me in the stands, let me say it again
Oh-oh
You ain't heard, I'm the shit
On the top, but you just don't get it yet
I never got cut, but I make 'em cut the check
So hate on, but guess what?
I feel like I can't miss
I know they want me to fall
But ain't nothin' bigger than this
So just pass me the ball
