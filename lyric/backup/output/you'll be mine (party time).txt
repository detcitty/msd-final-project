When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody know it's party time
And when the moon is rising high
I'll be yours, I know you will be mine (party time)

All day the world goes round & round
You can feel the changes coming down
It dosen't matter who you are
With love to give you will go far
We see the treasures all around
And burn ourselves into the ground
Everyone's trying to survive
