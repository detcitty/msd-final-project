Hold on
i'll be back for you
it won't be long
but for now there's something else
that's calling me
so take me down a lonesome road
point me east and let me go
that suitcase weighs me down
with memories
I just wanna be the one you run to
i just wanna be the one you come to
i just wanna be there for someone
when the night comes
let's put all the cares behind us
and go where they'll never find us
i just wanna be there beside you
when the night comes
when the night comes
Two spirits in the night
that can leave before the morning light
when there's nothing left to lose
and nothing left to fear
