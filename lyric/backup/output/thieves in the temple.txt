Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There's thieves in the temple tonight
They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
They're thieves in the temple tonight

Love, if you're there come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I should die if you're not there

Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
