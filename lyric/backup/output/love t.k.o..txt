Lookin' back over my years
I guessed, I've shedded some tears
Told myself time and time again
This time I'm gonna win

But another fight, things ain't right
I'm losin' again
Takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again

Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O. (Oh... oh... oh...)
Think I'd better let it go (What you think about it, girl), let it go, baby (Oh, yeah)
Looks like another love T.K.O. (Mmm... mmm... mmm)

Tried to take control of the love
Love took control of me
'Cause you lose all thoughts, sense of time
And have a change of mind
