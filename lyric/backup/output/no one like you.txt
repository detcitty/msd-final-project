Girl, it's been a long time that we've been apart
Much too long for a man who needs love
I miss you since I've been away
Babe, it wasn't easy to leave you alone
It's getting harder now that I'm gone
If I had the choice, I would stay

There's no one like you
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we do
