Having been by that old bank tower,
I'm inclined to wonder why you feel so strong.
You can't have really seen the hour
If you think she's trying to do you wrong.
I see you got that lump in your throat
I hear you mumbling, "That's all she wrote."
Love was in the next room drinking antidote.

You ought to know that girl by now.
