Hey, Ms. Red Carpet, she can autograph my pockets
Anytime, anyplace, anyway, I'll be looking at everybody else watchin'
I don't wanna be obnoxious, but this girl worth the gossip
Take it with a smile, the tattoos now, forever she very God-less

I imagine her topless, she might set off my rocket
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 on and poppin'
She mad marketed, attitude like we arguin'
She ain't no rock star but she got groupies

She ain't no actress but she make movies
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking they neck like
Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

She ain't got riches but she got fashion

She ain't a model, but cameras flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking they neck like
