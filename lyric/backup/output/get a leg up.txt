Don't look at me, don't touch me
Keep your mind straight ahead
Don't get no funny ideas about me
Or you'll wish that you were dead
That's what I'm thinking she must be thinking
The girl I spent 53 bucks on last night
She gives me a look from the corner of her eye
That says, "Boy, keep acting right."
How surprised was I
When she leaned over and whispered in my ear

Get a leg up
Get a leg over boy
Get a leg up
What's the matter
