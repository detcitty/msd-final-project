Somebody's gettin' it
Somebody's gettin' your love
Somebody's gettin' it
Somebody's gettin' your love

My eyes are open
I don't like what I see
Somebody's gettin' my action
Someone other than me

'Cause when I kiss you
It just ain't the same
You slipped the other night
And called me someone else's name

Somebody's gettin' it
Somebody's gettin' your love
Somebody's gettin' it
Somebody's gettin' your love

I thought I had you
In the palm of my hand
Tried to hide you from
All the other men

You knew I was tipping
With someone else
You gave me enough rope
