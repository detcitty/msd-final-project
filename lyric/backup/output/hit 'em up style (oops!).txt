While he was scheming
I was beamin' in the beamer just beamin'
can't believe that I caught my man cheating
so I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman-Marcus on a shopping spree-ah
And on the way I grabbed Soley and Mia
And as the cash box rang I
thought everything away (oops)

there goes the dreams we used to say (oops)
there goes the time we spented away (oops)
there goes the love we had
but you cheated on me and that's for that now (oops)
there goes the house we made a home (oops)
there goes you'll never leave me alone (oops)
for all the lies you told this is what you owe
Hey Ladies
when your man wanna get buck wild
just go back and hit 'em up style
put your hands on his cash and
spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
oh

when your cold and everything goes
from the crib, to the ride and the clothes
so you better let him know that
if you mess up
