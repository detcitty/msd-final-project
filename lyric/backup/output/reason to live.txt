Out of love, there's nobody around
All I hear is the sound of a broken heart
Out of time, no more waitin' for you
Now the hurtin's through and a new day starts

And I feel a change in my life
I sailed into dark and endless nights
And made it alive

Everybody's got a reason to live, baby
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside
