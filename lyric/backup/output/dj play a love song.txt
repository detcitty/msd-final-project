I know you see me lookin' at you
And I know he know you lookin' at me
Well, damn

DJ won't you play this girl a love song?
She really needs to hear this freakin' love song
She's lookin' at me kinda hard, I can tell that things
Ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me
To beat a beat, beat it, beat it

I can see how you want it, baby
Wish ya man wasn't here with ya, baby
I can see curiosity, gotcha wanna try me
Homeboy, can't please ya
On this wall, in the open baby
You wouldn't care if the crowd was watchin', baby
You want it, I know it
Gotta notion to pull your ass up outta here

DJ won't you play this girl a love song?
She really needs to hear this freakin' love song
She's lookin' at me kinda hard, I can tell that things
Ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me
To beat a beat, beat it, beat it
