Just gotta make it, alright, just gotta make it
Just gotta make it, alright, just gotta make it
Just gotta make it, alright, just gotta make it

Shawty, all I got is a dollar and a dream
Is ya gonna roll wit me?
You see I've tried a 9 to 5, and it just don't fit me, no
I can get us out the hood and have us livin' good

Ya feel me?
But I ain't leavin' here if you ain't wit me
'Cause a suit wit a smile that don't fit me
Taking a bus for some miles is gon' kill me

I'm tryin' to turn it around
Start this thing from the ground
And as long as you're down I know

Looking at you day after day, I know I
Just gotta make it, alright, just gotta make it
Just to see that smile upon your face I know I
Just gotta make it, alright, just gotta make it

Everything I do I do for you and we
Just gotta make it, alright, just gotta make it
To the top of the world me and my girl we
Just gotta make it, alright, just gotta make it

Now, baby, one day soon you gone walk outside
Just to see a Mercedes
