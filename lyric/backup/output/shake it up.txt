Uh well, dance all night play all day
Don't let nothin' get in the way
Dance all night keep the beat
Don't you worry 'bout two left feet
Shake it up
Shake it up, oo yeah
Shake it up
Shake it up

Well dance all night get real loose
You don't need no bad excuse
Dance all night with anyone
Don't let nobody pick your fun
Shake it up, oo-oo
Shake it up, yeah yeah
Shake it up, oo-oo
Shake it up

That's right I said dance all night
(Go go go)
And dance all night
(Get real low)
