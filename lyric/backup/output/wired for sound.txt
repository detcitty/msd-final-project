I like small speakers, I like tall speakers
If they've music they've wired for sound

Walkin' about with a head full of music
Cassette in my pocket and I'm gonna use it
Stereo out on the street you know, woh oh woh

Into the car go to work I'm cruisin'
I never think that I'll blow all my fuses
Traffic flows into the breakfast show, woh oh woh
