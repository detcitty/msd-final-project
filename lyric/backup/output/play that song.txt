Play that song
The one that makes me go all night long
The one that makes me think of you
That's all you gotta do

Hey mister DJ when you gonna spin it
My baby's favorite record
She been waiting for a minute
She invited all her friends
And I'm buying all the rounds
And they're all dolled up
DJ please don't let me down

When you gonna play that song, now
When you gonna earn that pay
When you gonna play that song
And make my day

She said

Play that song
The one that makes me go all night long
The one that makes me think of you
