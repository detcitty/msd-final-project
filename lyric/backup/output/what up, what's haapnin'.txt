Aye What's Happenin'
All you haters should get at me cause I hear ya and I'm watchin' but I'm serious haters so all I gotta say is...

[Chorus:]
What up, what's happenin'
All u haters can get at me (hey)
Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin' (hey)
But I'm still here I ain't stoppin'

So What up, what's happenin'
All u haters should get at me
Cause I hear ya and I'm watchin'
But I'm serious haters so all I gotta say is what up...

[Verse 1:]
What it is bruh (bruh)
What it do mane (mane)
I'm still tha man from the pan to tha blue flame
Then hit tha door make it rain with the loose change
I bet that what he did a show, now that's a damn shame
I guess that what he hatin for boy u so damn lame (Sucka Nigga)
Ya Click tha same, just a bunch of walkin shit stains
Disgrace to tha A ya give the city such a bad name
You way back in my rearview mirror I'm in tha fast lane
Still I hear ya loud and clear on ya lil' song
Go on getcha dissin' on while tha king on
His self esteem gone (why) cause I'm back now
Let's see if we can't teach these niggas how to act now
Kissin' ass then, jumpin' back now
I check ya ass then, I shut ya ass down
And I deliver front and center, never back down
Who get tha last laugh now sucka nigga

[Chorus:]
What up, what's happenin'
