Honey, I'll always love you
I promise I'll always love you
'Cause I think the whole world of you
And you can't change that, no, no

There's nothing you can do or say
I thought about this for many a day
And my mind's made up to feel this way
And you can't change that

'Cause you're the only one I love
And you can't change that
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that

You're the only one I love
And you can't change that
You're the only one I need
And you can't change that

Now you can try if you want to, woo

You can change your telephone number
And you can change your address too
But you can't stop me from loving you
