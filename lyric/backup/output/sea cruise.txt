Old man rhythm is in my shoes
It's no use sitting here
Singing the blues
So be my guest you got nothing to lose
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise

Oooooo Eeeeee Oooooo Eeeeee baby
Oooooo Eeeeee Oooooo Eeeeee baby
Oooooo Eeeeee Oooooo Eeeeee baby
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise

Feel like travelling
