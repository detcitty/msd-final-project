Jesus loves the little children
All the children of the world
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in his sight
Jesus loves the little children of the world

Everything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day
And everybody's beautiful in their own way
Under God's Heaven
The world's gonna find the way
