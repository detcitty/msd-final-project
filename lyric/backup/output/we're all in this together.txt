Together
Together
Together everyone.

Together
Together
Come on let's have some fun.

Together
We're there for each other every time
Together
Together
Come on let's do this right

Here and now it's time for celebration
I finally figured out, yeah, yeah
That all our dreams have no limitations
That's what it's all about（Come on now）
Everyone is special in their own way

We make each other strong
We make each other strong
We're not the same
We're different in a good way
Together's where we belong

We're all in this together, Once we know
That we are, We're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together, And it shows

When we stand, Hand in hand
