You and me we had a love that was forever
That's what I thought and I can still remember
Words you said, you said we'd always be together
Then why am I alone tonight?

Somethin' changed now you just don't feel the same
I'll never understand

How can the same love
That made me so happy, make me so sad?
I don't understand
