Do you really want it
Do you really want it
Do you really want it

Go, go, go (go, go, go)
Ale, ale, ale (ale, ale, ale)
Go (go), go (go)
Go (go), go (go)
Here we go (yeah)

The cup of life, this is the one
Now is the time, don't ever stop
Push it along, gotta be strong
Push it along, right to the top

The feeling in your soul is gonna take control
Nothing can hold you back if you really want it
I see it in your eyes, you want the cup of life
Now that the day is here, gotta go and get it
Do you really want it (yeah)
Do you really want it (yeah)

Here we go, ale, ale, ale
