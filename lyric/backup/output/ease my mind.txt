I need some time to ease my mind

Thrusted in a world that I don't know
from my mamas lips between my mamas hips
I'm cuddled by her hands because she understands
it's that bond that keeps the movement movin' on.
Life is surrounded with so many insecurities
back stabbin' is like breathing when in poverty.
I try to make my sanity, with the insane
God is secondary to most, when they scrap for money.
But, then again money can cause even more death.
when a African becomes a nigger step n fetch n all.
I dare say when price is right U can buy us all.
well not me, cuz I don't truly give a care about you.
I'll move in poverty, in wealth but I'll surely move!
