Children, behave
That's what they say when we're together
And watch how you play
They don't understand

And so we're running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hands
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me and we tumble to the ground

And then you say, "I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
