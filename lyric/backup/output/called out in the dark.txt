It's like we just can't help ourselves
Cause we don't know how to back down
We were called out to the streets
We were called out into the towns
How the heaven's they opened up
Like arms of dazzling gold
With our rain washed histories
When we're do not need to be told

Show me now
Show me the arms aloft
Every eye
