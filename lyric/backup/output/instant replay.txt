(Ten, nine, eight, seven
(Six, five, four, three, two, one)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

You set my lips on fire
You won the key to my heart
You've got a special way to move me
Don't stop now let's do it again

You keep me dancin' through the moonlight
I feel the pleasure in your touch
And everything you are is heaven
Oh, I can't get enough, no I can't get enough

(Instant replay)
I've got to have it
(Instant replay)
Ooh woh ooh-ooh
(Instant replay)
Got to have your love again
 (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

I feel so good about us
