Oh, mmm, I know a place
Ain't nobody cryin', ain't nobody worried
Ain't no smilin' faces, mmm, no no

Lyin' to the races, help me, come on, come on
Somebody, help me now
(I'll take you there)
Help me, y'all
(I'll take you there)
Help me now
(I'll take you there)
Oh

(I'll take you there)
Oh, oh, mercy
(I'll take you there)
Oh, let me take you there
(I'll take you there)
Oh, oh, let me take you there
(I'll take you there)

Play your, play your piano now
All right, ah, do it, do it, come on now
Play on it, play on it, make daddy now
Daddy daddy daddy, play your

Ooh, Lord, all right now
Baby, little lady, easy now
Now, come on, little lady, all right
Sock it, sock it, ah, oh, oh
I know a place, y'all
