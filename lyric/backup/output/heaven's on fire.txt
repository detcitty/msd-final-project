I look at you and my blood boils hot
I feel my temperature rise
I want it all, give me what you got
There's hunger in your eyes

I'm getting closer, baby hear me breathe
You know the way to give me what I need
Just let me love you and you'll never leave

Feel my heat takin' you higher
Burn with me, Heaven's on fire
Paint the sky with desire
