Somebody is gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody is gonna come undone
It's nothin' we can do

Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night

Everybody wants to take a little chance
Make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
Lord I know

Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
