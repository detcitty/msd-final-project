Got a girl from the Southside
Got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by
Man I â€˜Bout fell up out my chair

Had to get her number
Took me like 6 weeks
Now me and her go way back
Like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
