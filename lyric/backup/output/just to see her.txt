Just to see her ... just to touch her,
Just to hold her in my arms again one more time.
If I could feel her warm embrace ... see her smiling face,
Can't find anyone to take her place ... I've got to see her again.

Chorus:
I would do anything ... I would go anywhere,
There's nothin' I wouldn't do ... just to see her again.
