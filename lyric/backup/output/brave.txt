You can be amazing 
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug 
You can be the outcast 
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love 
Or you can start speaking up 
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do 
And they settle ‘neath your skin 
Kept on the inside and no sunlight 
Sometimes a shadow wins 
But I wonder what would happen if you 

Say what you wanna say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave 

With what you want to say 
And let the words fall out 
Honestly I wanna see you be brave 

I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you 
I just wanna see you
