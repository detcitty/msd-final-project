Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
You took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love

And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
