Drop it, drop it low girl, drop it, drop it low girl
Drop it, drop it low girl, drop it, drop it low girl

If ya ass too big I make ya back that ass up
I only go down if ya keep ya grass cut
Hair to the back, hat to the front
Weezy F Baby tatted on the butt
Okay
Still remixin' with one of these vixens
I make her ride me like I'm Sea Biscuit
Ms. Ester Dean you can get it
Look, I like a nice two pack and a booty on biggie
Whats really good? what you know about it
Swagger too good I should notarize it
Yeah they call me Tune, no bugs bunny
Make the booty clap, give it up for me
Yeah it's Young Money, you know I brung money
I make that booty talk Connie Chung for me
I got her butt naked in a red snuggie
I make her drop it low like she duckin' from me
Now where she at, where she at
There she go, there she go
She brang it back, bra-brang it back
