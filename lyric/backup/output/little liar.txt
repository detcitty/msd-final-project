(Joan Jett/Desmond Child)

I was taught to never tell a lie
To look you in the eye and tell it like it is
Always thought that you would be the same
It's such a shame that's not the way it is

I was fooled by your innocence
And my love for you was so intense
With our connection only physical
If it got me through the night
