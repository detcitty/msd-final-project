Bangkok, Oriental Setting
But the city don't know what the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner

Time flies – doesn't seem a minute
since the Tirolean spa had the chess boards in it
All changed, don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland, or the Philippines, or Hastings
Or … or this place!

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky, then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
