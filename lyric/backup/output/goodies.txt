My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
Not my goodies!

I got a sick reputation for handling broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more.
And in my rap
Tell valet to bring my 'lac
And I ain't coming back
So you can put a car right there.
I'm the truth
And ain't got nothin' to prove.
An you can ask anybody
'Cause they seen me do it.
Barricades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em.
Throw all the dirt you want it's no use.
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back pickin' out baskets of fruit.
(I love you boo)
Yeah freak and Petey love you too.
Ha ha
You know how I do

You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl.
Baby this is what I'm lookin' for. I want a
Sexy, independent, I ain't wit so you already know
