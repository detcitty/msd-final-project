Well let's burn until the sun burns your eye
& keep burnin' 'til it sets on the Westside
Just ride & stay high all night
Let's just ride & stay high all night

Devious:
It's late night where the sun rest
flick your Bics let's get lit man
I'm dressin' up this trick
Ms. Philly she got big plans
with a few bags of do bad
she the bomb when you hit it
'cause you glad to get blasted like Manson
knowin' Mr. Dutchmaster burn faster
but Big Daddy done turned into a bastard
so I'm no kin to Father Time when I'm smokin'
Who said trees couldn't grow dollar signs
no bought it by the lines
'til tomorrow shine coast to coast
blow the smoke go for broke
get yours split yours
& keep sippin' fifths 'til ya pis poor
& if ya can't handle this
still could hit the floor
It's strictly herb in the chest cavity
so we high to defy all the laws of gravity
rapidly when I come down like avalanches
I look the streets in search for free weed advances

Chorus
Well let's burn until the sun burns your eyes
& keep burnin' 'til it sets on the Westside
Just ride & stay high all night
