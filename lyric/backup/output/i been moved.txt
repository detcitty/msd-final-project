Seemed like forever
I been out in the cold
Tried my best to find true love
Nothing ever took hold

Then I met you, baby
Felt your sweet caress
I opened up my heart to you, honey
And I let you do the rest

I can tell it's true love
Honey, cause, I can feel it
Pounding in my heart, ooh

[CHORUS]
I been moved (moved)
I been moved (moved)
