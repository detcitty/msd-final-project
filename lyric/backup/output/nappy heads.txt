And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking

Round up de posse, fugee comin around the way

(wyclef) worrrrrd?

A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a libra y'all
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a libra y'all

Verse one: wyclef

You wanna battle swing I bring commanding men like I was king
In all your dreams I write the horror flick of stephen king
Cling to false also those papers say ock
I got tired of the fat lady so I sing to my own opera
Ba-lang-balang-balang-to-de-man-de-rock-cause I love thee
If you live by the sword you will be die by the gun
Cause all guys tell lies, and more girls commits it
I was ordered to code red, but now I'm chillin with a few good men
Assassination on the kid from the capitol
I never play the soap opera but now I'm a general hospital
Condition critical, spirit over who's the physical
So if I die, catch me at the funeral
I'll fly away, ohh glory
With a mic in my hand to a land where only God knows me
And the angels write raps on holy paper
I said I'm lookin for jesus, he said take the escalator
One flight up, is guaranteed you'll be there
My sister'd be there, my mother'd be there
So, mona lisa, could I get a date on friday?
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking
Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
