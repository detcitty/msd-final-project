I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
I'm gon' remember you, you gon' remember me
I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
I'm gon' remember you, you gon' remember me
I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind I can't help but question
Does she rub your feet when you've had a long day?
Scratch your scalp when you take out your braids?
Does she know that you like to play PS2
Till 6 in the morning like I do?
I can't explain this feeling
I think about it every day
And even though we've moved on
It gets so hard to
Walk away
(I'm gon' remember you)
(You gon' remember me)
Walk away
(Forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away
(I'm gonna remember you)
(You're gonna remember me)
Walk away
(I can't forget how we used to be)
