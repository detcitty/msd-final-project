Hello, hello, baby
You called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh?
You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
K-kinda busy, k-kinda busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh?
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kinda busy

Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna think anymore
I got my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't wanna talk anymore
I got my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me
