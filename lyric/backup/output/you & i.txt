I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time

I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other

Tight, like us?
Did they ever fight, like us?

You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'till the end
Nothing can come between

You and I
