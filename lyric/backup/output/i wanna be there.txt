Won't you let me catch your fall?
Won't you let me lend a hand?
Those lonely eyes have seen it all.
But love's too blind to understand.

Cause you don't know what you have
Til your everything is gone.
You need someone to show you
How to live again.

I wanna be there when you're feeling high.
I wanna be there when you wanna die.
I'm gonna light your fire, I'm gonna feel your flame.
I wanna be there when you go insane.
I wanna be there when you're feeling down.
And I'll be there when your head is spinnin 'round.
Gonna be your lover, gonna be your friend.
I wanna be there til the end.
