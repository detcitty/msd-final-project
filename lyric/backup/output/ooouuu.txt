Yo bro, I think I had too much Hennessy man
This Hennessy getting to me
I ain't gonna lie, I'm a little smizz
I'm a little drizz
But we in the club man, OOOUUU

Yea they hate but they broke though
(they broke though)
And when it's time to pop they a no-show
Yea I'm pretty but I'm loco
(yeah I'm loco)
The loud got me moving slow-mo
Ayo Tweetie, where the hoes bro?
(where the hoes bro)
Ayo Keys, where the hoes tho?
(where the hoes tho)
That other nigga, he a bozo
(he a bozo)
It's M.A, you don't know hoe?
(you don't know hoe)
We got liquor by the boatload (that Henny)
Disrespect the Lyfe that's a no-no
(that's a no-no)
All my niggas dressed in that rojo
(Redlyfe)
I ride for my guys, that's the bro code
