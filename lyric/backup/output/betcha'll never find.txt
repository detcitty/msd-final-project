I betcha'll never find another love like mine
Said I betcha'll never find another
I betcha'll never find another love like mine
Said I betcha'll never find another

I see it in your eyes
Don't play me for a fool
You know that I could always
Read between the lines

You seem to think
You want to find somebody new
Maybe we should take some
Time to be apart

I'm not gonna cry
I won't ask you why
If you're gonna go
Do what you got to do

I hope you know
What you're leaving behind
Because I know that I'm a special kind
A love this good, you'll never find

[CHORUS]
I betcha'll never find another love like mine
Said I betcha'll never find another
(You'll never, never, never find)
I betcha'll never find another love like mine
Said I betcha'll never find another
