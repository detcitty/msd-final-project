I like to do the things you like to do too
I like to do it, do it
I want to do the things you want to do too
So baby, let's get to it, do it

Sometimes no fun for peace of mind
Peace of mind
If you must do a peace, peace, peace of mind
Come on and do it, do it

Are you ready, are you ready for this
Do you like it, do you like it like this
Are you ready, are you ready for this
Do you like it, do you like it like this

Are you ready, are you ready for this
Do you like it, do you like it like this
Are you ready, are you ready for this
Do you like it, do you like it like this

Are you ready, are you ready for this
Do you like it, do you like it like this
Are you ready, are you ready for this
Do you like it, do you like it like this

Push, push in the bush (Say are you ready too)
Push, push in the bush (You know I like to jump)
Push, push in the bush (How 'bout if we could just)
Push, push in the bush (You know I want to get down)

Get down, get down, do it, do it

I like to do the things you like to do too
I like to do it, do it
I want to do the things you want to do too
So baby, let's get to it, do it

Sometimes no fun a peace, peace, peace of mind
Peace of mind
If you must do a peace, peace, peace of mind
Come on and do it, do it

Are you ready, are you ready for this
Do you like it, do you like it like this
