You're twistin' my melon man,
You know you talk so hip man,
You're twistin' my melon man (call the cops).

Hey rainmaker, come away from that man,
You know he's gonna take away your promised land,
Hey good lady, he just wants what you got you know,
He'll never stop until he's taken the lot.

He-he-hey, he-he-hey-hey.

Gonna stamp out your fire, 
he can change your desire,
Don't you know he can make you forget you're a man?
Gonna stamp out your fire, 
he can change your desire,
Don't you know he can make you forget you're a man, you're a man?
