Bounce
I ain't gon' take this no more, no
No baby, yeah, no

Bounce baby out the door
I ain't gon' take this no more
Bounce baby out the door
Get up and move
Don't make me act a fool

Just bounce baby out the door
I ain't gon' take this no more
Bounce baby out the door
Get up and move
Don't make me act a fool
Just bounce!

Said you're going with your boys today and
Don't worry 'cause I'll be home late
But I know you're cheatin' out there, creepin'
You've been freakin' babe

So let me tell you how it's going to be, yeah
And you can run your game but not on me boy
So who the hell are you trying to kid
You know this is what I did, I

I called your pager and your two-way boy but no response
Start looking and I found you in some other woman's arms
Don't try to front boy 'cause I saw you there with my own eyes
