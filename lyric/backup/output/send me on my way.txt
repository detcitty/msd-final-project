On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way

I would like to reach out my hands
I may see you, I may tell you to run
(On my way)
(On my way)
You know what they say about the young

Well, pick me up with golden hand
I may see you, I may tell you to run
(On my way)
(On my way)
You know what they say about the young

I would like to hold my little hand
How we will run we will, how we will crawl we will?
I would like to hold my little hand
How we will run we will, how we will crawl?

Send me on my way
(On my way)
Send me on my way
(On my way)
Send me on my way
