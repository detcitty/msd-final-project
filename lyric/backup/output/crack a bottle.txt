Eeeeeeeaahhh! oh! oh! Ladies and gentlemen
the moment you've all been waiting for
in this corner, weighing 175 pounds
with a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
the undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world

Slim Shady
So crack a bottle
let your body waddle
don't act like a snobby model
you just hit the lotto.
Uh-oh uh-oh
bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
got one riding shotgun
and no not one of 'em got clothes.
Now where's the rubbers?
Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em and
there's really not that many of us.

And ladies love us my posse's kickin' up dust

it's on till the break of dawn
and we're starting this party from dusk.
Ok, let's go!
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk.
Fix ya must, you'll be just another one bit the dust .
Just one of, my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus.
Kiss my butt, Lick Fromunda cheese from under my nuts.
It disgusts, me to see the game the way that it looks.
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed.
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup, the lady give her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
'cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse Than Worcestershire sauce.

If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes.
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room

I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true.
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
