What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me?
Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling
We've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
