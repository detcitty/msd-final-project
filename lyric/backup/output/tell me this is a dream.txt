You're the same old girl
That lived across the street
And you're the same old girl, yeah
That I was dying to meet

Well, now you're running around
And you think that I don't know
And you know if I found out
It's gonna hurt me so

And it hurts me so bad
Whoa, oh, oh, yeah

Tell me this is a dream
Somebody, please
Tell me this is a dream
Somebody, please
