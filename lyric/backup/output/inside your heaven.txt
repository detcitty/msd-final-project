I've been down, now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you I'm alive

You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
