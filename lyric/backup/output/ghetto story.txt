Here's my, ghetto story (*Story)
Been in hell through the fire, now, gonna take it higher (This a survival story, true ghetto story)
Here's my, ghetto story (*Story)
So many reasons to sing now, plus now we got the keys to the kingdom (This is my story, real ghetto story, hey)

(Verse 1: Baby Cham)
I remember those days when Hell was my home
When Me and Mama bed was a big piece a foam
An mi never like bathe and my hair never comb
When Mama gone a work me go street go roam
I remember when Danny dem tek me snow cone
An mek him likkle bredda dem kick up Jerome
I remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone
An the boy Danny pop out something weh full chrome
I remember when we run, Fatta get him knee blown
An mi best friend Richie get, two inna him dome
I remember so the avenue tun inna warzone
An, Mickey madda fly him out, cau she get a loan
But, Mickey go to foreign and go tun Al Capone
Mek whole heap a money and sen in our own
Now a we a lock the city and, that is well known
Yesterday Mickey call me pan mi phone
Mi say Mickey...

(Chorus: Baby Cham)
We get di ting dem
Dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now
We have whole heap a extra clip cau we nuh bruk now
