(Written by Bob Regan & Karen Staley)

You call and wake me up, the way you always do
Say you miss me and you're sorry, deja vu
You push the button in the heart you know so well
The wall starts coming down then I remind myself.

Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
