I'm talkin' bout love
All my girls stand in a circle and clap your hands this is for you
Ups and downs highs and lows no matter what you see me through
My boyfriend he don't answer on the telephone
I don't even know where the hell he goes
But all my girls we're in a circle and nobody's gonna break through

L, O, L, O, L, O, L.O.V.E
L, O, L, O, L, O
Oh did you hear me say?
L, O, L, O, L, O, L.O.V.E
L, O, L, O, L, O
Did you hear me say
L, O, L, O, L, O, L.O.V.E
L, O, L, O, L, O
Im talkin' bout
L, O, L, O, L, O, L.O.V.E
L, O, L, O, L, O

I'm talkin' bout love, say you'll be my girls for life girls for like
