All right
You're feelin' down
You're feelin' blue
You do know that you care
But you don't know what to do
If your mama don't feel good
Or your daddy don't feel good
Take a dose of rock 'n' roll
And wash it down with cool, clear soul, aha
You better get your ripple soles out
Ease out all your mean controls
