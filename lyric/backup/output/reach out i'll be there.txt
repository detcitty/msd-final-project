If you feel that you can't go on
'Cause all your hope is gone
And your life is filled with confusion

And happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is tumblin' down
Darling, reach out, reach out, reach out

I'll give you all the love you need
I'll be there
You can always depend on me

I can tell by the way you hang your head
Your with out of love, now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found

I know what you're thinking
You're alone now, no love of your own
Darling, reach out, reach out for me boy
