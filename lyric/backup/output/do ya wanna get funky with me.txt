DO YA WANNA GET FUNKY WITH ME
PETER BROWN

The lady smiled at me when she asked about the possibility
That we might spend some time alone
And oh the thoughts that filled my head
When she looked in my eyes and slowly said
Do ya wanna get funky with me, do ya wanna... oh!

The idle mind is a playground for the devil
Do ya wanna get funky with me, do ya wanna?
Do ya wanna get funky

The way she spoke to me told me I had the opportunity
