They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
But she wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture window (Whoo)
She finds a slinky vagabond (Whoo)
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing (Whoo)
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but (Whoo)
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song, she cries
"Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"

(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
Well, she wants the young American
