Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a player like oh
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy, can I?

Sexy, can I hit it from the front?
Can I hit it from the back? Know you like it like that
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
Then we chill for a second, then we’re back at it some more

Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a player like oh
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy, can I?

What up lil’ mama? It's ya boy Yunky
G5 dippin’, Louis Vuitton luggage
Ay, gotta love it, ya boy so fly
And all the ladies go oh when a ***** go by

Gucci on the feet, Marc Jacob on the thigh
She wanna ride or die with ya boy in the Chi
That's right, so I let her kiss the prince
Her boyfriend she ain't missed him since

Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
