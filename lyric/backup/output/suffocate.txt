Now even though I try to play it off.
Im thinking bout you all day long and
I cant wait for shorty to come through
From your lips and back up to your eyes
my hands on your hips when we grind im fantazing
Bout what im gon do to you.
You got me fiending for her love (can't lie)
Man you should see how she got me
Spending all this time with her (with her)
And I couldnt leave her if I wanted to her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do.

Chorus(2x)
Cause I cant breathe when you talk to me,
Cant breathe when your touching me
