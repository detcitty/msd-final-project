I'm gonna make you bend and break
(It sent you to me without wings)
Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show
(Let the good times roll)
(Let the good times roll)
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?"
If that's the worst you've got better put your fingers back to the keys

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories
