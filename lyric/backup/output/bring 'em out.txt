(Bring 'em out, Its hard to yell when the barrels in ya mouth) Swizzie!
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) Aye!
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) T.I.
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) Aye!

TIP comin live from the VIP, heard the night life lost life when I leave
Both the Feds and the State wanna see my need
The whole city got bizzerk he got treat
Anotha nigga got a hit but shawty he not me
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
Da king back now hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club stippers gettin naked 'fore I sat down
Still ballin money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road doin shows puttin my mack down
Mississippi to Philly Albuquerque to Chatt Town

I got the crowd yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
