I'm on one
(Get em on)
I'm on one
(Get em on)
I said I'm on one
I'm getting so throwed

I aint went this hard since I was 18
Apologise if I say, anything I don't mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?

And why they think it all comes so easy

But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations
I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking

Watch me take it!
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from

I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done

And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
