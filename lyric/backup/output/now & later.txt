I can be ya lifesaver
Treat me like a jawbreaker
You got 31 flavors, baby
You can get this now and later, now and later
You can get this now and later, now and later
It's your choice

Stop playin', you actin' like I don't do this
Build an empire, you Cookie, I'ma be Lucius
Give you good head until you get a contusion
If you don't come back, I think I'mma lose it
I think I'mma lose it
If I ever had ya number, I think I would use it
I'm feelin' some way, you know I hate losin'
If ya heart was in a bank, I'd rob it just to prove it
C'mon, you a mean diva
I'll grab your problems by the neck like I'm John Cena
You got a past, I ain't get to go to prom, either
So don't make it hard to believe that I ain't need ya
