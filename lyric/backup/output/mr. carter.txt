Yo, Drew and Inf, this right here is crazy
I feel big, you know what I mean?
Like not big in the sense of weight, you know what I mean?
Like gaining weight or nothing like that, like colossal
Know what I mean, like (*sighs*)
I heard you were lookin' for me


Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him)
Tell me where have you been? (Around the world now I'm back again)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Who been asking bout me?)
They've been wondering why (In case you wondering)
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him)
Tell me where have you been? (Around the world now I'm back again)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)


Yeah, to you forever; from me to you
I heard somebody say "Church," I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than "Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice"
I got the flow, I'm trying to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof
So I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do? But I'ma leave it to
God, not Beaver, neither you
â€˜Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O and even U
Man I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hating on me cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason


Hey Mr. Carter (I am him!)
Tell me where have you been?
(Around the world and I'm back again!)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
(Who's been askin' 'bout me?)
They've been wondering why? (In case you wonderin'! Hah!)
