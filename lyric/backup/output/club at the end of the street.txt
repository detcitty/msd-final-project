When the shades are drawn
And the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above
Walk the heavens hand in hand
There's a shady place
At the end of the working day
Where young lovers go
And this hot little trio plays

That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street
