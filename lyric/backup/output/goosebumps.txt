Yeah
7:30 in the night
Ooooh ooh

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worry about those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah

7-1-3 to the 2-8-1, yeah I'm riding
Why they on me? Why they on me? I'm flyin'
Sippin' lowkey I'm sipping lowkey in Onyx
Rider, rider when I'm pullin' up right beside ya
Popstar, lil' Mariah
When I text a cute game, wildness
