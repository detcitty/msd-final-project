There comes a time in a man's life
When he's tired of the games messing
around
He needs a good woman to settle down
And I'm at that time in my life
And I found what I needed in you

I swear I'll always be true
After searching and searching and
searching
What treasure I found in you
So baby I'm ready say you'll be my lady
And I'll give my all to you
