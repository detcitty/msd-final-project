Eyyy-yeaa
Yeeeaaaah
Heeeey, yeah
See ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day

And I'm makin it known cause, I just want the world to know
I'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for meeee, ye-yeah

I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'mma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York
"Juicy" had us feelin like we was from New York
And that's real shit, blazed the Philly
It's "Summertime", shout out to Will Smith
Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince?
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks
My nigga Nas told me "Money Make the World go Round"
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive

I used to think LL stood for "Love LA"
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
