Driving in the car
With the wind run through your hair
I reach for you now
But you're not there

It was perfect time
A perfect place for us to be
The nights were so warm
You were close to me
Was it nothing at all?

No more hope of holding your body in the moonlight
Did I fall in love for nothing?
No more hope of touching you feeling you by my side
