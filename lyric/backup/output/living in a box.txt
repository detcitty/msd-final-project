Woh oh
Woke up this morning
Closed in on all sides
Nothing doing
I feel resistance
As I open my eyes
Someone's fooling
I've found a way to break
Through this cellophane line
Cause I know what's going on

In my own mind
Am I living in a box
Am I living in a cardboard box
Am I living in a box

Am I living in a cardboard box
