There's a certain thing that
Happens when you're near me
And I think that I can see
Just how you feel

There's a certain thing that
Happens when you're near me
And I think that I can see
Just how you feel
So let me tell you one more time
I love you dearly
And I'll never put you down
Never let you go free

Annabelle, I got a feeling, girl
