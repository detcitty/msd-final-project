Hair nappy but I'm happy
pocket full of dough
from the C-O representing So So
The girls recognize and these niggas do too
I'm the flyest thing walking through jr. high school
so make room next to your little backstreet poster
cause bow wow's here and it's over
ya heard
I'm this
I'm that
I'm all of the above
And a big body shotgun riding on dubs
I've been seen with the baddest
heard with the best
And I got it locked down from the east to the west
Look in my eyes yall know
I ain't playing
That's why all through the streets all I'm hearing niggas saying is
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
Where my dogs at bark wit me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
And all my girls around the way that love how it's going down say
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
Where my dogs at bark wit me now
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yea
And all the girls around the way that love how it's going down
Now that the gate's wide open it is I who
they running from
little with the ill crossover
