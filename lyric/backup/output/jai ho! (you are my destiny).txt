Jai Ho)
(Jai Ho) I got (I got) shivers (shivers),
When you touch away,
I'll make you hot,
Get all you got,
I'll make you wanna say (Jai Ho)

I got (I got) fever (fever),
Running like a fire,
For you I will go all the way,
I wanna take you higher (Jai Ho)
I keep it steady uh-steady,
That's how I feel it.
This beat is heavy, so heavy,
You gonna feel it.

(Jai Ho)You are the reason that I breathe, (Jai Ho)
You are the reason that I still believe, (Jai Ho)
You are my destiny,
Jai Ho! Uh-uh-uh-oh!
(Jai Ho) No there is nothing that can stop us (Jai Ho)
Nothing can ever come between us, (Jai Ho)
So come and dance with me,
Jai Ho! (oh)

Catch me, catch me, catch me, c'mon, catch me,
I want you now,
I know you can save me, come and save me,
