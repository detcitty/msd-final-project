Oh, oh, oh, oh
Have a little mercy
Heaven knows I wouldn't hurt you, girl
So I told a lie I wanted to protect

But I shoulda known you'd hear the truth somehow
Now I'm terrified you're walking out
And the thought of losing you is killing me, babe
'Cuz I know that I'll go crazy without you

Forgive me, darling, will you have a little mercy on me?
I won't stop trying till you have a little mercy on me
Shoo, doo, doo, sho, do, do, do, do, sho, do, do, do, do
Have a little mercy on me

Acted selfishly and brought pain in your life
I know you don't believe me but I'm sorry
'Cuz I wanna make it up to you
Just let me show my love is true
And the thought of losing you is killing me, babe
'Cuz I know that I'll go crazy without you
