We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought: "Wow, if I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"

Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair
But I thought: "How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?"

If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
