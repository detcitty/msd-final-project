Oh, that's the way, uhh huh, uhh huh
I like it, uhh huh, uhh huh
That's the way, uhh huh, uhh huh
I like it, uhh huh, uhh huh

That's the way, uhh huh, uhh huh
I like it, uhh huh, uhh huh
That's the way, uhh huh, uhh huh
I like it, uhh huh, uhh huh

When you take me by the hand
Tell me I'm your loving man
When you give me all your love
And do it babe the very best you can

Oh, that's the way, uhh huh, uhh huh
I like it, uhh huh, uhh huh
That's the way, uhh huh, uhh huh
