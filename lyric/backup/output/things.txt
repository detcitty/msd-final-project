Every night
I sit here by my window
Staring at the lonely avenue

Watching lovers
Holding hands and laughing
And thinking 'bout the
Things we used to do

[CHORUS]
(Thinking of things)
Lke a walk in the park
(Things) like a kiss in the dark
(Things) like a sailboat ride
What about the night we cried
