I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, nigga I'm from New York
I got a semi automatic that spits next time if you talk
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips, nigga I'm from New York
I got a semi automatic that spits next time if you talk
And I know

Y'all niggaz is pussy, poonani, vagina
Your monologue's getting tired, now it's time to ride
You're print distrified, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire

I'm on fire, holly dipped in octane
Let each coast bang, let west coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushin' through in the sky blue

Back with the Gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin' at the speed of sound
Tryin' to catch the ears of niggaz that's runnin' their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggaz to run in your house

I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin' our prey out
