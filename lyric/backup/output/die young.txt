I hear your heart beat
to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night
Like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young

We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night

Like we're gonna die young
Drop

Let's make the most of the night
Like we're gonna die young

Young hearts, out our minds
Running still, we outta time
Wild childs, looking good
