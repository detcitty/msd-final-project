Two people livin' on the edge of life
Are people runnin' out of dreams and time
I can hear it when you tell me so
And I can feel it but I can' t let go

Two people gotta stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people gotta stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day
