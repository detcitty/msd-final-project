I want to feel that you're near whenever I call
I need to be in your eyes ten feet tall
Slow down, my head's spinnin 'round
Like I just stood up too fast
Woman you heal, my hungry feel
Each time you walk past
I would give you nearly everything
If you would only tell me just how much
You really really really really love me
Baby
