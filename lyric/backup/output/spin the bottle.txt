He's a movie star, only drives rented cars
Met him in a bar, said, "I know who you are"
Took him to my party as the games were starting
Bottle's on the ground, are you ready now?

When it comes to me, I'm gonna be ready
It's my turn in a minute
Gonna put my message in it
Five minutes in the closet with you
