Friday, I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game
Just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (oh yeah)

And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
