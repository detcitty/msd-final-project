Hello
Good morning
(Let's go, let's rock)
Hello
(Yeah, come on)
Good morning

Hello
Good morning
Know you been waitin'
For it

'Cause I seen
You watchin'
So let's go
Let's get it poppin'

'Cause I be leanin' on the bar lookin' cleaner than the Czar
And these ballers won't give me my props
Twenty-five on the bank, I be stuntin' on they ass
And they made 'case the bitch won't stop

Got your boyfriend feelin' like a groupie
You know, you know, we know we on that
Still life, dude, it's lookin' like a movie
You know, you know, we know we on that

And everybody know who the truth is
You know, you know, we know we on that
Eyes low 'cause I'm blowin' on that ooh-wee
You know, you know, we know we on that

Hello

Hello, good morning, how you doin' with the move here?
Welcome to the future, I'm the captain of the cool kids
The revolution's never been televised
Great booty, better thighs, I ain't wanna tell her bye

First, I tell her hi, then I give her one and let her fly
Never tell a lie, the night you couldn't find a better guy
King shit, flyer than anyone you been seen with
Gangster distinguished, cool as a penguin
