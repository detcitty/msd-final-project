I want to be just like you
I want to be just like you

I wanna be just like you
I wanna be just the same
Whoo!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I wanna be just like you
I wouldn't change a thing
I could be so cruel

You've got fingers that know where to touch me
Red lips like fruit on the vine
You set fire then tell me you're leaving
Just so you can lead me on some other night
