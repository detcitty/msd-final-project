You only love me for my

big sun glasses And my

Tony Lomas And my

Dodge Dart classic You said

"I'll be Johhny and you be June
I'll ride with you to the moon"

But guess what?

You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axel's dragin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like

Ooh,

ah,

ooh,

ah
