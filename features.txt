This is a list of all the potential features we will use to construct our linear regression.
- audio analysis (from spotify API) - these may be split into discrete buckets
   - tatum: shortest common time interval
   - beat: preferred human tapping tempo
   - bar: length of rhythmic pattern
   - tempo: speed at which section of music is played
- lyrics (scraped from music match) - these may be put into a document term matrix 
- number of tracks by a given artist that have already been on the charts
- album information (from spotify API) 
   - label: record label 
   - album type: single or full album? 
   - launch day: day, month, year (could interact with album genre) 
   - genre
