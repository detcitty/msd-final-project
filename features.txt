This is a list of all the potential features we will use to construct our linear regression.

1. audio analysis (from spotify API) - these may be split into discrete buckets
   > tatum: shortest common time interval
   > beat: preferred human tapping tempo
   > bar: length of rhythmic pattern
   > tempo: speed at which section of music is played

2. lyrics (scraped from music match) - these may be put into a document term matrix 

3. number of tracks by a given artist that have already been on the charts

4. album information (from spotify API) 
   - label: record label 
   - album type: single or full album? 
   - launch day: day, month, year (could interact with album genre) 
   - genre 

5. audio features (from spotify API)
