Modeling Social Data Final Project



Project Description
==========
Identifying Artist from song information. We'll be using acoustic features, song duration, lyrics, and other song data to identify the artist. We'll collect ~500 songs from ~25 artists, create a training and testing dataset. We'll find the parameters using cross-validation on the training set. Finally, we'll predict the artist for every song, and report the accuracy.
